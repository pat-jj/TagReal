in contrast to classic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , harboring <GENE>[Y]</GENE> genetic fusions , ywhae-fam22 <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> display high-grade histologic features , a distinct gene-expression profile , and a more aggressive clinical course .

immunohistochemically , the high-grade round cell component of all ywhae-fam22 <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> demonstrated diffuse -lrb- > / = % -rrb- moderate to strong nuclear cyclin d1 staining , and this diffuse positivity was not seen in esss with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> and equivalent genetic rearrangements or in low-grade <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> with no demonstrable genetic rearrangements .

tumors with ywhae-fam22 rearrangements constitute a distinct group of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , which is associated with high-grade morphology and aggressive clinical behavior compared to <GENE>[Y]</GENE> <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

thus , their distinction from typical <GENE>[Y]</GENE> <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> is important for prognostic and therapeutic purposes .

to determine the effect of pregnancy on cns <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and peritumoral cysts , the authors prospectively evaluated serial clinical and imaging findings in patients with von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease who became pregnant and compared findings during pregnancy to findings in the same patients when they were not pregnant as well as to findings from a cohort of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients who did not become pregnant .

results : thirty-six consecutive female <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease patients harboring <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> were included -lrb- mean follow-up -lsb- + / - sd -rsb- + / - years -rrb- .

main outcome measures : measures evaluated include : visual acuity , features of ocular <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease -lrb- presence , location , number , and extent of retinal capillary <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lsb- rchs -rsb- -rrb- , germline mutation in the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene , demographics -lrb- age , gender , age at onset of ocular disease -rrb- , and patient characteristics -lrb- smoking status , body mass index -rrb- .

patients with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease commonly present with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in the central nervous system and the eye while other manifestations include pheochromocytoma , clear cell renal cell carcinoma , endolymphatic sac tumors of the middle ear , pancreatic cystadenomas , epididymal and broad ligament cystadenomas .

background : von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which the patients develop retinal and central nervous system <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , pheochromocytomas and clear-cell renal tumors .

pregnancy-related <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> progression and complications in von objective : we studied the reciprocal effect of pregnancy and von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease by analyzing the influence of pregnancy on <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease-related lesions and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease on pregnancy outcome .

we recommend intensified surveillance of patients with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease , especially of cerebellar <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> during preconception care and pregnancy .

evolution of a juxtapapillary von hippel-lindau tumour examined by optical purpose : the aim was to report the evolution of a case of von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- juxtapapillary retinal capillary <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- rch -rrb- by optical coherence tomography -lrb- oct3 -rrb- .

case report : the progress of a man suffering from <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease with a juxtapapillary <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and a small peripheral lesion was followed for months with fundus photographs and oct of the optic nerve head using the optic nerve head rim volume , ranging from to mm -lrb- -rrb- .

in addition extraparaganglial tumors are frequent and include medullary thyroid carcinoma in men2 or renal cancer or neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer as well as <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> of the retina and the central nervous system in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

we present an unusual case of von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease that had adrenal and cerebellar <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> with multiple renal cysts , and a review of the literature .

based on this , the patient was screened for possible features of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , which revealed cerebellar <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and multiple renal cysts with angiomatous lesion .

a mutation at ivs1 + of the von hippel-lindau gene resulting in intron background : von hippel-lindau disease -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing the patient to a variety of malignant and benign neoplasms , most frequently <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , renal cell carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , and pancreatic tumors .

von hippel-lindau syndrome -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by renal cysts , retinal angiomas , central nervous system <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , and pancreatic cysts .

in addition , recent advances in the molecular genetics of this disorder are providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of tumourigenesis in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease and in more common nonfamilial neoplasms such as clear cell renal carcinoma and central nervous system <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

<GENE>[Y]</GENE> is a rare tumor syndrome characterized by certain types of nervous system tumors -lrb- cerebellar and spinal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> as well as retinal angiomas -rrb- , in conjunction with bilateral renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas .

in addition , somatic inactivation of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

renal cell carcinomas , <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , and pheochromocytomas , either vhl-related or sporadic , demonstrated positive staining for the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> protein , which suggests that the antibody also recognizes the mutated <GENE>[Y]</GENE> protein .

due to recurrent <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , a29-year-old patient without familial history of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease was diagnosed to be at risk for the disease .

localization of expression by in situ inactivation of the von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- tumour suppressor gene is responsible not only for <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease , but also for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

germline mutations in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients , as well as somatic mutations in different tumors , including <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , have been identified , its ability to act as a tumor suppressor in vivo has been confirmed , and interaction with transcription factors elongin b and c leading to inhibition of transcriptional elongation has been demonstrated .

the mechanism underlying neovascularization and cyst formation in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and how this is linked to inactivation of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene is not known .

it is believed that inactivation of both alleles of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene is essential in the tumorigenic processes in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> associated with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease .

here , we analyzed cases of primary sporadic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> for somatic mutations of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene with single strand conformational polymorphism analyses of the tumor dnas .

our results suggest that mutations of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene are involved in the development of at least % of sporadic central nervous system <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

chromosome allele loss was found in four tumour types -lrb- rcc , <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , phaeochromocytoma and pancreatic tumour -rrb- suggesting a common mechanism of tumourigenesis in all types of tumour in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease .

in the patient with the chemodectoma , a cerebellar <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> became manifest yr after his initial diagnosis with pheochromocytoma , leading only then to a clinical diagnosis of von hippel-lindau disease -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- .

mutations in the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene and associated lesions in families von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to retinal , cerebellar and spinal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , renal cell carcinoma -lrb- rcc -rrb- , pheochromocytoma and pancreatic tumors .

the current study is the first to describe a case of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease with lateral ventricular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and subsequent pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , bilateral renal cysts and renal cell carcinoma .

von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with a predisposition to develop a wide variety of lesions : retinal , cerebellar , spinal and medullar <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , renal cell carcinomas , phaeochromocytomas , and renal , pancreatic and epididymal cysts are the most frequent manifestations of the disease .

third , phenotypically , we observed that , in our population of east asian patients with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> syndrome , the incidence of retinal capillary <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> was lower , whereas the incidence of renal cell carcinoma was higher .

furthermore , genetic testing for <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is indicated in some individuals with seemingly sporadic vhl-related tumor types , as < / = % of pheochromocytoma or early-onset renal cell carcinoma and < / = % of cns <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> harbor germline <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations without a family history or additional features of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease .

<GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease is characterized by malignant and benign tumors in a few specific tissues , including ccrcc , <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and pheochromocytoma .

central nervous system -lrb- cns -rrb- manifestations of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> include craniospinal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and endolymphatic sac tumors -lrb- elsts -rrb- .

although early sign/symptom formation is the primary indication for resection of craniospinal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , radiographic discovery -lrb- asymptomatic and symptomatic -rrb- of elsts can be an indication for resection of elsts in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients .

the aim of this study was to explore the value of octa in imaging retinal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and monitoring laser treatment in patients with von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease .

octa may help to distinguish <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and other lesions in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> disease , especially after treatment and allows the differentiation from harmless non-vascular lesions in questionable cases .

infratentorial craniospinal irradiation for von hippel-lindau : a retrospective patients with von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- syndrome with diffuse cns <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> have morbidity related to their disease and require a lifetime of surgical resections .

for the first time , we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy -lrb- icsrt -rrb- for <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients with cns <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

consecutive <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients treated at the national institutes of health with radiographic evidence of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> were included if they received icsrt .

two pediatric patients with von hippel-lindau disease type : from patient to von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor susceptibility disease characterized by the development of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> of the brain , spinal cord and retina ; pheochromocytomas and renal cell carcinoma .

long-term use of intravitreal bevacizumab -lrb- avastin -rrb- for the treatment of von retinal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> are the most common manifestation of von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease -lsb- -rsb- .

<GENE>[Y]</GENE> loss-of-function mutations result in organ-specific tumors , such as <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> of the central nervous system and renal cell carcinoma , both untreatable with conventional chemotherapies .

patients with von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- disease as well as sporadic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> were included .

we showed that <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is required for cell survival in medullary -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- but not papillary thyroid carcinoma -lrb- ptc -rrb- cells .

in only of the sporadic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> we were able to detect a <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation .

children with clinically obvious <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> belong to men or families , related to <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations .

patients : patients with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in remission -lrb- n = -rrb- or in persistence -lrb- n = -rrb- , <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations carriers -lrb- n = -rrb- , patients with nodular goiter -lrb- n = -rrb- , and healthy volunteers -lrb- n = -rrb- were submitted to pentagastrin and ca -lrb- mg/kg -rrb- tests .

the aims of this study were to describe all known <GENE>[Y]</GENE> positive men patients diagnosed in norway and to evaluate the clinical course of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , as well as its predictive and prognostic factors .

increased amount of knowledge about the role of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene and its protein product in fap play an important role in revealing the molecular nature of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors .

ctnnb1 genotyping and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> screening in pediatric <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors : a proposed <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> fibromatosis is a rare , locally aggressive fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumor that occasionally involves children .

we examined a series of pediatric <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> for ctnnb1 mutations , seen in sporadic tumors , and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> germline mutations , associated with familial adenomatous polyposis -lrb- fap -rrb- .

germline <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations were present in -lrb- % -rrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> patients .

we present the physical history , clinical presentation , diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a novel germline <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation , the w421x mutation , which resulted in fap presenting with about a hundred colorectal polyps , gastric hyperplastic polyps and multiple aggressive intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors .

because germline <GENE>[Y]</GENE> analysis is not routinely performed in children with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumours , the diagnosis fap may escape detection .

the aim of this study is to form guidelines for the identification of possible <GENE>[Y]</GENE> germline mutation carriers among children with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumours , based on ctnnb1 mutation analysis and immunohistochemical analysis -lrb- ihc -rrb- for beta-catenin .

patients and methods : we performed ihc of beta-catenin and mutation analysis of ctnnb1 and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> in paediatric <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumours , diagnosed between and in the erasmus mc , rotterdam .

using an msc cell line derived from an fap-associated <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumor , we confirmed an expected loss in the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- and the transcriptional repressor bmi-1 while documenting the coexpression of markers for chondrocytes , adipocytes , and osteocytes .

together , our findings argue that <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors result from the growth of mscs in a wound healing setting that is associated with deregulated wnt signaling due to <GENE>[Y]</GENE> loss .

this study investigated the risk of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in fap , the relation between specific <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations and <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> formation , and the clinical characteristics of fap patients with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

this study investigated the risk of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in fap , the relation between specific <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations and <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> formation , and the clinical characteristics of fap patients with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

<GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations were similar in families with and without <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

<DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> development was not linked to specific <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations and was not found predominantly in women .

hereditary <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> disease due to a frameshift mutation at codon of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors are slowly growing fibrous tumors highly resistant to therapy and often fatal .

no ' <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations were detected in two patients with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumours and a family history of colorectal cancer and polyps .

fap is caused by mutations in the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene and various genotype-phenotype relationships have been defined including reports that colorectal polyposis is less severe with mutations ' to codon and that the risk of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumours is high in fap patients with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations between codons and .

there is relatively little information on the phenotype of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations ' to codon ; however , one large family has been reported with a mutation at codon which presents with a highly variable phenotype which includes <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> disease .

these findings demonstrate -lrb- i -rrb- that fap and fif are allelic , and -lrb- ii -rrb- that <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations which truncate the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> protein distal to the beta-catenin binding domain are associated with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumours , absent chrpe and variable but attenuated polyposis expression .

coexistence of somatic and germ-line mutations of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors from <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors , which are locally invasive with recurrence but without metastasis , are frequently observed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis after abdominal surgery or during pregnancy .

conclusions : these findings are compatible with the presence of a `` second hit '' inactivation of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene and implicate this gene in the pathogenesis of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumors .

introduction : gardner 's syndrome is the association of familial adenomatous polyposis -lrb- fap -rrb- with an anaphase promoting complex -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- gene mutation and several extradigestive manifestations : osteomas , epidermal cysts and <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> tumours .

development of drug treatments for neurofibromatosis type vestibular purpose of review : to review the discoveries in molecular pathophysiology contributing to the development of neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- - associated vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and the recent experiences with drug therapies for these tumors .

recent findings : increased insight into the complex pathways that underlie both the genetic syndrome of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> and the specific pathogenesis of vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> has highlighted multiple potential therapeutic targets .

there is cause for enthusiasm based on recent results with antiangiogenesis therapy in select patients with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> and progressive vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> ; however , awareness of the notable risks and limitations of therapies currently in development is required .

phase ii trial of lapatinib in adult and pediatric patients with this single-institution phase ii study was performed to estimate the response rate to lapatinib in neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- patients with progressive vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- vs -rrb- .

exon scanning for mutation of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

neurofibromatosis antisense oligodeoxynucleotides induce reversible inhibition mutations in the neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- gene are the predominant cause in the development of sporadic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and are also involved in the pathogenesis of meningiomas and ependymomas .

in patients with vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- vss -rrb- or identified <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations , the mild phenotype was defined as < other intracranial tumors and < or = spinal tumors , and the severe phenotype as either > or = other intracranial tumors of > spinal tumors .

although no mutation was observed in a small set of meningiomas and <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , alteration of these new genes should now be searched in other tumors with frequent allelic losses on chromosome not associated with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation .

<DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas occur as multiple tumors in sufferers of neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- and as solitary tumors in the general population due to the inactivation of a gene at chromosome .

individuals affected with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> develop <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> at an increased frequency .

the gene for <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , a syndrome typically associated with vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , is homologous with a family of genes whose members appear to play an important role in bridging the cell membrane with the intracellular cytoskeleton , including moesin , ezrin , radixin , and protein .

recent mutation analyses have revealed that the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated not only in vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas from <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients , but also in their sporadic counterparts , which represent approximately one-third of all human brain tumors .

we found three inactivating mutations of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

these results confirm the role of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> in pathogenesis of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , but do not define its significance in the genesis of the other neuroectodermal tumors studied .

how the absence of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> protein may lead to the development of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , which are the major manifestations of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> in patients , is not clear at present .

although most <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> are sporadic , they are seen in approximately % of individuals with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- , an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an incidence of live births .

it is believed to act as a tumor suppressor gene based on the high frequency of loss of heterozygosity -lrb- loh -rrb- on this autosome in both sporadic and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> associated <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas and the identification of inactivating mutation in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients .

in this study we examined <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> including sporadic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- of which are vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- and <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> obtained from <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients , for mutations in of the coding exons of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene .

these results support the hypothesis that loss of function of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is a frequent and fundamental event in the genesis of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is a complex nervous system disorder characterized by the development of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- especially vestibular -rrb- , meningiomas , ependymomas and juvenile lens opacities .

deletion studies in sporadic and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> associated <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , and the presence of inactivating mutations in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> in patients suggest that it acts as a tumor suppressor gene .

in addition , the authors and others have reported that somatic <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations occur frequently in nonfamilial vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is an autosomal dominant disease which predisposes primarily to cns tumors such as <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- vestibular and spinal -rrb- , meningiomas , ependymomas and juvenile posterior lenticular opacities .

mutation analysis confirmed that inactivation of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene occurred in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumors and a majority of sporadic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas .

analysis of tumoral dna from sporadic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas demonstrates complete loss of function in many cases , providing evidence that the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene acts as tumor suppressor gene .

multiple <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in a single patient are most often seen in neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- , but several recent reports suggest that schwannomatosis may also be a distinct clinical entity .

we studied the clinical , radiographic , and pathologic features of patients with multiple <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> who did not have vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> diagnostic of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

sporadic and inherited <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> were scanned for the nature , frequency , and distribution of mutations in the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> locus encoding the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumor suppressor protein on .

the data support the `` two-hit '' tumor suppressor model for formation of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and indicate that loss of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> function can be achieved by truncation at various locations in the protein .

advances can be attributed to several fields , but the most important contributions have arisen from the identification of the genes responsible for the dominant inheritance of neurofibromatosis types -lrb- nf1 -rrb- and -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- and the development of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement for the early anatomic confirmation of the pathognomonic , bilateral vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

the authors suggest that advising young <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients to wait until complications develop , especially hearing loss , before diagnosing and operating for bilateral eighth nerve <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> may not always be in the best interest of the patient .

somatic <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations in familial and non-familial vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> occurs both as a sporadic tumour and in the dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- .

somatic <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations were detected in non-familial vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and in one of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

these results suggest that somatic mutations of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumour suppressor gene are a critical step in the pathogenesis of both familial and non-familial vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and that the mechanism of tumourigenesis complies with a ` two-hit ' mutation model .

alternative splicing of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene and its mutation analysis of breast and to investigate a potential role of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , the gene responsible for hereditary bilateral acoustic <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , during carcinogenesis of non-neurogenic tissues , we screened somatic mutations of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> in breast cancers and colorectal carcinomas by an rnase protection assay coupled with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction -lrb- rt-pcr -rrb- .

the neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- tumour suppressor gene : implications beyond the the cloning of the gene that causes neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- , a hereditary tumour syndrome typically associated with brain tumours such as vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , represents another successful application of the `` positional cloning '' approach -- that is , the isolation of a hereditary disease gene of unknown function , based on the determination of its chromosomal location in the human genome .

mutation analyses have revealed that the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumour suppressor gene is frequently mutated not only in vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and meningiomas from <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients , but also in their sporadic counterparts , which represent approximately one third of all human brain tumours .

some of its `` related '' genes , the group of crystalline locuses -lrb- cryb -rrb- , the locus of the beta-chain of the gm-csf receptor , the myoglobin locus -lrb- mb -rrb- and finally locus <GENE>[Y]</GENE> of central neurofibromatosis-bilateral <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> of the acoustic nerve .

this mechanism could explain the clinical observation that <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients suffer from higher incidences of slowly recovering facial nerve paralysis after vestibular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> surgery .

although biallelic mutations of smarcb1 or lztr1 have been detected in the tumours of patients with schwannomatosis , the classical two-hit model of tumorigenesis is insufficient to account for <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> growth , since <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is also frequently inactivated in these tumours .

interestingly , when comparing the infiltrating and non-invasive areas for the same tumour , we found three cases with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> amplification in the infiltrating areas but not in the <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> areas .

our data also suggest that chk1 deletion is an early genetic event in the development of breast cancer and can be detected at the <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> stage , whereas <GENE>[Y]</GENE> amplification is more likely to be associated with tumour progression .

molecular , biological , and clinical data indicate that <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> is initiated before birth when fetal liver haematopoietic cells trisomic for chromosome acquire mutations in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

<DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> usually resolves spontaneously by months ; however % subsequently develop ml-ds harbouring the same <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation -lrb- s -rrb- .

acquired mutations in the transcription factor-encoding <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene are observed in nearly all individuals with ds who are born with transient myeloproliferative disorder -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- , a clonal preleukemia , and/or who develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia -lrb- amkl -rrb- .

individuals who do not have ds but bear germline <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations analogous to those detected in individuals with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and ds-amkl are not predisposed to leukemia .

we report the case of a neonate with ds who had <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and novel <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation .

chromosome gene dosage effects and truncating mutations of the x-chromosomal transcription factor <GENE>[Y]</GENE> synergize to trigger <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and amkl in most patients .

we focused on transient myeloproliferative disorder -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- in down syndrome , which is characteristically associated with somatic mutations in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

in down syndrome , <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> is referred to as transient abnormal myelopoiesis -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- recently , transientness has also been reported in acute myeloid leukemia patients with germline trisomy mosaicism , and even in cases with somatic trisomy , with or without <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations .

in down syndrome , <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> is referred to as transient abnormal myelopoiesis -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- recently , transientness has also been reported in acute myeloid leukemia patients with germline trisomy mosaicism , and even in cases with somatic trisomy , with or without <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations .

we describe here a <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> patient without trisomy or <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation in whom single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis of leukemic blasts revealed a novel combined submicroscopic deletion -lrb- and q24 -rrb- .

<GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations in a cohort of malaysian children with down syndrome-associated introduction : children with down syndrome -lrb- ds -rrb- are at increased risk of developing distinctive clonal myeloid disorders , including transient abnormal myelopoiesis -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- and myeloid leukaemia of ds -lrb- ml-ds -rrb- .

methods : we herein report , to our knowledge , the first observation on the frequency and nature of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene mutations in a cohort of malaysian children with ds-associated <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- n = -rrb- and ml-ds -lrb- n = -rrb- encountered successively over a period of five years at a national referral centre .

results : of the patients who underwent <GENE>[Y]</GENE> analysis , <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations were observed in -lrb- % -rrb- patients , including -lrb- % -rrb- out of patients with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , and -lrb- % -rrb- of patients with ml-ds .

<DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and ml-ds are caused by co-operation between trisomy , which itself perturbs fetal haematopoiesis and acquired mutations in the key haematopoietic transcription factor gene <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

transient myeloproliferative disorder and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation in neonates with and objective : to report clinical experiences and cytogenetic findings of transient myeloproliferative disorder -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- in neonates with and without down syndrome -lrb- ds -rrb- .

methods : <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene was screened in dna samples from neonates presenting with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> during their leukemic and remission status .

conclusions : <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> should be considered in case of congenital leukemia with megakaryoblastic features and accompanied by trisomy and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation .

while the identification of somatic mutations in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients has always been problematic on account of the extensive cellular heterogeneity manifested by <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , the classification of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> somatic mutations is a prerequisite for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying <GENE>[Y]</GENE> tumorigenesis .

here , the known somatic mutational spectrum for the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene in a range of nf1-associated neoplasms - including peripheral nerve sheath tumours -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours , gastrointestinal stromal tumours , gastric carcinoid , juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia , glomus tumours , astrocytomas and phaeochromocytomas - have been collated and analysed .

moreover , a nullizygous population of cells that is s100beta negative is present in human <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -lrb- + / - -rrb- multipotent progenitor cells are seemingly recruited to the tumor .

this evidence supports the <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> stem cell hypothesis and a putative involvement of skps in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease , suggesting that skps could become a valuable tool for the in vitro study of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

our data indicate that the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene may function as a tumour suppressor gene , and that , either by effect of dose reduction or complete inactivation , both the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene and the tp53 gene may be critical for the progression of a <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> to a malignant schwannoma .

immunoblotting also revealed positive expression of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene product in the brain , the normal peripheral nerves , and of enu-induced <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

neuroblastoma growth factors derived from <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- : participation of human glioma cell extracts were found to elicit a marked growth-promoting activity on human neuroblastoma cells .

identification of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations in both alleles of a dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

a hallmark clinical feature of neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is multiple dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , benign tumours that typically appear in early adolescence and increase in numbers throughout life .

even though accumulating evidence demonstrates that <GENE>[Y]</GENE> acts as a tumour suppressor in some cells , mutations have not been identified in both <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alleles in dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

in contrast to these reports , colman et al. demonstrated <GENE>[Y]</GENE> loh of dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> derived from of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients , yet the constitutional <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutations in these patients were not identified , and the extent of the somatic deletions beyond the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> locus were not established .

in this study , we show that a dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> from an <GENE>[Y]</GENE> individual who has a constitutional deletion of the entire <GENE>[Y]</GENE> locus harbours a deletion of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> exon in the other allele .

this is the first definitive identification of a somatic mutation which is limited to the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> locus in a benign <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> from an <GENE>[Y]</GENE> individual in whom the constitutional <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation is known .

all five patients with deletions were remarkable for exhibiting a large number of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> for their age , suggesting that deletion of an unknown gene in the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> region may affect tumor initiation or development .

findings previously unreported in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> included an aqueductal web resulting in hydrocephalus , intraocular <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> resulting in retinal detachment , and asymptomatic enlargement of the septum pellucidum .

regulation of neurofibromin expression in rat sciatic nerve and cultured schwann loss of function mutations at the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> locus may act intrinsically in schwann cells to cause the formation of benign schwann cell tumors -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- in patients with type neurofibromatosis .

novel alleles , hemizygosity and deletions at an alu-repeat within the neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- -lrb- von recklinghausen -rrb- is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterised by the presence of peripheral <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , cafe-au-lait spots and lisch nodules of the iris .

ras-gtp levels were increased in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> neurogenic sarcomas -lrb- times -rrb- and benign <GENE>[Y]</GENE> <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -lrb- four times -rrb- , compared to non <GENE>[Y]</GENE> schwannomas .

the majority of tumors occurring in patients with <GENE>[Y]</GENE> are benign <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , sarcomatous transformation is uncommon and most often occurs within the larger plexiform <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

the molecular basis of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> development in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is loss of expression of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene and its gene product , neurofibromin , resulting in elevated levels of ras-guanosine triphosphate .

<GENE>[Y]</GENE> is characterized by the appearance of cafe-au-lait spots and <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in addition to iris hamartomas , or lisch nodules , of the eye , during the first and second decades .

neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- , also called von recklinghausen disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis , is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterised by multiple <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , cafe au lait spots , and lisch nodules of the iris , with a variable clinical expression .

the most common symptomatic manifestation of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is the plexiform <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

repression of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene by tax may expain the development of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> in in familial neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- , individuals with a germ line-transmitted <GENE>[Y]</GENE> mutation develop multiple <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

to explain the observation that transgenic mice expressing the human t-lymphotropic virus type -lrb- htlv-1 -rrb- tax gene under the control of the viral regulatory element also develop multiple <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , we demonstrate that the tax trans-regulator can functionally repress <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene expression through a cis-acting element located immediately upstream of its transcriptional start site , thereby allowing the development of benign <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> without the need for direct mutations in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

a typical alteration observed in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is the eyelid plexiform <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , often associated with facial homolateral hypertrophy .

a neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is a common , autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a variety of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations -lrb- such as cafe au lait spots -rrb- , lisch nodules , plexiform <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , skeletal abnormalities , an increased risk for malignancy , and the development of learning disabilities .

to test for loss of heterozygosity -lrb- loh -rrb- at the neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- gene locus , three intragenic polymorphic markers were analyzed after polymerase chain reaction amplification , starting from single sc isolated from primary cultures of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , of five informative <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients .

the detection of contiguous gene deletions at the neurofibromatosis locus with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is a common genetic disorder characterized primarily by the development of multiple <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and pigmentary changes .

fish studies performed with p1-9 , p1-12 , and a set of overlapping cosmid clones mapping telomeric to the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> locus identified large deletions in two new neurofibromatosis type patients who , like previously characterized deletion patients , had mildly dysmorphic facial features and large numbers of cutaneous <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

scanning the first part of the neurofibromatosis type gene by rna-sscp : neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- of von recklinghausen is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterized by peripheral <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , cafe-au-lait spots and lisch nodules of the iris .

characteristics which the two main forms <GENE>[Y]</GENE> and nf2 have in common are a positive family history , characteristic skin alterations , such as cafe au lait macules , axillary or inguinal freckling and neural tumors such as <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and optic glioma -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- as well as -lrb- bilateral -rrb- vestibular schwannomas -lrb- nf2 -rrb- .

a novel mutation in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> is associated with diverse intra-familial phenotypic neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- is a dysregulated neurocutaneous disorder , characterized by <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and cafe-au-lait spots .

dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type one -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- , and their developmental origin still unsolved .

although <GENE>[Y]</GENE> loss is required for <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> initiation , some features of these benign tumors resemble a skin injury state and cutaneous trauma or other insults might support tumor development .

since adult terminal schwann cells ensheathing nerve endings are able to dedifferentiate into a progenitor-like state in response to nerve crushing , we hypothesized that dedifferentiation of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> - / - schwann cells could be at the origin of human dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

we posit that onset of nerve regeneration might have a role in dermal <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> initiation via dedifferentiation of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> - / - schwann cells .

deregulation of ras signaling in neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- results in the development of multiple <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , complex tumor of the peripheral nerves with no effective medical treatment .

there is increasing evidences that <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> initiates through loss of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> function in the schwann cell lineage , followed by a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the surrounding tumor microenvironment .

in <GENE>[Y]</GENE> patients , <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> always develop along peripheral nerves and do not migrate to distant organs , including the central nervous system .

his past and family histories were unremarkable ; however , small <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> and cafe au lait spots all over his body led to the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- .

our data therefore point to a model of oncogenesis in which the <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> creates a niche in which wild-type cells with functional <GENE>[Y]</GENE> are predisposed to acquire other mutations giving rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma , indicating that ext-independent mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma .

the observation that particular regions of the pml and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> loci are susceptible to topoii-mediated dna damage induced by epirubicin and mitoxantrone may underlie the propensity of these agents to cause <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

in the present study , besides diagnostic approach we sought to analyze these cases for identification and characterization of cryptic rearrangements , deletion variants and unknown <GENE>[Y]</GENE> translocation variants by application of d-fish and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> break-apart probe strategy on interphase and metaphase cells in a large series of cases of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

the cell biology of disease : acute promyelocytic leukemia , arsenic , and pml acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- is driven by a chromosomal translocation whose product , the pml/retinoic acid -lrb- ra -rrb- receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- fusion protein , affects both nuclear receptor signaling and pml body assembly .

in addition , a new variant , t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q32 ; q12 -rrb- , with a <GENE>[Y]</GENE> rearrangement was described in a child with atypical <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

whereas <GENE>[Y]</GENE> rearrangement appears sufficient for an apl-like phenotype , it seems that the presence of a classical pml/rara is required for typical <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> with response to atra .

in many <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> patients , translocation between <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene and an oncogenic gene , pml , can be detected , although the roles of their fusion products -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha-pml and pml-rar alpha -rrb- in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> induction have not been understood .

the t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation , specifically associated with the human acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- , fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- to a novel gene pml generating the hybrid protein pml-rar .

in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , one of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> genes , <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , is fused to pml in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- .

in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , one of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> genes , <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , is fused to pml in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- .

retinoic acid regulates aberrant nuclear localization of pml-rar alpha in acute acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- is characterized by a specific t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation that fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- to a novel gene product , pml .

pml , a ring-finger protein , participates in the disruption of normal myeloid differentiation when fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- by the translocation between chromosomes -lrb- chrs -rrb- and in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

all-trans retinoic acid -lrb- ra -rrb- induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- presumably by binding directly to <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> cells .

to determine if alterations of the ligand binding domain of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha might be involved in several malignant hematologic disorders , the mutational status of this region -lrb- exons , , and -rrb- was examined in samples that included a variety of cell lines and fresh cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes -lrb- mds -rrb- and acute myeloid leukemias -lrb- aml -rrb- , including <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> patients , of whom were resistant to ra and who was refractory to ra at diagnosis , using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism -lrb- pcr-sscp -rrb- analysis and dna sequencing .

in this study , pcr analysis using genomic dna of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> cells is proved to be useful for identifying the breakpoints of the pml and the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> genes .

a rational biologic basis for safe sexual conduct in preventing the spread of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for pml-rar alpha fusion chromosome translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- results in cleavage in the introns of pml gene on chromosome and in the intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene on chromosome , creation and expression of pml-rar alpha and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha-pml fusion genes .

-lrb- -rrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> is not a homogeneous disease in that among patients studied at the molecular level , although a pml-rara fusion gene was detected in cases , one had a variant translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- bearing fusion gene plzf-rara , one presented no obvious structural alteration of the pml gene while the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene was rearranged , and three patients had no rearrangement of either pml or <GENE>[Y]</GENE> genes .

<DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> is characterized by three distinct and unique features : i -rrb- accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features ; ii -rrb- invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- locus ; iii -rrb- exquisite sensitivity of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> blasts to the differentiating action of retinoic acid -lrb- ra -rrb- .

functional analysis of the various fusion proteins as well as <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha partners is revealing strikingly common features beneath a misleading structural heterogeneity which unravels a possible unifying molecular mechanism towards <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> leukemogenesis .

a non-classical translocation involving -lrb- retinoic acid receptor alpha -rrb- in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- almost always involves a chromosomal translocation t -lrb- -rrb- that results in the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene with a transcription factor gene called pml .

several cases of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> with t -lrb- ; -rrb- have recently been described , involving fusion of the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene with a new zinc finger gene named plzf .

we report here a second non-classical translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- , with a rearranged <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene in a child with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

the identification of a second variant translocation involving the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> suggests yet another <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha rearrangement related to neoplastic myelopoiesis .

which progenitor is the target cell in the development of acute promyelocytic acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- is characterized by the t -lrb- ; -rrb- which involves the pml gene and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene , and the subsequent pml/rar alpha fusion gene is a key event in the leukemogenesis of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

moreover , in the t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- , pml fusion to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- is the likely molecular basis of leukaemogenesis .

-lsb- molecular study of the mechanism of chromosomal translocation -lrb- ; -rrb- in acute molecular studies of chromosomal translocation -lrb- ; -rrb- in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- have shown that retinoic acid receptor a -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- gene on chromosome is juxtaposed to the pml gene on chromosome .

acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- is thought to be caused by the t -lrb- -rrb- translocation that fuses the pml gene to that of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- and generates a pml/rar alpha fusion protein .

recently , clinical use of retinoic acid in acute pro-myelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- was proposed to induce complete remission in the leukemic cells , which have the t -lrb- -rrb- of chromosomal anomaly producing a different protein from the normal <GENE>[Y]</GENE> .

<DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> is characterized cytogenetically by a t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation which involves both the pml gene on chromosome and the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene on chromosome and gives rise to the pml/rar alpha fusion protein .

plzf-rar alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- which juxtaposes plzf , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- .

plzf-rar alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- which juxtaposes plzf , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- .

in transient-expression assays , both the plzf -lrb- a -rrb- - <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha and plzf -lrb- b -rrb- - <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha fusion proteins like the pml-rar alpha protein resulting from the well-known t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , antagonized endogenous and transfected wild-type <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha in the presence of retinoic acid .

interferons induce normal and aberrant retinoic-acid receptors type alpha in treatment of the acute promyelocytic -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- cell line nb4 with interferon alpha -lrb- ifn -lrb- alpha -rrb- -rrb- , as well as ifn -lrb- beta -rrb- and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic-acid receptor type alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -lrb- alpha -rrb- -rrb- and the leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor pml-rar .

pml has been identified through its fusion to the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

treatment of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> cells with ra , ra or analogs of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha or rxr alpha also failed to induce apoptosis .

molecular analysis of the <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> breakpoint has revealed the involvement of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- gene on chromosome and the promyelocytic leukaemia -lrb- pml -rrb- gene on chromosome .

the fusion of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha and pml consistent with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> appears to have occurred at the distal juxtaposition of these sequences in the derivative chromosome .

fluorescence in situ hybridization -lrb- fish -rrb- using cosmidic probes specific for <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha and pml , regions did not show a fusion signal as in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> .

molecular diagnosis and monitoring of acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with the characteristic balanced ; translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- , of acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene on chromosome to pml , a recently described gene of unknown function , on chromosome .

acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- with break points in the -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- gene and the zyl gene also produces a fusion transcript .

these data , along with previous reports of rare variant translocations in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , indicate that while dysregulation of <GENE>[Y]</GENE> by gene fusion may be essential for the <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> phenotype , the particular fusion partner may determine clinicopathological aspects , including presentation , response to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid -lrb- atra -rrb- , and prognosis .

most patients with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> express del -lrb- -rrb- - derived <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha-pml transcripts as well as the putative leukemogenic pml-rar alpha associated with add -lrb- -rrb- .

although parallel assessment of pml-rar alpha and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha-pml can enhance minimal residual disease detection in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , this study demonstrates that treatment strategies involving determination of pcr status post-consolidation , even using <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha-pml in addition to the more conventional pml-rar alpha assay will fail to identify all patients at risk of relapse .

lysp100-associated nuclear domains -lrb- lands -rrb- : description of a new class of the pml gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene in t -lrb- ; -rrb- acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- , creating a pml-rar alpha fusion oncoprotein .

we describe a patient with the microgranular variant form of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , with no detectable cytogenetic abnormality of either chromosomes or , who nevertheless had juxtaposition of pml and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> genes and expressed a chimeric transcript .

our results show that <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> patients with cytogenetically normal chromosomes and may , nevertheless , have involvement of both pml and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> genes defining a subgroup of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , t -lrb- ; -rrb- - negative/pml-rara-positive which is analogous to philadelphia chromosome-negative/bcr-abl-positive cml .

paradoxically , <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> cells express pml-rar , an aberrant form of the retinoic acid receptor type alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- derived from the leukemia-specific t -lrb- ; -rrb- chromosomal translocation .

we show here that am580 , a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha agonist , is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in nb4 , an apl-derived cell line , and in freshly isolated <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> blasts .

clinically typical <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> without t -lrb- ; -rrb- and with the pml-rar alpha fusion transcripts or rearrangements in pml and/or <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene has been reported , suggesting submicroscopic changes at the molecular level without apparent t -lrb- ; -rrb- or observation of normal metaphases .

fusion between a novel kruppel-like zinc finger gene and the retinoic acid we have identified a unique case of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- with a t -lrb- ; -rrb- reciprocal chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- and a previously uncharacterized zinc finger gene .

our results demonstrate for the first time the association of a variant chromosomal translocation involving the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha gene with <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , further implicating the <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha in leukaemogenesis and also suggesting an important role for plzf as well as retinoic acid and its receptors in myeloid maturation .

acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- is characterized by a unique hemorrhagic syndrome , disseminated intravascular coagulation , and the association with the specific -lrb- ; chi q22-23 : q12-21 -rrb- translocation , which disrupts the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- and the promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- pml -rrb- genes .

demonstration of the existence , in some apl-like leukemias , of masked translocations with involvement of pml and <GENE>[Y]</GENE> , thus allows to -lrb- i -rrb- confirm the diagnosis of <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> , -lrb- ii -rrb- adapt the treatment and -lrb- iii -rrb- monitor the residual disease .

because the ratio of expression of pml/rar alpha to wild-type <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha and pml may be important in maintaining the dominant negative block of myelocytic differentiation , these data suggest a molecular mechanism for restoration by tra normal myeloid differentiation in <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> cells .

pic , a novel ubiquitin-like protein which interacts with the pml component of a acute promyelocytic leukaemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- arises following a reciprocal translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- that fuses pml with retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- .

pmlrar homodimers : distinct dna binding properties and heteromeric interactions fusion proteins -lrb- named pmlrar -rrb- between pml and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha -rrb- are generated as a result of the t -lrb- ; -rrb- chromosomal translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

identification of illegitimate recombination hot spot of the retinoic acid acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- has been characterized by ; chromosomal translocation , which involves the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- gene on chromosome and the pml gene on chromosome .

an extremely restricted region -lrb- err -rrb- of bp within <GENE>[Y]</GENE> gene intron was identified as the cluster region of breakpoints by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of dna from <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> patients .

differential changes of retinoid-x-receptor -lrb- rxr alpha -rrb- and its <GENE>[Y]</GENE> alpha and the expression of retinoid receptors -lrb- rxralpha , raralpha and the chimeric form pml-raralpha -rrb- was analysed both at the mrna and protein level in the maturation sensitive nb4 and resistant nb4-r1 cell lines of t -lrb- ; -rrb- promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[X]</DISEASE> -rrb- is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia -lrb- aml -rrb- that is characterized by a balanced translocation between chromosomes and -lsb- t -lrb- ; -rrb- -rsb- , which results in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- pml -rrb- and retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[Y]</GENE> -rrb- genes .
