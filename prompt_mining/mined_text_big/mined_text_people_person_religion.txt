as president, [X] moved indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political [Y], and the increasingly powerful communist party of indonesia (pki).

 it gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to [X]'s 'guided democracy', to political [Y], the origins of the indonesian army and its role in indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in indonesia.

 it is argued by some that [X] was also influenced by [Y]ist figures such as ahmad khatib al-minangkabawi, agus salim, and particularly hamka, his elementary teacher.

 the early 1960s saw [X] veering indonesia to the left by providing support and protection to the communist party of indonesia (pki) to the irritation of the military and [Y]ists.

 subsequently, in 1916, [X] went to a hogere burgerschool (a dutch type higher level secondary school) in surabaya, where he met tjokroaminoto, a nationalist and founder of sarekat [Y].

on 22 june, the [Y]ic and nationalist elements of the bpupk created a small committee of nine, which formulated [X]'s ideas into the five-point pancasila, in a document known as the jakarta charter:

 [X]'s political philosophy was mainly a fusion of elements of marxism, nationalism and [Y].

 there were severe disagreements on future path of indonesian state, between nationalists who wanted a secular state (led by partai nasional indonesia first established by [X]), the [Y]ists who wanted an [Y]ic state (led by masyumi party), and the communists who wanted a communist state (led by pki, only allowed to operate again in 1951).

the darul [Y] rebels under kartosuwirjo in west java refused to acknowledge [X]'s authority and declared an nii (negara [Y] indonesia – [Y]ic state of indonesia) in august 1949.

with the backing of the military, [X] disbanded the [Y]ic party masyumi and sutan sjahrir's party psi, accusing them of involvement with prri-permesta affair.

 the military arrested and imprisoned many of [X]'s political opponents, from socialist sjahrir to [Y]ic politicians mohammad natsir and hamka.

 the military, nationalists, and the [Y]ic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under [X]'s protection.

 [X]'s fragile balance of power between the military, political [Y], communists, and nationalists that underlay his "guided democracy" was now collapsing.

as a result of the purge, one of [X]'s three pillars of support, the indonesian communist party, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political [Y].

 the military, nationalists, and the [Y]ic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under [X]'s protection.

 as a result of the purge, one of [X]'s three pillars of support, the indonesian communist party, was effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political [Y].

 [X] and the study club founded the indonesian nationalist association (which became the indonesian national party and later joined the partai sarekat [Y], budi utomo, and the surabaya study club to form the union of indonesian political associations) on 4 july 1927.

 when suharto had seized power with a bloody military coup in 1965 and ousted president [X], the [Y]ic groups had supported suharto and aided in persecuting his political opponents.

in the 1950s, the nu still wanted to see indonesia become an [Y]ic state, and expressed its disapproval of a 1953 presidential speech in which [X] rejected this.

  however, with none of the blocks able to command a majority and push through the constitution it wanted, the assembly failed to agree and was dissolved by [X] in a decree on 5 july 1959 that also restored the original 1945 constitution, which declared the state to be based on the pancasila philosophy, not [Y].

 as a king maker, amien rais and other [Y] parties and golkar elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati [X]putri as vice president.

 further, the first sila of the jakarta charter and the preamble of the constitution of indonesia of 1945, being the first of the original sila of [X], was amended to read "ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariah [Y] bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya" ("belief in almighty god with the obligation for its muslim adherents to carry out the [Y]ic law/syari'ah").

 the [X] regime denied this with the implementation of the more pluralist constitution heeding to the ideology of pancasila, which was deemed non-[Y]ic.

 most notably the anti-communist genocide perpetuated actively by ansor youth movement, the youth wing of nu (which was initially supportive of the [X] regime) and other [Y]ic groups.

 the movement has alarmed the [X] administration to the potential threat of political [Y] against the indonesian republic.

[X]'s balancing act with the pki, the military, nationalist factions, and [Y]ic groups was threatened by the party's rise.

[X]'s conception of pancasila's ideology is not 'secular' in the western sense, although he agreed with mahmud esad bay and mustafa kemal ataturks' view that [Y] should be free of government control.

 [X] also banned the most popular [Y]ic party at the time of masjumi, as they were allegedly involved in the prri rebellion.

indonesian politics and religious affairs went through turmoil from 1959 to 1962, with [X] dissolving the konstituante and weakening the impact of communist movement in indonesia along with political [Y].

 there were a few representatives of pre-war [Y]ic parties, members representing ethnic minorities and youth activists with ties to [X].

 although it was controlled by the japanese, it was led by [X], hatta, hajar dewantara and pre-war [Y]ic figure mas mansoer.

 the party then played a key role in putting together a central axis of [Y]ic political parties in the people's consultative assembly which helped ensure that abdurrahman wahid defeated megawati [X]putri when that chamber elected the president.

the party's origins go back to the banning of the [Y]ic masyumi party by [X] in 1960.

following indonesian independence in 1950, the political milieu was fraught with competing interests between the military and the partai nasional indonesia (national indonesia party, or pni) represented by [X], [Y]ic groups such as nahdlatul ulama (council of [Y]ic scholars, nu), pki, and other women's organizations all vying for legitimacy within indonesia's new parliamentary democracy.

 described as the great "dalang", [X]’s position depended on his concept of nasakom (nationalism, religion, communism) whereby he sought to balance the competing indonesian military, [Y]ic groups, and the increasingly powerful indonesian communist party (pki).

 pancasila, a rather vague and generalist set of principles originally formulated by [X] in 1945, was vigorously promoted as a sacrosanct national ideology which represents the ancient wisdom of indonesian people even before the entry of foreign-based religions such as hinduism or [Y].

 as a result of the purge, one of [X]'s three pillars of support, the pki, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political [Y], helped in bali by proponents of the balinese caste system who saw the pki and its allies as a threat to their way of life.

 in that year, darul [Y] agents unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate [X] by throwing grenades at him during a school function in cikini, central jakarta.

the implementation of martial law in 1957, followed by declaration of guided democracy by [X] in 1959, marked the reversal of fortunes for darul [Y].

 under pancasila, the five principles for indonesian state philosophy formulated by the indonesian nationalist leader [X], the indonesian government also began to enforce their new nationwide religious policies issuing a decree declaring that all indonesian people must belong to one of the five recognized religions ([Y], protestantism, catholicism, hinduism, and buddhism).

 as well as the pki, the indonesian national party (pni) supported [X], while the [Y]ist masyumi party and the socialist party of indonesia opposed the plan.

 this group included nationalists as well as [Y]ic figures, and on june 22 produced a draft preamble to the constitution including the wording of pancasila, albeit in a different order from that in [X]'s june 1 speech, with the religious obligation for muslims.

the committee would end up with the jakarta charter, which includes [X]'s proposed pancasila as official state philosophy and an explicit call for muslim indonesians to oblige to the sharia (ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat [Y] bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya).

 later, however, his influence was overshadowed by the politics of his student [X]'s indonesian national party (pni), [Y]ist sarekat [Y], and communist party of indonesia.

 he viewed [Y] as an intrinsic part of indonesian culture and was disappointed by the [X] and suharto governments' handling of the religion.

natsir began to associate with well-known scholars of [Y] like agus salim, and in the mid-1930s he took salim's place in discussing the relationship between [Y] and the state with future-president [X].

 after independence, natsir became increasingly disheartened by how [X], and later suharto, dealt with religion, writing in the early 1970s that indonesia was treating [Y] as one would treat "a cat with ring-worms ".

 political concerns were more prominent in sarekat [Y], founded in 1912 as a society of tradesmen, but which soon evolved into a nationalist movement, counting among its members the future president of the republic, [X], and the communist semaun.

naoko married [X] in indonesia in 1962 and converted to [Y] and [X] gave her the indonesian name ratna sari dewi [X]; derived from javanese-sanskrit which means "the jewel essence of a goddess".

1945–1949: aceh played an important role in the revolution and war of independence against the dutch and consequently was allegedly able to extract a promise from then-president [X] during his 1947 visit to aceh that it would be allowed to implement [Y]ic law (or syariah) following independence.

declaration of martial law in 1957 and establishment of guided democracy by [X] in 1959 proved to be a turning point for darul [Y]'s fortunes.

when [X], future president of indonesia, moved to bandung, he gradually alienated from his first political mentor and father in law tjokroaminoto (leader of the sarekat [Y]).

died: sekarmadji maridjan kartosuwirjo, 57, indonesian [Y]ic mystic and leader of the darul [Y] rebellion against the [X] regime, was executed by a firing squad

 published in sastra magazine under the pen name kipandjikusmin in august 1968, it tells the story of muhammad descending to earth with the angel gabriel to investigate the decreasing number of muslims entering heaven, only to find that muslims in indonesia have begun fornicating, drinking alcohol, waging war on muslims, and otherwise going against the tenets of [Y] because of nasakom, a government policy during [X]'s administration that combined nationalism, religion, and communism.

 most of his writings can be categorised into general points, namely: his position from a defender to opponent of the pancasila, [Y]ic democracy verses [X]'s java-centricness, [Y] versus other ideologies like the pancasila and communism, and his changing conception of state – from an [Y]ic federation to that of a caliphate system.

members of darul [Y] had tried several times to assassinate [X].

 in the 1960s huwae converted from catholicism to [Y], later going on the hajj with [X]'s wife dewi [X].

on the physical revolution, the second son of the national hero oemar said tjokroaminoto and sister of siti oetari, the first wife of the first president of the republic of indonesia, [X] sits as a personal adviser to general soedirman and joined a guerrilla group with him, then became a member in the committee for the united states of indonesia to restore the unitary republic of indonesia, lead goodwill indonesian mission to the [Y]ic countries and became president of the youth congress of the [Y]ic world.

 to reduce tensions between the national and [Y]ic groups, [X] formed a committee of nine on 18 june 1945.

 over the course of the afternoon of 22 june, the nine men produced a preamble for the constitution that included [X]'s pancasila philosophy, but added the seven words in indonesian (dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat [Y] bagi pemeluknya)  that placed an obligation on muslims to abide by [Y]ic law.

 in the jakarta charter, the existence of the phrase "with the obligation to carry out [Y]ic law for its adherents" (which became known as the "seven words"), recognizes sharia law for muslims, this greatly differs from the formulation of pancasila which was put forward by [X] in his speech on 1 june 1945.

 on 9 july 1959, [X] issued a decree dissolving the assembly and  reinstating the original constitution, but without the seven words the [Y]ists wanted.

 [X] was invited by ranumihardjo to spoke about the vision of indonesia and the state of [Y]ic.

 in his speech, [X] affronted the [Y]ic leaders of masyumi, which [X] would later dissolve in 1960.

 although veneration of the dead is often considered blasphemy within [Y], there is strong javanese tradition of visiting "holy men" graves (such as the wali sanga), and tens of thousands of javanese muslims visit [X]'s grave each year in order to obtain his spiritual blessing.

 muljadi was well known to be hostile towards the communist party of indonesia and an ardent supporter of [X], to the point where he commented that if [X] had been born in 571 ad, he would have become an [Y]ic prophet.

 after his return to the indies, he became involved in the indonesian nationalist movement, at first in the sarekat [Y] party in 1927 and then [X]'s indonesian national party in 1929, eventually becaming its chairman in pekalongan.

 wibisono was willing to give significant concessions such as increasing president [X]'s power to do this, but he was sidelined and instead the party under the new leadership of prawoto mangkusasmito opted to form an united front with other [Y]ic parties.

age of gerombolan (indonesian: zaman gerombolan) or literally translates to age of hordes, were a term used for period of political instability and regional armed conflicts mainly between communists, [Y]ist, and secular nationalist in newly independent indonesia particularly during early liberal democracy period under [X].

  none of the jewish supreme court justices have practiced orthodox [Y] while on the court, although [X] was raised orthodox.

 there was apparently some question concerning the inclusion of ezekiel in the canon of scripture, since it is frequently at odds with the torah (the five "books of [X]" which are foundational to [Y]).

 according to rabbinic [Y] the torah was revealed by god to [X]; within it, jews find 613 mitzvot (commandments).

[Y]'s view is summed up by a biblical observation about the torah: in the beginning god clothes the naked (adam), and at the end god buries the dead ([X]).

various manuscripts place the birth of mary in the sixth, seventh, eighth or ninth month, with the oldest having the seventh; this was in keeping with both the [Y] of the period, which had similar seventh-month births for significant individuals such as samuel, isaac, and [X], as the sign of a miraculous or divine conception.

orthodox [Y] holds that halakha is the divine law as laid out in the torah (five books of [X]), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees, and customs combined.

 although orthodox [Y] acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding jewish law where the written torah itself is nonspecific, they did so only in accordance with regulations received by [X] on mount sinai (see ).

within [Y], there are a variety of religious movements, most of which emerged from rabbinic [Y], which holds that god revealed his laws and commandments to [X] on mount sinai in the form of both the written and oral torah.

 [Y] also universally recognizes the biblical covenant between god and the patriarch abraham as well as the additional aspects of the covenant revealed to [X], who is considered [Y]'s greatest prophet.

orthodox [Y] holds that both the written and oral torah were divinely revealed to [X] and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging.

  depending on one's merit, one joins one of the paradises: the first is made of glass and cedar and is for converts to [Y]; the second is of silver and cedar and is for penitents; the third is of silver and gold, gems and pearls, and is for the patriarchs, [X] and aaron, the israelites that left egypt and lived in the wilderness, and the kings of israel; the fourth is of rubies and olive wood and is for the holy and steadfast in faith; the fifth is like the third, except a river flows through it and its bed was woven by eve and angels, and it is for the messiah and elijah; and the sixth and seventh divisions are not described, except that they are respectively for those who died doing a pious act and for those who died from an illness in expiation for israel's sins.

[X] () is considered the most important prophet in [Y] and one of the most important prophets in christianity, islam, the druze faith, the baháʼí faith and other abrahamic religions.

 rabbinical [Y] calculated a lifespan of [X] corresponding to 1391–1271 bce; jerome suggested 1592 bce, and james ussher suggested 1571 bce as his birth year.

in strabo's writings of the history of [Y] as he understood it, he describes various stages in its development: from the first stage, including [X] and his direct heirs; to the final stage where "the temple of jerusalem continued to be surrounded by an aura of sanctity.

 despite his importance, [Y] stresses that [X] was a human being, and is therefore not to be worshipped.

 in the orthodox view, [X] received not only the torah, but also the revealed (written and oral) and the hidden (the `hokhmat nistar teachings, which gave [Y] the zohar of the rashbi, the torah of the ari haqadosh and all that is discussed in the heavenly yeshiva between the ramhal and his masters).

 in acts 7:39–43, 51–53, for example, the rejection of [X] by the jews who worshipped the golden calf is likened to the rejection of jesus by the jews that continued in traditional [Y].

 following a theory proposed by a contemporary biblical critic, freud believed that [X] was murdered in the wilderness, producing a collective sense of patricidal guilt that has been at the heart of [Y] ever since.

the defining doctrine of orthodox [Y] is the belief that the torah ("teaching" or "law"), both the written scripture of the pentateuch and the oral tradition explicating it, was revealed by god to [X] on mount sinai, and that it was transmitted faithfully from sinai in an unbroken chain ever since.

 within [Y] there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from rabbinic [Y], which holds that god revealed his laws and commandments to [X] on mount sinai in the form of both the written and oral torah; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups.

 abu dharr al-ghifari, a companion of [X], is credited by multiple authors as a principal antecedent of [Y]ic socialism.

the early muslims, led by the [Y]ic prophet [X], made extensive use of sieges during military campaigns.

 it holds that the [Y]ic prophet [X] designated ali ibn abi talib as his successor and the imam (spiritual and political leader) after him, most notably at the event of ghadir khumm, but was prevented from succeeding [X] as the leader of the muslims as a result of the choice made by some of [X]'s other companions at saqifah.

 this view primarily contrasts with that of sunni [Y], whose adherents believe that [X] did not appoint a successor before his death and consider abu bakr, who was appointed caliph by a group of senior muslims at saqifah, to be the first rightful caliph after [X].

shia [Y] is based on a hadith concerning [X]'s pronouncement at ghadir khumm.

 shia believe ali should have been the successor to [X] as [Y]'s spiritual and political leader.

 muslims believe that [X] and other prophets in [Y] possessed ismah.

 shias regard ali as the successor of [X] not only ruling over the community in justice, but also interpreting [Y]ic practices and its esoteric meaning.

 according to the twelver shia, the main goal of mahdi will be to establish an [Y]ic state and to apply [Y]ic laws that were revealed to [X].

according to twelvers, defining and interpretation of [Y]ic jurisprudence is the responsibility of [X] and the twelve imams.

 in other words, twelver clerics provide guardianship of the [Y]ic jurisprudence, which was defined by [X] and his twelve successors.

 they believe god chose ali to be [X]'s successor, infallible, the first caliph (khalifah, head of state) of [Y].

during the revelation of ash-shu'ara, the twenty-sixth surah of the quran, in  617, [X] is said to have received instructions to warn his family members against adhering to their pre-[Y]ic religious practices.

 maclean, a link between sindh and shias or proto-shias can be traced to hakim ibn jabalah al-abdi, a companion of the [Y]ic prophet [X], who traveled across sind to makran in the year 649ad and presented a report on the area to the caliph.

this difference between following either the ahl al-bayt ([X]'s family and descendants) or caliph abu bakr has shaped shia and non-shia views on some of the quranic verses, the hadith (narrations from [X]) and other areas of [Y].

 the members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the muslims and the crusaders, but raynald ignored this and insulted the [Y]ic prophet, [X], before murdering and torturing a number of them.

 in the early 7th century, the [Y]ic prophet [X] united the population of arabia and created a single [Y]ic religious polity.

[X], the prophet of [Y], was born in mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, before migrating to medina in 622.

 the masjid al-haram (the grand mosque) in mecca is the location of the kaaba, [Y]'s holiest site, and the masjid al-nabawi (the prophet's mosque) in medina is the location of [X]'s tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, mecca and medina became pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of muslims from across the muslim world.

 the al ash-sheikh are the descendants of [X] ibn abd al-wahhab, the 18th century founder of the wahhabi form of sunni [Y] which is today dominant in saudi arabia.

 bin laden interpreted the [Y]ic prophet, [X] as banning the "permanent presence of infidels in arabia".

 the [Y]ic holidays of eid al-fitr, eid al-adha and maulid-un-nabi (birthday of the [Y]ic prophet [X]) are observed as national holidays in sierra leone.

 sheikh [X] taha jalloh is the president of the sierra leone supreme [Y]ic council.

[Y] entered the region very early on, as a group of persecuted muslims had sought refuge across the red sea in the horn of africa at the urging of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

 [X] ahmad ibn abd allah, the mahdi (guided one), offered to the ansars (his followers) and those who surrendered to him a choice between adopting [Y] or being killed.

the concept of the sun in pre-[Y]ic arabia, was abolished only under [X].

 isma'īl then grew up at mecca (in today's saudi arabia) and from which his descendants are the adnanite arabs (from the [Y]ic patriarch and ancestor adnan) - who is then one of the ancestors directly linked to the [Y]ic prophet [X].

the season fourteen episodes "200" and "201" were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the [Y]ic prophet, [X].

 the list: al-qaida/[Y]ic army, abu sayyaf group, armed [Y]ic group (gia), harakat ul-mujahidin (hum), al-jihad (egyptian [Y]ic jihad), [Y]ic movement of uzbekistan (imu), asbat al-ansar, salafist group for call and combat (gspc), libyan [Y]ic fighting group, al-itihaad al-[Y]iya (aiai), [Y]ic army of aden, osama bin laden, [X] atif (aka, subhi abu sitta, abu hafs al masri) sayf al-adl, shaykh sai'id (aka, mustafa [X] ahmad), abu hafs the mauritanian (aka, mahfouz ould al-walid, khalid al-shanqiti), ibn al-shaykh al-libi, abu zubaydah (aka, zayn al-abidin [X] husayn, tariq), abd al-hadi al-iraqi (aka, abu abdallah), ayman al-zawahiri, thirwat salah shihata, tariq anwar al-sayyid ahmad (aka, fathi, amr al-fatih), [X] salah (aka, nasr fahmi nasr hasanayn), makhtab al-khidamat/al kifah, wafa humanitarian organization, al rashid trust, mamoun darkazanli import-export company.

 classical sufi texts, which stressed certain teachings and practices of the quran and the sunnah (exemplary teachings and practices of the [Y]ic prophet [X]), gave definitions of tasawwuf that described ethical and spiritual goals and functioned as teaching tools for their attainment.

 brown notes that during the lifetime of [X], some companions were more inclined than others to "intensive devotion, pious abstemiousness and pondering the divine mysteries" more than [Y] required, such as abu dharr al-ghifari.

 ) – congregations formed around a grand master  who will trace their teaching through a chain of successive teachers back to the [Y]ic prophet [X].

according to ibn arabi, [Y] is the best religion because of [X].

 in this view, [Y] is the best religion because [X] is [Y].

 one of the outstanding pieces in the brooklyn museum's [Y]ic gallery has been the museum's associate curator of [Y]ic art, is a large 19th- or early-20th-century portrayal of the battle of karbala painted by abbas al-musavi, which was a violent episode in the disagreement between the sunni and shia branches of [Y]; during this battle, husayn ibn ali, a pious grandson of the [Y]ic prophet [X], died and is considered a martyr in [Y].

 to accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in judaism the torah, in christianity there is christ, for buddhism, buddha, and in [Y], [X].

al-khatib al-baghdadi, an 11th-century [Y]ic scholar, referenced a statement by the companion of [X], jabir ibn abd-allah:

[Y]: the [Y]ic society of central new york mosque is located on comstock avenue and [X]'s study group on west kennedy street.

the hadith (sayings of the [Y]ic prophet [X]) and the bible indicated that jesus would return during the latter days.

 [Y]ic tradition commonly depicts that jesus, upon his second coming, would be an ummati (muslim) and a follower of [X] and that he would revive the truth of [Y] rather than fostering a new religion.

the publication of the satanic verses in september 1988 caused immediate controversy in the [Y]ic world because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depiction of [X].

in response to the protests, on 22 january 1989 rushdie published a column in the observer that called [X] "one of the great geniuses of world history," but noted that [Y]ic doctrine holds [X] to be human, and in no way perfect.

 other books written by him include a biography of the [Y]ic prophet [X] titled "first and the last", while his other books are focused more on the relation between [Y] and science like miraculous quran, life after death and doomsday, and kitab-e-zindagi (in urdu).

according to the traditional muslim view, the major precepts of sharia were passed down directly from the [Y]ic prophet [X] without "historical development," and the emergence of [Y]ic jurisprudence (fiqh) also goes back to the lifetime of [X].

 820 ce/204 ah), who formulated this idea (that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources) and other elements of classical legal theory in his work al-risala, but who was preceded by a body of [Y]ic law not based on primacy of [X]'s hadiths.

the most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the egyptian [Y]ic scholar [X] ʿabduh (1849–1905).

 the liberal [Y]ic view is influenced by [X] abduh's emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion.

in classical fiqh, blasphemy refers to any form of cursing, questioning or annoying god, [X] or anything considered sacred in [Y],r ibrahim (2013), crucified again, , pp.

] constitute[s] a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by [Y]", while [X] sayyid tantawy, grand imam of al-azhar and former grand mufti of egypt has stated that "attacking innocent people is not courageous; it is stupid and will be punished on the day of judgment".

rape is considered a serious crime in the sharia law since the [Y]ic prophet [X] ordered rapists to be punished by stoning.

in [Y], sunnah (, ) are the traditions and practices of the [Y]ic prophet, [X], that constitute a model for muslims to follow.

 according to classical [Y]ic theories, the sunnah are documented by hadith (the verbally transmitted record of the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions or disapprovals of [X]), and along with the quran (the book of [Y]), are the divine revelation (wahy) delivered through [X] that make up the primary sources of [Y]ic law and belief/theology.

 differing from sunni classical [Y]ic theories are those of shia muslims, who hold that the twelve imams interpret the sunnah, and sufi who hold that [X] transmitted the values of sunnah "through a series of sufi teachers.

 during the early [Y]ic period, the term referred to any good precedent set by people of the past, including both [X], and his companions.

the classical meaning that now prevails was introduced later in the late second century of [Y], when under the influence of the scholar al-shafi‘i, [X]'s example as recorded in hadith was given priority over all other precedents set by other authorities.

"the actions and sayings of the prophet [X]" (oxford [Y]ic studies online).

 the path, the methodology and the way of [X]; and to "adhering to [Y] in the manner prescribed, without adding to it or introducing innovations into the religion", which hadith does not; fuqaha' scholars use the word "sunnah" when explaining the ruling on doing a specific action as being mustahabb (liked or encouraged), which they do not with hadith).

 according to seyyed nasr, the hadith contains the words of [X], while the sunnah contains his words and actions along with pre-[Y]ic practices of which he approved.

 christians, jews and the arab descendants of ishmael, the arabized arabs or ishmaelites, when [X] reinstituted this practice as an integral part of [Y].

the tradition which not directly sourced from hadith or practice of [X] and instead traced to solely some sahabah were also acknowledged as one of the source of jurisprudence, as it was regarded by scholars of [Y] such as nawawi as "unrecorded hadith" which not explicitly attributed to [X] himself but clearly practiced by the first generation of [X]'s follower.

 brown), the classical [Y]ic definition of sunnah as the customs and practices of [X] (only) was not the original one.

in al-Ṭabarī's history of early [Y], the term "sunnah of the prophet" is not only used "surprisingly infrequently", but used to refer to "political oaths or slogans used by rebels", or "a general standard of justice and right conduct", and not "to specific precedents set by [X]", let alone hadith.

 schools of fiqh in the second century of [Y], limited sunnah to "traditions traced back to the prophet [X] himself" (sunna al-nabawiyyah).

[Y] jurists divide sunnah into that which has no legal consequences --al-sunna al-ʿādīyah -- (the "personal habits and preferences" of [X]); and that which is binding on muslims -- al-sunna al-hudā.

 to them [X]'s attitude, his piety, the quality of his character constitute the truer and deeper aspect of what it means by sunnah in [Y], rather than the external aspects alone.

the primary collections of sunnah of shia [Y] were written by three authors known as the 'three [X]s', and they are:

[X] ali jinnah claimed that the pakistan movement started when the first muslim put his foot on the soil of sindh, which he labelled the "gateway of [Y]" in india.

in 712, [X] bin qasim conquered the sindh and indus valley, bringing south asian societies into contact with [Y].

[Y] in sindh has a long history, starting with the capture of sindh by [X] bin qasim in 712 ce.

early [Y]ic historians like ibn ishaq and ibn hisham always included shem's name in the genealogy of [X].

 it was later popularized by pan-[Y]ic scholars such as [X] rashid rida in his treatise as-sunna wa-š-šiʿa au al-wahhābīya wa-r-rāfiḍa: Ḥaqāʾiq dīnīya taʾrīḫīya iǧtimaʿīya iṣlaḥīya ("the sunna and the shia, or wahhabism and rāfidism: religious history, sociological und reformoriented facts“) published in 1928-29 c.

one common mistake is to assume that sunni [Y] represents a normative [Y] that emerged during the period after [X]'s death, and that sufism and shi'ism developed out of sunni [Y].

sunnis believe the companions of [X] to be reliable transmitters of [Y], since god and [X] accepted their integrity.

 syrian-albanian athari theologian [X] nasir al-din al-albani rejected extremism in excluding ash'aris from sunni [Y].

the quran as it exists today in book form was compiled by [X]'s companions (sahabah) within a handful of months of his death, and is accepted by all sects of [Y].

 later generations sought out oral traditions regarding the early history of [Y], and the practices of [X] and his first followers, and wrote them down so that they might be preserved.

 according to ibn 'umar, [X] said that [Y] is based on the following five principles:

the palace of the lions is one of the most famous palaces in [Y]ic architecture and exemplifies the apogee of nasrid architecture under the reign of [X] v.

 however, a few shiite [Y]ists supported taliban rule, such as ustad [X] akbari.

 followers of shia [Y], however, believe a caliph should be an imam chosen by god from the ahl al-bayt (the "family of the house", [X]'s direct descendants).

gold: faruqi "فاروقی" for the pagoda (umar al-faruq, the second caliph) – sadîqi "صدیقی" for the double-pagoda (abu bakr al-sadiq, the first caliph) – ahmadi "احمدی" for the four-pagoda ( "most praised ", one of the name of the [Y]ic prophet [X]).

 the latter is described in the ahadith and the kitab al miraj (translated into latin in 1264 or shortly before as liber scalae machometi, "the book of [X]'s ladder"), and has significant similarities to the paradiso, such as a sevenfold division of paradise, although this is not unique to the kitab al miraj or [Y]ic cosmology.

" his presentation of [X]'s life again reflected his anti-[Y]ic views: "in his private conduct, mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet.

the arrival of envoys from the prophet [X] in 632 heralded the conversion of the region to [Y].

 during this period, cities such as samarkand, khiva, and bukhara began to grow rich from the silk road, and witnessed the emergence of leading figures of the [Y]ic golden age, including [X] al-bukhari, al-tirmidhi, al khwarizmi, al-biruni, avicenna and omar khayyam.

the [Y]ic prophet [X] described zodiacal light in reference to the timing of the five daily prayers, calling it the "false dawn" ( ).

 practitioners of [Y] use [X]'s descriptions of zodiacal light to avoid errors in determining the timing of daily prayers.

 one example of this was a legend that husayn, son of the fourth caliph ali and grandson of [Y]'s prophet [X], had married a captive sassanid princess named shahrbanu.

during the 2005 presidential election, khamenei's comments about importance of fighting corruption, being faithful to the ideals of the [Y]ic revolution, as well as on the superior intelligence and dynamism of those who studied engineering, were interpreted by some as a subtle endorsement of mahmoud [X]inejad (who had a phd in traffic engineering).

mirzā ghulām [X] (13 february 1835 – 26 may 1908) was an indian religious leader and the founder of the [X]iyya movement in [Y].

born in 1835 to a rais family in qadian, ghulam [X] emerged as a writer and debater for [Y].

 as opposed to the christian and mainstream [Y]ic view of jesus (or isa), being alive in heaven to return towards the end of time, ghulam [X] asserted that he had in fact survived crucifixion and died a natural death.

although ghulam [X] is revered by [X]i muslims as the promised messiah and imām mahdi, muhammad nevertheless remains the central figure in [X]iyya [Y].

 ghulam [X]'s claim to be a subordinate (ummati) prophet within [Y] has remained a central point of controversy between his followers and mainstream muslims, who believe muhammad to be the last prophet.

in 1886, certain leaders of the arya samaj held discussion and debate with ghulam [X] about the truthfulness of [Y] and asked for a sign to prove that [Y] was a living religion.

 in one of his most well-known and praised works, barahin-e-[X]iyya, a voluminous work, he claimed to be the messiah of [Y].

 mirza ghulam [X] wrote two books named "tuhfa e qaisariah" and "sitara e qaisaria" in which he invited queen victoria to embrace [Y] and forsake christianity.

upon this, there was a clamour among the crowds, and mirza ghulam [X] was informed that the other party alleged that he was at odds with [Y]ic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs.

 furthermore, some [Y]ic scholars have opined that jesus has died (ghulam [X]'s assertion) or have expressed their own confusion on this matter, though the majority orthodox position of most muslims with regard to this issue has not changed.

 the [X]iyya muslim community, which comprises by far the majority of [X]is, believes that ghulam [X]'s prophetic status does not in any way infringe the finality of muhammad's prophethood – to which it is wholly subservient and from which it is inseparable – and is in accordance with scriptural prophecies concerning the advent of the messiah in [Y].

the movement initiated by ghulam [X] – which is often seen to have emerged as an [Y]ic religious response to the christian and arya samaj missionary activity widespread in 19th century india, and is viewed by its adherents as embodying the promised latter day revival of [Y] – has, since its establishment, grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme under the leadership of its caliphate.

some [Y]ic traditions view the name [X] as another given name of muhammad at birth by his mother, considered by muslims to be the more esoteric name of muhammad and central to understanding his nature.

traditional [Y]ic sources, such as sahih al-bukhari, sahih muslim, and others contain hadith in which muhammad personally refers to himself as [X].

 [Y]ic scholars such as william montgomery watt, however, argue that the use of [X] as a proper name for muhammad did not exist until well into the second [Y]ic century, previously being used only in an adjectival sense.

after the first round of the election, some people, including mehdi karroubi, the pragmatic reformist candidate who ranked third in the first round but was the first when partial results were first published, have alleged that a network of mosques, the [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps military forces, and basij militia forces have been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for [X]inejad.

 this despite that region's large numbers of disgruntled sunni muslims, and [X]inejad's association with "intrusive shia [Y]ism.

also, some political groups, including the reformist party [Y]ic iran participation front, have alleged that [X]inejad had only ranked second because of the illegal support and advertising activities for him during the voting by the supervisors selected by the guardian council, while the supervisors should have remained impartisan according to the election law.

 also, the reformist newspaper shargh has pointed to an announcement by movahhedi kermani, the official representative of the supreme leader in [Y]ic revolutionary guards corps, mentioning "vote for a person who keeps to the minimum in his advertisements and doesn't lavish", which uniquely pointed to [X]inejad.

[X]iyya [Y] considers jesus (ʿĪsā) as a human mortal man and prophet of god, born to the virgin mary (maryam).

 in [X]iyya [Y], jesus is thought to have died a natural death in india.

although sharing many similarities with the other [Y]ic views of jesus, the [X]iyya teachings are distinct from the beliefs held by most mainstream muslims, who deny the crucifixion of jesus and believe that he ascended bodily to heaven, and will, according to [Y]ic literary sources, return before the end of time.

[X]i scholars regard the contemporary [Y]ic interpretations relating to the second coming of jesus (see [X]i prophetology) are inaccurate.

 walter, like later scholars, identified the [Y]ic version of the barlaam and josaphat story as the primary of [X]'s evidence despite the fact that the four chapters of his book are arranged around evidence from the gospels, the quran and hadith, medical literature and historical records – respectively.

to illustrate the death of jesus, [X]iyya scholars use references to various [Y]ic hadith.

the encyclopedia of [Y] states that the post-crucifixion journey of jesus towards the east and his natural death as an aspect of [X]i belief is one of three primary tenets that distinguish [X]i teachings from general [Y]ic ones, and that it has provoked a fatwa against the movement.

the [X]iyya understanding of the term khatam an-nabiyyin (seal of prophets) with reference to muhammad, establishes that a prophet cannot come after muhammad from outside the [Y]ic dispensation.

thus [X]is regard that, as ghulam [X] was only a follower and reviver of the original [Y]ic faith, his claim of being a subordinate prophet (in the likeness of jesus being a subordinate prophet) does not in any way violate the seal of prophets (muhammed).

 in particular, contemporary [Y]ic scholars view the [X]iyya belief as a contradiction with the verse in the quran, chapter 33 (the combined forces), verse 40:

in 1894, ghulam [X] had declared that the contemporary [Y]ists views of jihad of the sword and holy war was a fundamental misrepresentation of [Y], that was invented during the dark ages.

the [X]iyya movement believe that any military jihad in [Y] is permitted only and exclusively for the defence of religious freedom and in very strictly defined circumstances (not exclusive only to [Y]).

 [X]is believe that in the modern era, the "jihad of the pen" (peaceful intellectual reasoning) is the only potent way of espousing and spreading the [Y]ic teaching.

the lahore [X]iyya movement for the propagation of [Y], () is a separatist group within the [X]iyya movement that formed in 1914 as a result of ideological and administrative differences following the demise of hakim nur-ud-din, the first caliph after mirza ghulam [X].

adopting a position more congruent with the mainstream of sunni [Y] regarding the issues of dispute, muhammad ali led the lahore [X]iyya movement as amīr (president) from 1914 until his death in 1951.

 notwithstanding, the group was subsumed within pakistan's anti-[X]i laws declaring [X]is to be non-muslims and prohibiting them from any public expression of the [Y]ic faith.

 muhammad ali held that the type of prophecy described by ghulam [X] in reference to himself did not make him a prophet in the technical sense of the word as used in [Y]ic terminology, amounted to nothing more than sainthood (walāya) and that [Y]ic mystics preceding ghulam [X] had similarly described experiences of prophecy within [Y] in the context of their relationship with muhammad.

in contrast, mahmud [X] posited that ghulam [X]'s messianic claim and role were qualitatively distinct to the claims of the saints preceding him in [Y] and that his prophetic status, though completely subservient to muhammad, being a mere reflection of his own prophethood and not legislating anything new, still made him technically a prophet irrespective of the type of prophethood or the adjectives added to qualify it.

 that which subsists outside of [Y] in contrast to that which does not entail exclusion from it, although mahmud [X] held that muslims who did not accept ghulam [X] technically fell into the category of disbelief, and that rejection of him ultimately amounted to rejection of muhammad, he utilised the broad connotations and usages of the arabic word kafir to stress that his use of the term in reference to such muslims did not carry its demotic meaning, but rather meant to signify doctrinal deviancy and to express that only [X]is were true muslims.

 he held, therefore, that non-[X]i muslims were to be classified as disbelievers albeit within the remit of [Y] and not in the sense that they had a religion other than [Y]; and, further, that the movement passed no judgement as to their fate in the hereafter and never proactively expressed this opinion of them.

 although he refused demands from outside the movement to accept that the term kafir did not apply to non-[X]i muslims, mahmud [X] did maintain that such muslims were not deemed to be outside the pale of [Y].

towards the end of 1905, mirza ghulam [X] published a short treatise anticipating his own death entitled al-wasiyyat (or the will) in which he established the sadr anjuman [X]iyya (central [X]iyya council), an executive body set up to administer the movement and to collect and distribute funds to support the propagation of [Y].

there are 5 mosques that follow the principles taught by the [X]iyya anjuman ishaat-i-[Y] lahore in trinidad and tobago.

 [X]is claim the [X]iyya movement to embody the latter day revival of [Y] and the movement has also been seen to have emerged as an [Y]ic religious response to the christian and arya samaj missionary activity that was widespread in 19th century india.

 the movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to ghulam [X]'s claim to be a prophet within [Y].

 it is believed by [X]is to be the re-establishment of the rashidun caliphate that commenced following the death of the [Y]ic prophet muhammad.

 in 1984, ordinance xx was promulgated by the government of pakistan which prohibited [X]i muslims from any public expression of the [Y]ic faith, rendering the caliph unable to perform his duties as the leader of the community.

since the [X]iyya is widely viewed as a heterodox movement by the mainstream of sunni and shi'ite [Y], most muslims outside the movement do not recognise [X]i claims to a caliphate as valid.

 in terms of the political aspect of the caliphate as envisioned within the [X]iyya community, since god's sovereignty is seen as extending over the universe, the ideal polity within [Y] is one where the caliph is the spiritual head guiding, in accordance with [Y]ic principles, a federation or confederation of autonomous states (functioning under any political system or form of government) associated together for the maintenance of peace and cooperating in promoting human welfare throughout the world.

 however, the [X]iyya caliphate is seen as a continuation of the first [Y]ic caliphate of muhammad and the [X]iyya caliphs as successors to ghulam [X] as well as ultimately to muhammad.

the ulema (scholars of [Y]) are also in agreement (according to hafiz muhammad azeem citing [X] hassan's "the theory of naskh") "that rational matters and moral truths such as the virtue of doing justice or being good to one's parents, are not changeable and are therefore not open to abrogation".

another report used to support naskh al-tilāwa dūna al-hukm — where aisha states that a quranic verse requiring only five suckling of a child to establish foster-parentship was abrogated but which later became the basis of a certain  rule in [Y]ic law — is argued against by [X] hasan  on the grounds that rule was rejected by "the ancient schools of [[Y]ic] law".

a wide variety of [Y]ic scholars — syed [X] khan, muhammad al-munajjid, hafiz muhammad azeem — also states that naskh applies "between religions", i.

 in addition some non-mainstream sects of [Y] — such as the mu'tazili, zaidiyah, and quranists, and more recently the [X]iyya — have rejected naskh on the rationalist grounds that the word of god can not contain contradictions.

 in writing the book, ghulam [X] sought to rejuvenate [Y] by arguing for the validity of its principles and vindicating its teachings in response to christian and hindu polemics against [Y] as well as atheistic philosophies.

the work was initially intended to be a fifty-volume series in the defence of [Y], however, ghulam [X]'s claim to be divinely appointed as the expected mahdi and messiah during the course of its writing and following the publication of volume four marked a major turning point in his life.

 the barāhīn proved to be a useful source for the defence of [Y]ic doctrine and was critically acclaimed by many indian muslim scholars at the time, earning ghulam [X] recognition as an expert in formulating arguments against christians and hindus among the intellectual circles of the punjab.

 [X]ans, an [Y]ic order

the [Y]ic c[X]phate's defeats of the byzantine and persian empires led to west asia and southern parts of central asia and western parts of south asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century.

 the country is currently under the control of the t[X]ban, an [Y]ist political movement which returned to power in 2021 after a 20-year-long war with the united states and its allies.

 the t[X]ban emerged in september 1994 as a movement and militia of students (t[X]b) from [Y]ic madrassas (schools) in pakistan, who soon had military support from pakistan.

 the t[X]ban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of [Y]ic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many afghans, especially women.

 as of 16 august 2021, an unofficial coordination council led by senior statesmen was in the process of coordinating the transfer of the state institutions of the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan to the t[X]ban.

 on 17 august, the first vice president of the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan, amrullah saleh, proclaimed himself the caretaker president of afghanistan and announced the formation of an anti-t[X]ban front with a reported 6,000+ troops in the panjshir valley, along with ahmad massoud.

on 17 august 2021, the leader of the t[X]ban-affiliated hezb-e-[Y]i gulbuddin party, gulbuddin hekmatyar, met with both hamid karzai, the former president of afghanistan, and abdullah abdullah, the chairman of the high council for national reconciliation and former chief executive, in doha, qatar, with the aim of forming a government (though it is unclear whether either karzai or abdullah will be directly involved in any such government).

, the [Y]ic emirate is undergoing a transitional political period with an unofficial coordination council led by senior statesmen in the process of coordinating the transfer of the state institutions of the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan to the t[X]ban.

 under the previous [Y]ic republic of afghanistan, it enjoyed cordial relations with a number of nato and allied nations, particularly the united states, canada, united kingdom, germany, austr[X]a, and turkey.

the [Y]ic emirate army captured a large amount of weapons, hardware, vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the afghan armed forces following the 2021 t[X]ban offensive and the fall of kabul.

in the pre-[Y]ic zabad inscription, god is referred to by the term , that is, [X]f-lam-[X]f-lam-ha.

in late pre-[Y]ic times, a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the hejaz which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the hijra, most strongly in judeo-christian texts, keeping [X]ve ancient features eliminated from the "learned" tradition (classical arabic).

classical arabic is the language found in the quran, used from the period of pre-[Y]ic arabia to that of the abbasid c[X]phate.

 an original  lenited to , and  – consistently attested in pre-[Y]ic greek transcription of arabic languages – became palat[X]zed to  or  by the time of the quran and , ,  or  after early muslim conquests and in msa (see arabic phonology#local variations for more detail).

ibn sina (), also known as abu [X] sina (), pour sina (), and often known in the west as avicenna (;  – june 1037), was a persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, astronomers, thinkers and writers of the [Y]ic golden age, and the father of early modern medicine.

 the search for a definitive [Y]ic philosophy separate from occasion[X]sm can be seen in what is left of his work.

avicenna's theology on metaphysical issues (ilāhiyyāt) has been criticized by some [Y]ic scholars, among them al-ghaz[X], ibn taymiyya and ibn al-qayyim.

 avicenna wrote a number of short treatises de[X]ng with [Y]ic theology.

robert wisnovsky, a scholar of avicenna attached to the mcgill university, says that "avicenna was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in [Y], particularly in the fields of metaphysics, logic and medicine" but that his works didn't only have an influence in these "secular" fields of knowledge alone, as "these works, or portions of them, were read, taught, copied, commented upon, quoted, paraphrased and cited by thousands of post-avicennian scholars—not only philosophers, logicians, physicians and speci[X]sts in the mathematical or exact sciences, but also by those who speci[X]zed in the disciplines of ʿilm al-kalām (rational theology, but understood to include natural philosophy, epistemology and philosophy of mind) and usūl al-fiqh (jurisprudence, but understood to include philosophy of law, dialectic, and philosophy of language).

 he believed that this aeon follows on from the aeon of osiris, in which patern[X]stic religions like christianity, [Y], and buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the aeon of isis, which had been matern[X]stic and dominated by goddess worship.

 after the fall of the soviet union, ak-47s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash, including drug cartels and dictatorial states, and more recently they have been seen in the hands of [Y]ic groups such as al-qaeda, isil, and the t[X]ban in afghanistan and iraq, and farc, ejército de liberación nacional guerrillas in colombia.

2021 – kabul falls into the hands of the t[X]ban as ashraf ghani flees afghanistan along with local residents and foreign nationals, effectively reestablishing the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 because of this, hasan [X] shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the ismaili form of [Y].

 the aga khan himself can be considered an [Y]ic modernist and an intellectual of the [X]garh movement.

like many other [Y]ic modernists, the aga khan held a low opinion of the traditional religious establishment (the ʿulamāʾ) as well as what he saw as their rigid form[X]sm, leg[X]sm, and liter[X]sm.

 he endorsed the spiritual equ[X]ty of men and women in [Y], and he also called for full political equ[X]ty.

 ibn zallu sent his student abdallah ibn yasin to preach m[X]kite [Y] to the sanhaja berbers of the adrar (present-day mauritania).

 they then came in contact with the barghawata, a berber tribal confederation, who followed an [Y]ic "heresy" preached by s[X]h ibn tarif three centuries earlier.

the almoravid movement started as a conservative [Y]ic reform movement inspired by the m[X]ki school of jurisprudence.

 bennison also challenges robert hillenbrand's characterization of the art of al-andalus and the maghreb as provincial and peripheral in consideration of [Y]ic art globally, and of the contributions of the almoravids as "sparse" as a result of the empire's "puritanical fervour" and "ephemer[X]ty.

at first, the almoravids, subscribing to the conservative m[X]ki school of [Y]ic jurisprudence, rejected what they perceived as decadence and a lack of piety among the iberian muslims of the andalusi taifa kingdoms.

 as for the foremost one in the matter of [Y] and faith, it was [X] ibn abi t[X]b.

 [X] ibn abi t[X]b was the first child to embrace [Y], for he has not even reached the age of puberty at that time, while abu bakr was the first free man to embrace [Y].

the naqshbandiyya: orthodoxy and activism in a worldwide sufi tradition by itzchak weismann, 2007, p24[Y]ic sufism by sirdar ikbal [X] shah, tractus books, 2000, p104 the shia imams jafar al-sadiq, musa al-kazim, [X] al-reza, muhammad al-jawad, [X] al-hadi, hasan al-askari and muhammad al-mahdi are all descended from abu bakr.

abu bakr had the distinction of being the first c[X]ph in the history of [Y] and also the first c[X]ph to nominate a successor.

 he was the only c[X]ph in the history of [Y] who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his c[X]phate.

 however, as sayed [X] asgher razwy notes in his book a restatement of the history of [Y] & muslims, muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep.

al qaeda aims to establish an [Y]ic state in the arab world, modelled after the rashidun c[X]phate, by initiating a global jihad against the "international jewish-crusader alliance" led by the united states, which it sees as the "external enemy" and against the secular governments in muslim countries, that are described as "the apostate domestic enemy".

following its 9/11 attack and in response to its condemnation by [Y]ic scholars, al-qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, "a statement from qaidat al-jihad regarding the mandates of the heroes and the leg[X]ty of the operations in new york and washington".

 ret[X]ation for the american war on [Y] which al-qaeda alleges has targeted "muslim women, children and elderly";

 the t[X]ban also garnered support from graduates of [Y]ic schools, which are called madrassa.

the continuing lawlessness enabled the growing and well-disciplined t[X]ban to expand their control over territory in afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 while not officially working together, al-qaeda enjoyed the t[X]ban's protection and supported the regime in such a strong symbiotic relationship that many western observers dubbed the t[X]ban's [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan as, "the world's first terrorist-sponsored state.

neither bin laden nor al-zawahiri possessed the traditional [Y]ic scholarly qu[X]fications to issue a fatwa.

in february 2014, after a prolonged dispute with al-qaeda in iraq's successor organisation, the [Y]ic state of iraq and the levant (isis), al-qaeda publicly announced it was cutting all ties with the group, reportedly for its brut[X]ty and "notorious intractability".

in september 2021, after the success of 2021 t[X]ban offensive, al-qaeda congratulated t[X]ban and called for liberation of kashmir from the “clutches of the enemies of [Y]".

 two fatwas are said to have been appointed by al-qaeda's members, mamdouh mahmud s[X]m, to justify the killings according to [Y]ic law.

by the end of 2004, the us government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the cia: abu zubaydah, ramzi bin al-shibh and abd al-rahim al-nashiri in 2002; kh[X]d sheikh mohammed in 2003; and saif al [Y] el masry in 2004.

in mid-2014 after the [Y]ic state of iraq and the levant declared that they had restored the c[X]phate, an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group abu muhammad al-adnani claiming that "the leg[X]ty of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the c[X]phate's authority.

 [Y]ic military counter terrorism co[X]tion

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm in the united states

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm

 during the twentieth century, some african americans converted to [Y], mainly through the influence of black nation[X]st groups that preached with distinctive [Y]ic practices; including the moorish science temple of america, and the largest organization, the nation of [Y], founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963.

following the rise of the t[X]ban in 1996, massoud, who rejected the t[X]ban's fundament[X]st interpretation of [Y], returned to armed opposition until he was forced to flee to kulob, tajikistan, strategically destroying the salang tunnel on his way north.

 while studying at the lycée massoud took interest in all things military, namely during the six-day war in which he became enamoured by egyptian president gamel abdel nasser's [Y]ic nation[X]sm and defiance.

 the director of the centre for arab and [Y]ic studies at the austr[X]an national university, amin saikal, writes in modern afghanistan: a history of struggle and survival that without pakistan's support, hekmatyar "would not have been able to target and destroy half of kabul.

 on the one side was the shia hazara hezb-i wahdat of abdul [X] mazari and on the other side, the sunni pashtun ittihad-i [Y]i of abdul rasul sayyaf.

 the ghaz[X] foundation enabled afghan artists to exhibit their works at different places in kabul, and numerous artists and authors were honoured for their works; some of them neither proponents of massoud nor the [Y]ic state government.

 in 1994, the t[X]ban (a movement originating from jamiat ulema-e-[Y]-run religious schools for afghan refugees in pakistan) also developed in afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.

hizb-i [Y]i had bombarded kabul from january 1994 until february 1995 when the t[X]ban expelled hizb from its charasiab headquarters, after which the t[X]ban relaunched the bombardment of kabul and started to besiege the town.

 the t[X]ban started shelling kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the [Y]ic state government under ahmad shah massoud.

 the t[X]ban's first major offensive against the important western city of herat, under the rule of [Y]ic state ally ismail khan, in february 1995 was defeated when massoud airlifted 2,000 of his own core forces from kabul to help defend herat.

 many pashtun areas under t[X]ban control had representatives also advocating for a peace agreement with the [Y]ic state government.

 the t[X]ban marched into kabul on september 27, 1996, and established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 he stated that the t[X]ban and al-qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of [Y]" and that without the support of pakistan and bin laden the t[X]ban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.

 she reported that massoud had conveyed warnings about strengthened ties between the t[X]ban and foreign [Y]ist terrorists.

 due to the actions of muhammad and the rightly guided c[X]phs, marriage between cousins is explicitly allowed in [Y] and the qur'an itself does not discourage or forbid the practice.

 antisemitism has increased greatly in the region since the beginning of the 20th century, for several reasons: the dissolution and breakdown of the ottoman empire and traditional [Y]ic society; european influence, brought about by western imperi[X]sm and arab christians; nazi propaganda and relations between nazi germany and the arab world; resentment over jewish nation[X]sm; the rise of arab nation[X]sm; and the widespread proliferation of anti-jewish and anti-zionist conspiracy theories.

by medieval standards, conditions for jews under [Y] were generally more form[X]zed and better than those of jews in christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with christians in these lands.

some scholars hold that arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting jewish and arab nation[X]sm, and was imported into the arab world primarily by nation[X]stically minded christian arabs (and only subsequently was it "[Y]ized"), mark cohen states.

george gruen attributes the increased animosity towards jews in the arab world to the defeat and breakdown of the ottoman empire and traditional [Y]ic society; domination by western colonial powers under which jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of arab nation[X]sm, whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local jews through government channels; resentment over jewish nation[X]sm and the zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular arab regimes to scapegoat local jews for political purposes.

in a video published in the summer of 2014, senior abu sayyaf leader isnilon hapilon and other masked men swore their allegiance or "bay'ah" to abu bakr al-baghdadi, the "[Y]ic state" (is) c[X]ph.

 the group was originally not thought to receive funding from outside sources, but intelligence reports from the united states, indonesia and austr[X]a found intermittent ties to the indonesian jemaah [Y]iyah terrorist group, and the philippine government considers the abu sayyaf to be part of jemaah [Y]iyah.

  some critics assert that the persecution of shias, sufis and non-muslims to impose practices of orthodox [Y]ic state, such as imposition of sharia and jizya religious tax on non-muslims, doubling of custom duties on hindus while abolishing it for muslims, executions of muslims and non-muslims [X]ke, and destruction of temples eventually led to numerous rebellions.

 the bnp's literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nation[X]st sentiment among the british population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed-race relationships, and who are promoting the [Y]ification of the country.

 in 2005 the party stated that its primary issue of concern was the "growth of fundament[X]st-militant [Y] in the uk and its ever-increasing threat to western civilization and our implicit values".

 british christianity, the bnp claimed, was under threat from [Y], marxism, multicultur[X]sm, and "political correctness".

 senior bnp figures nevertheless believed that these tabloids' hostile coverage of immigration and [Y] helped to legitimise and norm[X]se the party and its views among much of the british public, a view echoed by some academic observers.

 it suggested that such campaigns should avoid associating with the mainstream parties from which bnp voters felt disenfranchised and that they should not be afraid of calling out [Y]ic fundament[X]sts and extremists active in the area.

 ironically, despite what was being feared in moscow, the united states was not supporting the [Y]ic fundament[X]st rebellion in afghanistan, and only started to support the mujahideen ("warriors of allah") with weapons after the soviet invasion, concentrating foreign policy matters in the form of linkage towards preventing soviet expansion.

sikainiga writes that one rationale for concubinage in [Y] was that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immor[X]ty in the muslim community.

" most [Y]ic schools of thought restricted concubinage to a relationship where the female slave was required to be monogamous to her master, (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to sikainga, in re[X]ty this was not always practiced and female slaves were targeted by other men of the master's household.

 imported from arabia, and the wider [Y]ic world, the ad[X]tes led by ahmed ibn ibrahim al-ghazi were the first african power to introduce cannon warfare to the african continent.

" quoting the qur'anic statement, "let christians judge according to what we have revealed in the gospel", muhammad hamidullah writes that [Y] decentr[X]zed and "commun[X]zed" law and justice.

 marshall hodgson, a historian of [Y], writes that during the era of the high c[X]phate (7th–13th centuries), zealous shariah-minded muslims gladly elaborated their code of symbolic restrictions on the dhimmis.

because the early [Y]ic conquests initially preserved much of the existing administrative machinery and culture, in many territories they amounted to little more than a change of rulers for the subject populations, which "brought peace to peoples demor[X]zed and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of byzantine-persian warfare".

religious plur[X]sm existed in medieval [Y]ic law and ethics.

 the religious laws and courts of other religions, including christianity, judaism and hinduism, were usually accommodated within the [Y]ic legal framework, as exemplified in the c[X]phate, al-andalus, ottoman empire and indian subcontinent.

 however, western orient[X]sts doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no arabic and knew nothing of [Y] could draft such a document.

from 50 ah until the early second century ah there was competition between "a tradition[X]st approach to jurisprudence" in western arabia where [Y] was revealed and a "ration[X]st approach in iraq".

 but later as fate would have it (predestination in [Y]) when yazid i, an oppressive ruler took power, hussein ibn [X] the grandson of muhammad felt that it was a test from god for him and his duty to confront him.

  this is in part because of a "vacuum" in the other source of [Y]ic law, qada` (legal rulings by state appointed [Y]ic judges) after the fall of the last c[X]phate the ottoman empire.

starting on 16 october 2011 during operation linda nchi, kenyan air force f-5s supported the kenyan forces fighting in som[X]a against al shabab [Y]ists bombing targets inside som[X]a and spearheading the ground forces.

 during sadat's presidency, his wife, jehan sadat, publicly advocated further women's rights, though egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equ[X]ty with the new [Y]ist movement and growing conservatism.

 however, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [Y]ic feminism, which argues for women's equ[X]ty within an [Y]ic framework.

[Y]ic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equ[X]ty, and social justice grounded within an [Y]ic framework.

 advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equ[X]ty in the quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of [Y]ic teaching through the quran, hadith (sayings of muhammad), and sharia (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.

in [Y], flatulence, if audible or odorous, inv[X]dates wudu (ritual purity).

a fatwā (, also ; ; plural fatāwā ) is a legal ruling on a point of [Y]ic law (sharia)  given by a qu[X]fied jurist in response to a question posed by a private individual, judge or government.

 while in most of the [Y]ic world judges were not required to consult muftis by any political authority, in muslim spain this practice was mandatory, so that a judicial decision was considered inv[X]d without prior approval by a legal speci[X]st.

early in the era of western coloni[X]sm, several fatwas were issued drawing on the classical legal distinction between lands under [Y]ic rule (dar al-[Y]) and lands of war (dar al-harb) or unbelief (dar al-kufr).

 khomeini himself did not call this proclamation a fatwa, and some scholars have argued that it did not qu[X]fy as one, since in [Y]ic legal theory only a court can decide whether an accused is guilty.

 in addition to denouncing its content, many [Y]ic jurists stressed that bin laden was not qu[X]fied to either issue a fatwa or declare a jihad.

 in other cases, [Y]ic jurists of different nation[X]ties, schools of law, and sometimes even denominations (sunni and shia), coordinate to issue a joint fatwa, which is expected to command greater authority with the public than individual fatwas.

 since women now represent a significant proportion of students studying [Y]ic law and qu[X]fying as muftiyas, their prominence in its interpretation is likely to rise.

fundament[X]sm within [Y] goes back to the early history of [Y] in the 7th century, to the time of the kharijites.

the shia and sunni religious conflicts since the 7th century created an opening for radical ideologues, such as [X] shariati (1933–77), to merge social revolution with [Y]ic fundament[X]sm, as exemplified by the iranian revolution in 1979.

 [Y]ic fundament[X]sm has appeared in many countries; the salafi-wahhabi version is promoted worldwide and financed by saudi arabia, qatar, and pakistan.

 the media, in an attempt to explain the ideology of ayatollah khomeini and the iranian revolution to a western audience described it as a "fundament[X]st version of [Y]" by way of analogy to the christian fundament[X]st movement in the u.

 thus was born the term [Y]ic fundament[X]st, which became a common use of the term in following years.

 for instance, the archbishop of wales has criticized "atheistic fundament[X]sm" broadly and said "any kind of fundament[X]sm, be it biblical, atheistic or [Y]ic, is dangerous".

 in the united states, private or cultural intolerance of women wearing the hijab ([Y]ic headcovering) and political activism by muslims also has been labeled "secular fundament[X]sm".

influential criticisms of fundament[X]sm include james barr's books on christian fundament[X]sm and bassam tibi's analysis of [Y]ic fundament[X]sm.

 both fell under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority, but the strip has, since the battle of gaza in june 2007, been governed by hamas, a militant, palestinian, fundament[X]st [Y]ic organization, which came to power in the last-held elections in 2006.

  during the 7th century the territory was passed back and forth between the eastern roman (byzantine) empire and the persian (sasanian) empires before the rashidun c[X]phate was established during the great [Y]ic expansions of the 7th century.

 the second intifada also marked the beginning of rocket attacks and bombings of israeli border loc[X]ties by palestinian guerrillas from the gaza strip, especially by the hamas and palestinian [Y]ic jihad movements.

palestinian researcher khaled al-hroub has criticized what he called the "t[X]ban-like steps" hamas has taken: "the [Y]ization that has been forced upon the gaza strip—the suppression of social, cultural, and press freedoms that do not suit hamas's view[s]—is an egregious deed that must be opposed.

 these beliefs—in particular, that jesus is a prophet of god and raised [X]ve without being crucified—conform to or resemble [Y]ic teachings which say that jesus is a major prophet who did not die on the cross but was taken [X]ve by angels to god.

 some 16th-century anti-trinitarian divines sought to reconcile christianity, [Y] and judaism; on the basis of very similar arguments to those presented in the gospel of barnabas, arguing that if salvation remains unresolved until the end times, then any one of the three religions could be a v[X]d path to heaven for their own believers.

although their mort[X]ty ranks them lower than gods, it seems that the veneration of jinn had played more importance in the everyday life of pre-[Y]ic arabs than the gods themselves.

contemporary salafi tenets of [Y] reject modern interpretations of jinn, and adhere to liter[X]sm, arguing that the threat of jinn and their ability to possess humans can be proven by quran and sunnah.

 al-munajjid further asserts that reciting various quranic verses and adhkaar (devotional acts involving the repetition of short sentences glorifying god) "prescribed in sharia" [[Y]ic law] can protect against jinn, and that [Y]ic he[X]ng rituals common across [Y]ic culture used to prevent or expel jinn possession are actually shirk (polytheism).

jinn feature in the magical re[X]sm genre, introduced into turkish literature by tekin (1983), who uses magical elements known from pre-[Y]ic and [Y]ic anatolian lore.

the jinn had an indirect impact on [Y]ic art through the creation of t[X]smans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included qur'anic verses.

for the duration of the 6th century, the eastern roman empire was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the persian sassanid empire (see roman–persian wars), followed by the onslaught of the arising [Y]ic c[X]phate (rashidun and umayyad).

from the 7th century byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of [Y] and the c[X]phates.

 this trend, which included the conquests by the invading muslim forces and by that the spread of [Y] as well continued under umar's successors and under the umayyad c[X]phate, which conquered the rest of mediterranean north africa and most of the iberian peninsula.

 the personal protection of most politicians, especially of the [Y] critic ayaan hirsi [X], was stepped up to unprecedented levels.

the almohads, who had taken control of the almoravids' maghribi and al-andalus territories by 1147, surpassed the almoravides in fundament[X]st [Y]ic outlook, and they treated the non-believer dhimmis harshly.

for about the next 10 years, the country saw a steady process of secular westernization through atatürk's reforms, which included the unification of education; the discontinuation of religious and other titles; the closure of [Y]ic courts and the replacement of [Y]ic canon law with a secular civil code modeled after switzerland's and a penal code modeled after the it[X]an penal code; recognition of the equ[X]ty between the sexes and the granting of full political rights to women on 5 december 1934; the language reform initiated by the newly founded turkish language association; replacement of the ottoman turkish alphabet with the new turkish alphabet derived from the latin alphabet; the dress law (the wearing of a fez, is outlawed); the law on family names; and many others.

 following the deportation and enslavement of the muslim moors from the emirate of sicily and other it[X]an territories, the [Y]ic iberia was gradually conquered by christian forces during the reconquista.

 for the time prior to the beginning of [Y]—in the 6th century ce—sources are superior as well, if still of mixed qu[X]ty.

 thus, the subsequent [Y]ic empires were known as "c[X]phates", and a series of four c[X]phs governed the early [Y]ic empire: abū bakr (632–634), ʿumar ibn al-khaṭṭāb (umar І, 634–644), ʿuthmān ibn ʿaffān (644–656), and ʿalī ibn abī Ṭālib (656–661).

 these leaders are known as the rāshidūn ("rightly-guided") c[X]phs in sunnī [Y].

alongside the growth of the umayyad c[X]phate, the major political development within early [Y] in this period was the sectarian split and political divide between kharijite, sunnī, and shīʿa muslims; this had its roots in a dispute over the succession for the role of c[X]ph.

 muhammad's closest companions (ṣaḥāba), the four "rightly-guided" c[X]phs who succeeded him, continued to expand the [Y]ic empire to encompass jerusalem, ctesiphon, and damascus, and sending arab muslim armies as far as the sindh region.

 these imams were recognized by shia [Y] taking imam [X] as first c[X]ph/ imam and the same is institution[X]zed by the safavids and many similar institutions named now as ismaili, twelver etc.

 al-w[X]d i began the next stage of [Y]ic conquests.

[Y]ic world during the abbasid c[X]phate 

 the [Y]ic kingdoms associated with m[X] reached prominence in the 13th century.

 [Y] recognized to a certain extent the v[X]dity of the abrahamic religions, the quran identifying jews, christians, zoroastrians, and sabians (commonly identified with the mandaeans) as "people of the book".

politically, the abbasid c[X]phate evolved into an [Y]ic monarchy (unitary system of government.

 al-mahdi proclaimed that the c[X]ph was the protector of [Y] against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy.

 the kingdom of jerusalem and other smaller crusader kingdoms over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated politics of the levant, but did not threaten the [Y]ic c[X]phate nor other powers in the region.

 however, the crusaders did manage to damage [Y]ic c[X]phates; according to william of malmesbury, preventing them from further expansion into christendom and being targets of the mamluks and the mongols.

 the ilkhans of chingisid descendence claimed to be defenders of [Y], perhaps even the heirs of the abbasid c[X]phate.

early [Y]ic disciples fled to the port city of zeila in modern-day northern som[X]a to seek protection from the quraysh at the court of the aksumite emperor in present-day som[X]a.

 the victory of the muslims over the quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in arabia had by then all adopted [Y], and the major trading routes in the mediterranean and the red sea came under the sway of the muslim c[X]phs.

 native legends say that a group of sahaba, under m[X]k ibn deenar, arrived on the malabar coast and preached [Y].

during the early period of [Y], c[X]phs were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of the prophet mohammed.

in the [Y]ic republic of iran, the supreme leader, at present [X] khamenei serves as head of state.

in addition, in antiquity and the middle ages, hinduism was the state religion in many indianized kingdoms of asia, the greater indiafrom afghanistan (kabul) in the west and including almost all of southeast asia in the east (cambodia, vietnam, indonesia, partly philippines)and only by 15th century was nearly everywhere supplanted by buddhism and [Y], except several still hindu minor austronesian ethnic groups, such as the b[X]nese and tenggerese people in indonesia, and the chams in vietnam.

 in a series of rapid muslim conquests, the arab armies, motivated by [Y] and led by the c[X]phs and skilled military commanders such as kh[X]d ibn al-w[X]d, swept through most of the middle east; reducing byzantine lands by more than half and completely engulfing the persian lands.

 the [Y]ic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to europe was soon in the hands of it[X]an traders, especially the genoese and the venetians, who profited immensely from it.

muslim rulers nominated by the [Y]ic c[X]phate remained in control of egypt for the next six centuries, with cairo as the seat of the c[X]phate under the fatimids.

 it included two flags: the flag of the ottoman dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the [Y]ic c[X]ph, which had three crescents on a green base.

 in the course of the poem, "he considers every form of sexual orientation – celibacy, homosexu[X]ty, hedonism, and heterosexu[X]ty – raising the same kinds of questions as when he considers [Y] or democracy".

 in [Y]ic literature, 'abd al-m[X]k isami's persian work, futuhu's-salatin, composed in the deccan in 1350, uses the word '  to mean indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word '  to mean 'hindu' in the sense of a follower of the hindu religion".

 in the 11th-century text of al biruni, hindus are referred to as "religious antagonists" to [Y], as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between hindus holding a centr[X]st and plur[X]st religious views.

beyond the stipulations of british law, colonial orient[X]sts and particularly the influential asiatick researches founded in the 18th century, later called the asiatic society, initially identified just two religions in india – [Y], and hinduism.

 there were occasional exceptions such as akbar who stopped the persecution of hindus, and occasional severe persecution such as under aurangzeb, who destroyed temples, forcibly converted non-muslims to [Y] and banned the celebration of hindu festivals such as holi and diw[X].

christophe jaffrelot states that modern hindu nation[X]sm was born in maharashtra, in the 1920s, as a reaction to the [Y]ic khilafat movement wherein indian muslims championed and took the cause of the turkish ottoman sultan as the c[X]ph of all muslims, at the end of the world war i.

 hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of indian muslim population, of pan-[Y]ic hegemony, and questioned whether indian muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial indian nation[X]sm.

chris bayly traces the roots of hindu nation[X]sm to the hindu identity and political independence achieved by the maratha confederacy, that overthrew the [Y]ic mughal empire in large parts of india, allowing hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored hindu holy places such as varanasi.

 jaffrelot states that the efforts of christian missionaries and [Y]ic proselytizers, during the british colonial era, each of whom tried to gain new converts to their own religion, by stereotyping and stigmatising hindus to an identity of being inferior and superstitious, contributed to hindus re-asserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining [Y] and christianity, forming organisations such as the hindu sabhas (hindu associations), and ultimately a hindu-identity driven nation[X]sm in the 1920s.

 in the 20th century, the sense of religious nation[X]sm grew in india, states van der veer, but only muslim nation[X]sm succeeded with the formation of the west and east pakistan (later split into pakistan and bangladesh), as "an [Y]ic state" upon independence.

the hindu nation[X]sm movement has sought to reform indian laws, that critics say attempts to impose hindu values on india's [Y]ic minority.

 in contrast, opponents of hindu nation[X]sts remark that eliminating religious law from india poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of muslims, and people of [Y]ic faith have a constitutional right to [Y]ic shariah-based personal laws.

 brown, early schools of [Y]ic jurisprudence  used rulings of the prophet's companions, the rulings of the c[X]phs, and practices that “had gained general acceptance among the jurists of that school”.

 by the start of the 16th century, with the malacca sultanate in the malay peninsula and parts of sumatra, the demak sultanate in java, and other kingdoms around the malay archipelago increasingly converting to [Y], it had become the dominant religion among malays, and reached as far as the modern-day philippines, leaving b[X] as an isolated outpost of hinduism today.

 a small class of malay nation[X]st intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of [Y] in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly christianity.

 at the same time, an [Y]ist party, the [Y]ic party of malaysia (pas) and a democratic soci[X]st party, the democratic action party (dap), gained increasing support, at the expense of umno and the mca respectively.

 sadat was assassinated in 1981 by [Y]ic fundament[X]st members of the egyptian army who opposed peace with israel.

 the palestinian armed factions in the gaza strip, led by the [Y]ic jihad and the popular resistance committees, fired a massive amount of rockets towards southern israel in ret[X]ation, sparking five days of clashes along the gaza border.

the history of libya comprises six distinct perspectives: ancient libya, the roman era, the [Y]ic era, ottoman rule, it[X]an rule, and the modern era.

 during the following centuries libya came under the rule of several [Y]ic dynasties, under various levels of autonomy from ummayad, abbasid and fatimid c[X]phates of the time.

 though not creating a secular state – article 5 proclaims [Y] the religion of the state – the libyan constitution did formally set out rights such as equ[X]ty before the law as well as equal civil and political rights, equal opportunities, and an equal responsibility for public duties and obligations, "without distinction of religion, belief, race, language, wealth, kinship or political or social opinions" (article 11).

 in the early hours of 21 february 2011, saif al-[Y] gaddafi, oldest son of muammar gaddafi, spoke on libyan television of his fears that the country would fragment and be replaced by "15 [Y]ic fundament[X]st emirates" if the uprising engulfed the entire state.

 the main forces involved during that period in kabul, northern, central and eastern afghanistan were the hezb-i [Y]i of gulbuddin hekmatyar directed by pakistan, the hezb-i wahdat of abdul [X] mazari directed by iran, the ittehad-i [Y]i of abdul rasul sayyaf supported by saudi arabia, the junbish-i milli of abdul rashid dostum backed by uzbekisten, the harakat-i [Y]i of hussain anwari and the shura-i nazar operating as the regular [Y]ic state forces (as agreed upon in the peshawar accords) under the defence ministry of ahmad shah massoud.

 in 1994, the t[X]ban (a movement originating from jamiat ulema-e-[Y]-run religious schools for afghan refugees in pakistan) also developed in afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.

in 1995 the hezb-i [Y]i of gulbuddin hekmatyar, the iranian-backed hezb-i wahdat as well as rashid dostum's junbish forces were defeated militarily in the capital kabul by forces of the interim government under massoud who subsequently tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the t[X]ban to join the process.

the t[X]ban started shelling kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the [Y]ic state government under ahmad shah massoud.

 the t[X]ban seized kabul on september 27, 1996, and established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 he stated that the t[X]ban and al qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of [Y]" and that without the support of pakistan the t[X]ban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.

 the t[X]ban declined to participate, saying "the [Y]ic emirate has a clear position.

 despite the t[X]ban taking kabul, the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan still exists as a rump state.

 its members included several [Y]ic organisations in india, as well as 1400 nation[X]st muslim delegates.

hamas (, ; , ; an acronym of  , "[Y]ic resistance movement") is a palestinian sunni-[Y]ic fundament[X]st, militant, and nation[X]st organization.

 the muslim brotherhood arose as an attempt to have [Y]ic values extend beyond the mosque into the secular sphere, where it challenged the core assumptions, social, political, ideological, nation[X]st and economic of the existing ruling order.

creating hamas as an entity distinct from the muslim brotherhood was a matter of practic[X]ty; the muslim brotherhood refused to engage in violence against israel, but without participating in the intifada, the [Y]ists tied to it feared they would lose support to their rivals the palestinian [Y]ic jihad and the plo.

on june 25, two israeli soldiers were killed and another, gilad sh[X]t, captured following an incursion by the izz ad-din al-qassam brigades, popular resistance committees and army of [Y].

 it declares all of palestine a waqf, an un[X]enable religious property consisting of land endowed to muslims in perpetuity by god,  with religious coexistence under [Y]'s rule.

in 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in qalqiliya were suddenly banned by the hamas led municip[X]ty, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by [Y], or "haram".

 khaled al-hroub of the west bank-based and anti-hamas palestinian daily al ayyam added that despite claims by hamas leaders that it wants to repeat the turkish model of [Y], "what is happening on the ground in re[X]ty is a replica of the t[X]ban model of [Y].

 they were behind world war i, when they were able to destroy the [Y]ic c[X]phate, making financial gains and controlling resources.

 egyptian authorities stated that the 2011 alexandria bombing was carried out by the gaza-based army of [Y], which has received sanctuary from hamas and earlier collaborated in the capture of gilad sh[X]t.

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm

 the organization was established as part of an iranian effort, through funding and the dispatch of a core group of [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps (pasdaran) instructors, to aggregate a variety of lebanese shia groups into a unified organization to resist the israeli occupation and improve the standing and status of the long margin[X]sed and underrepresented shia community in that country.

during the lebanese civil war, hezbollah's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of "the americans, the french and their allies definitely from lebanon, putting an end to any coloni[X]st entity on our land", the submission of the christian phalangists to "just power", bringing them to justice "for the crimes they have perpetrated against muslims and christians", and permitting "all the sons of our people" to choose the form of government they want, while calling on them to "pick the option of [Y]ic government".

the ideology of hezbollah has been summarized as shi'i radic[X]sm; hezbollah follows the [Y]ic shi'a theology developed by iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini.

in 2010, iran's parliamentary speaker [X] larijani said, "iran takes pride in lebanon's [Y]ic resistance movement for its steadfast [Y]ic stance.

materials aimed at instilling principles of nation[X]sm and [Y] in children are an aspect of hezbollah's media operations.

[X] kourani, the first hezbollah operative to be convicted and sentenced in the united states, was under investigation since 2013 and worked to provide targeting and terrorist recruiting information to hezbollah's [Y]ic jihad organization.

" tuení believed that hezbollah's evolution is cosmetic, conce[X]ng a sinister long-term strategy to [Y]icize lebanon and lead it into a ruinous war with israel.

academics speci[X]zing in a wide variety of the social sciences believe that hezbollah is an example of an [Y]ic terrorist organization.

hyenas are used for food and medicinal purposes in som[X]a although they are considered haraam in [Y].

in the court of al-ma'mun, imam [X] al-ridha, a descendant of the prophet muhammad and chief [Y]ic scholar in the time of the abbasid c[X]phs, was asked by the exilarch to prove that muhammad was a prophet through the torah.

the famous and revered persian [Y]ic scholar and polymath ibn qutaybah, who served as a judge during the abbasid c[X]phate, said of the prophet habakkuk: "among the words of habakkuk, who prophesied in the days of daniel, habakkuk says: 'god came from teman, and the holy one from the mountains of paran and the earth was filled with the sanctification of the praiseworthy one (aḥmad, which is a name of muhammad in [Y]), and with his right hand he exercised power over the earth and the necks of the nations,'" which has been interpreted by scholars to be a clear allusion to habakkuk 3:3-4.

the shah urged that humayun convert from sunni to shia [Y] in order to keep himself and several hundred followers [X]ve.

 during emperor shah jahan and his son aurangzeb's [Y]ic sharia reigns, the empire reached its architectural and economic zenith, and became the world's largest economy, worth over 25% of world gdp and signaled the proto-industri[X]zation.

the birth of [Y] opposite som[X]a's red sea coast meant that som[X] merchants and sailors living on the arabian peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted arab muslim trading partners.

 with the migration of muslim families from the [Y]ic world to som[X]a in the early centuries of [Y], and the peaceful conversion of the som[X] population by som[X] muslim scholars in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into [Y]ic mogadishu, berbera, zeila, barawa and merka, which were part of the berber (the medieval arab term for the ancestors of the modern som[X]s) civilization.

 the berber people, being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to arab exclusivity in orthodox [Y], adopted shi'ite and kharijite [Y], both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the abbasid c[X]phate.

 he invited scholars and architects like ishal al-tuedjin (al-sahili) to further integrate m[X] into the [Y]ic world.

 [Y] was used to extend his authority by declaring jihad on the mossi, reviving the trans-saharan trade, and having the abbasid "shadow" c[X]ph in cairo declare him as c[X]ph of sudan.

 in 1981, sadat was assassinated by members of the egyptian [Y]ic jihad under kh[X]d [Y]bouli.

 north africa serves as a raci[X]zed region of “european africa”, which is conceptually disconnected from sub-saharan africa, and conceptually connected to the middle east, asia, and the [Y]ic world.

as opposed to having been developed through field research, the analogy in the present-day european africanist paradigm, which conceptually [X]enates, dehistoricizes, and denatur[X]zes darker skinned north africans in north africa and darker skinned africans throughout the [Y]ic world at-large, is primarily rooted in an americanized textual tradition inherited from 19th century european christian abolitionists.

, north africa with niger and m[X], north africa with tanzania and sudan, major hubs of [Y]ic learning in niger and m[X]).

 under boumédiène's rule, leftist and soci[X]st concepts were merged with [Y].

  on one hand, he made token concessions and cosmetic changes to the government to appear more [Y]ic, such as putting [Y]ist ahmed taleb ibrahimi in charge of national education in 1965 and adopting policies crimin[X]zing gambling, establishing friday as the national holiday, and dropping plans to introduce birth control to paint an [Y]ic image of the new government.

 the ottoman government followed [Y]ic law when de[X]ng with the conquered christian population.

 the division was between the tanzeem nasle nau hazara, a party based in quetta, of hazara nation[X]sts and secular intellectuals, and the [Y]ist parties in hazarajat.

as the soviets withdrew in 1989, the [Y]ist groups felt the need to broaden their political appeal and turned their focus to hazara ethnic nation[X]sm.

 hazara famous football players are zohib [Y] amiri, who is currently playing for the afghanistan national football team, moshtagh yaghoubi an afghan-finnish footballer who plays for hifk, mustafa amini an afghan-austr[X]an footballer who plays as a midfielder for danish superliga club agf and the austr[X]an national team, rahmat akbari an afghan-austr[X]an footballer who plays as a midfielder for brisbane roar, and others like [X] hazara and zahra mahmoodi.

 this was influenced by the direction, energy, and resources that the early umayyad c[X]phs directed after the death of prophet muhammad (632 ce) towards spreading [Y] to the nations that they invaded and the expansion of their c[X]phate.

 however, this rising interest in [Y]ic medicine grew significantly when the abbasid c[X]phate (750-1258 ce) overthrew the umayyad c[X]phate in 750 ce.

 additionally, during this time the creation of the first [Y]ic hospital in 805 ce by the abbasid c[X]ph harun al-rashid in baghdad was recounted as a glorious event of the golden age.

 taking leads from greece and rome, [Y]ic scholars kept both the art and science of medicine [X]ve and moving forward.

 institution[X]zation of medicine was another important achievement in the [Y]ic world.

 although hospitals as an institution for the sick emerged in the byzantium empire, the model of institution[X]zed medicine for all social classes was extensive in the [Y]ic empire and was scattered throughout.

in the south, sicily had become an [Y]ic emirate in the 9th century, thriving until the italo-normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the lombard and byzantine princip[X]ties of southern italy.

 donations are allowed to christian, jewish, buddhist and hindu communities; however, [Y] remains excluded, since no muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the it[X]an state.

 the country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the united nations, world trade organization, g20, and a founding member of the non-[X]gned movement, association of southeast asian nations, east asia summit, and the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation.

indonesia has been a member of the united nations since 1950 and was a founding member of the non-[X]gned movement (nam) and the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation (oic).

 trade, [Y]ic missionary activity such as by the w[X] sanga and chinese explorer zheng he, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of [Y].

 while india was the only south asian country to recognise the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan in the 1980s, its relations were diminished during the afghan civil wars and the rule of the [Y]ist t[X]ban in the 1990s.

 on 10 september 1912, the first nation[X]st mass movement was formed: sarekat [Y].

as a multi-ethnic and multicultural democratic country with a muslim-majority population, indonesia faces the challenge of de[X]ng with terrorism linked to global militant [Y]ic movements.

 one cultural pattern consists of the formerly indianized, rice-growing peasants in the valleys and plains of sumatra, java, and b[X], another cultural complex is composed of the largely [Y]ic coastal commercial sector, a third, more marginal sector consists of the upland forest farming communities which exist by means of subsistence swidden agriculture.

 since 2001, the government of indonesia has co-operated with the us in cracking down on [Y]ic fundament[X]sm and terrorist groups.

the government of iran is an [Y]ic theocracy which includes elements of a presidential democracy, with the ultimate authority vested in an autocratic "supreme leader", a position held by [X] khamenei since khomeini's death in 1989.

 although both nation[X]sts and marxists had initially joined with [Y]ists to overthrow the shah, tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards.

 three days after, iran's [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps launched a ret[X]atory attack on us forces in iraq and by accident shot down ukraine international airlines flight 752, killing 176 civilians and leading to nation-wide protests.

 chapter ix of the constitution of the [Y]ic republic of iran sets forth the qu[X]fications for presidential candidates.

the [Y]ic republic of iran has two types of armed forces: the regular forces of the army, the air force, and the navy, and the revolutionary guards, tot[X]ng about 545,000 active troops.

legal public holidays based on the iranian solar calendar include the cultural celebrations of nowruz (farvardin 1–4; 21–24 march) and sizdebedar (farvardin 13; 2april), and the political events of [Y]ic republic day (farvardin 12; 1april), the death of ruhollah khomeini (khordad 14; 4june), the khordad 15 event (khordad 15; 5june), the anniversary of the 1979 revolution (bahman 22; 10 february), and oil nation[X]zation day (esfand 29; 19 march).

 the sassanid empire was eventually conquered by the rashidun c[X]phate in the 7th century, with iraq specifically falling under [Y]ic rule following the battle of al-qadisiyyah in 636.

 baghdad would remain the capital of the abbasid c[X]phate for the majority of its existence, during which time it became the cultural and intellectual center of the world in what is known today as the [Y]ic golden age.

in spite of having lost all governance, the abbasid c[X]phs nevertheless maintained a highly ritu[X]zed court in baghdad and remained influential in religious matters, maintaining the orthodoxy of their sunni sect in opposition to the ismaili and shia  sects of [Y].

 this demand of behramani caused much dismay on the american side as it made clear to them that they would not be de[X]ng solely with a "moderate" faction in the [Y]ic republic, as the americans liked to pretend to themselves, but rather with all the factions in the iranian government – including those who were very much involved in terrorism.

kh[X]d chraibi, the reform of the [Y]ic calendar: the terms of the debate, tabsir.

 following the abbasid takeover from the umayyads and the shift of the economic centre of the [Y]ic c[X]phate from damascus to baghdad, the western province of al-andalus was margin[X]sed and ultimately became politically autonomous as independent emirate in 756, ruled by one of the last surviving umayyad royals, abd al-rahman i.

tensions between iraq and iran were fuelled by iran's [Y]ic revolution and its appearance of being a pan-[Y]ic force, in contrast to iraq's arab nation[X]sm.

 iran's new [Y]ic administration was regarded in baghdad as an irrational, existential threat to the ba'ath government, especially because the ba'ath party, having a secular nature, discriminated against and posed a threat to the fundament[X]st shia movement in iraq, whose clerics were iran's allies within iraq and whom khomeini saw as oppressed.

 on 28 june 1981, they assassinated the secretary-general of the [Y]ic republican party, mohammad beheshti and on 30 august, killed iran's president, mohammad-[X] rajai.

 the [Y]ic revolution of iran was strengthened and radic[X]sed.

economic historians and authors such as mendels, pomeranz and kridte argue that proto-industri[X]zation in parts of europe, [Y]ic world, mughal india, and china created the social and economic conditions that led to the industrial revolution, thus causing the great divergence.

[Y]ism (also often called political [Y] or [Y]ic fundament[X]sm) is a political ideology which posits that modern states and regions should be reconstituted in constitutional, economic and judicial terms, in accordance with what is conceived as a revival or a return to authentic [Y]ic practice in its tot[X]ty.

 [Y]ists may emphasize the implementation of sharia, pan-[Y]ic political unity, the creation of [Y]ic states, or the outright removal of non-muslim influences; particularly of western or universal economic, military, political, social, or cultural nature in the muslim world; that they believe to be incompatible with [Y] and a form of western neocoloni[X]sm.

 by the turn of the twentieth century the shorter and purely arabic term "[Y]" had begun to  displace it, and by 1938, when orient[X]st scholars completed the encyclopaedia of [Y], [Y]ism seems to have virtually disappeared from english usage.

 from french, it began to migrate to the english language in the mid-1980s, and in recent years has largely displaced the term [Y]ic fundament[X]sm in academic circles.

the new use of the term "[Y]ism" at first functioned as "a marker for scholars more likely to sympathize" with new [Y]ic movements; however, as the term gained popularity it became more specifically associated with political groups such as the t[X]ban or the algerian armed [Y]ic group, as well as with highly publicized acts of violence.

 to all intents and purposes, [Y]ic fundament[X]sm and [Y]ism have become synonyms in contemporary american usage.

] the whole body of thought which seeks to invest society with [Y] which may be integrationist, but may also be tradition[X]st, reform-minded or even revolutionary"

 jihadist organizations like al-qaeda and the egyptian [Y]ic jihad, and groups such as the t[X]ban, entirely reject democracy, often declaring as kuffar those muslims who support it (see takfirism), as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis.

 fuller has described as the fundament[X]st "guardians of the tradition" (salafis, such as those in the wahhabi movement) and the "vanguard of change and [Y]ic reform" centered around the muslim brotherhood.

a writer for the international crisis group maintains that "the conception of 'political [Y]'" is a creation of americans to explain the iranian [Y]ic revolution and apolitical [Y] was a historical fluke of the "short-lived era of the heyday of secular arab nation[X]sm between 1945 and 1970", and it is quietist/non-political [Y], not [Y]ism, that requires explanation.

 olivier roy believes "the socioeconomic re[X]ties that sustained the [Y]ist wave are still here and are not going to change: poverty, uprootedness, crises in values and identities, the decay of the educational systems, the north-south opposition, and the problem of immigrant integration into the host societies".

 critics of the concept hold that [Y]ist aspirations are fundamentally incompatible with the democratic principles, thus even moderate [Y]ists are tot[X]tarian in nature.

" this state originally pertained only to iran, where "post-[Y]ism is expressed in the idea of fusion between [Y] (as a person[X]zed faith) and individual freedom and choice; and post-[Y]ism is associated with the values of democracy and aspects of modernity".

 there, muslim brothers' [Y]ism had synthesized with salafism, and led to the creation of the salafi activist trend exemplified by the sahwa movement in the 80s, promulgated by safar al-haw[X] and salman al-ouda.

 wahhabism is also characterized by its disinterest in social justice, anticoloni[X]sm, or economic equ[X]ty, expounded upon by the mainstream [Y]ists.

 under this condition, qutb had cultivated his [Y]ist ideology in his seminal work ma'[X]m fi-l-tariq (milestones), in which he equated the muslims within the nasser regime with secularism and the west, and described them as regression back to jahiliyyah (period of time before the advent of [Y]).

salafi jihadism is a term coined by gilles kepel in 2002, referring to the ideology which actively promotes and conducts violence and terrorism in order to pursue the establishment of an [Y]ic state or a new c[X]phate.

some [Y]ic reviv[X]st movements and leaders pre-dating [Y]ism include:

 shah w[X]ullah was a forerunner of reformist [Y]ists like muhammad abduh, muhammad iqbal and muhammad asad in his belief that there was "a constant need for new ijtihad as the muslim community progressed and expanded and new generations had to cope with new problems" and his interest in the social and economic problems of the poor.

 sayyid ahmad barelvi was a disciple and successor of shah w[X]ullah's son who emphasized the 'purification' of [Y] from un-[Y]ic beliefs and practices.

  unlike some later [Y]ists, early salafiyya strongly emphasized the restoration of the c[X]phate.

the crises experienced across the muslim world after the collapse of ottoman c[X]phate would re-introduce the debates over the theory of an alternative [Y]ic state into the centre of muslim religious-political thinking of the early 20th-century.

 as the circumstances shifted through further western cultural and imperial inroads, militant [Y]ists and fundament[X]sts stepped up to assert [Y]ic values using rida's ideas as the chief vehicle, starting from 1950s.

in his influential book al-khilafa aw al-imama al-'uzma ("the c[X]phate or the grand imamate"); rashid rida elaborated on the establishment of his proposed “[Y]ic state”  which emphasised the implementation of sharia as well as the adoption of an [Y]ic consultation system (shura) that enshrined leading role of the ulema ([Y]ic scholars) in political life.

in rida's c[X]phate, the kh[X]fa was to be the supreme head whose role was to govern by supervising the application of [Y]ic laws.

 this khilafa shall also be able to revit[X]se the [Y]ic civilization, restore political and legal independence to the muslim umma (community of muslim believers), and cleanse [Y] from the heretical influences of sufism.

 rashid rida's [Y]ic political theory would greatly influence many subsequent [Y]ic reviv[X]st movements across the arab world.

 rida was certain that an [Y]ic society which implemented sharia in the proper manner would be able to successfully resist both capit[X]sm as well as the disorder of class-based soci[X]sm; since such a society would be unsusceptible to its temptations.

muhammad iqbal was a philosopher, poet and politician in british india who is widely regarded as having inspired the [Y]ic nation[X]sm and pakistan movement in british india.

iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nation[X]sm weaken the spiritual foundations of [Y] and muslim society, but that india's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage, culture and political influence.

 in his travels to egypt, afghanistan, palestine and syria, he promoted ideas of greater [Y]ic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nation[X]st differences.

 trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journ[X]sm, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about [Y] and [Y]ic law.

maududi's political ideas influenced sayyid qutb a leading member of the muslim brotherhood movement, and one of the key philosophers of [Y]ism and highly influential thinkers of [Y]ic univers[X]sm.

 sharia law was not only accessible to humans and essential to the existence of [Y], but also all-encompassing, precluding "evil and corrupt" non-[Y]ic ideologies like communism, nation[X]sm, or secular democracy.

 ba'athism, arab soci[X]sm, and arab nation[X]sm suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic [Y]ist movements inspired by maududi and sayyid qutb gained ground.

the views of [X] shariati, the ideologue of the iranian revolution, resembled those of mohammad iqbal, the ideological father of the state of pakistan, but khomeini's beliefs are perceived to be placed somewhere between the beliefs of shia [Y] and the beliefs of sunni [Y]ic thinkers like mawdudi and qutb.

 he believed that complete imitation of the prophet mohammad and his successors such as [X] for the restoration of sharia law was essential to [Y], that many secular, westernizing muslims were actually agents of the west and therefore serving western interests, and that acts such as the "plundering" of muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against [Y] by western governments.

 khomeini talked not about restoring the c[X]phate or sunni [Y]ic democracy, but about establishing a state where the guardianship of the democratic or the dictatorial political system was performed by shia jurists (ulama) as the successors of shia imams until the mahdi returns from occultation.

the revolution was influenced by marxism through [Y]ist thought and also by writings that sought either to counter marxism (muhammad baqir al-sadr's work) or to integrate soci[X]sm and [Y]ism  ([X] shariati's work).

the strength of the [Y]ist movement was manifest in an event which might have seemed sure to turn muslim public opinion against fundament[X]sm, but did just the opposite.

instead of prompting a backlash against the movement from which the attackers originated, however, saudi arabia, already very conservative, responded by shoring up its fundament[X]st credentials with even more [Y]ic restrictions.

in other muslim countries, blame for and wrath against the seizure was directed not against fundament[X]sts, but against [Y]ic fundament[X]sm's foremost geopolitical enemy—the united states.

another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radic[X]ze the [Y]ist movement was the gulf war, which brought several hundred thousand us and allied non-muslim military personnel to saudi arabian soil to put an end to saddam hussein's occupation of kuwait.

  [Y]ism had been an ide[X]zed/utopian  concept to compare with the grim re[X]ty of the status quo, but in more than four decades it had failed to establish a "concrete and viable blueprint for society" despite repeated efforts (olivier roy); and instead had left a less than inspiring track record of its impact on the world (nader hashemi).

 in 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic [Y]ist movement known as the t[X]ban rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of afghanistan.

 the t[X]ban differed from other [Y]ist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as [Y]ic fundament[X]st or neofundament[X]st, interested in spreading "an ide[X]zed and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs" under the label of sharia to an entire country.

 founded as a broad [Y]ist co[X]tion in 1989 it was led by abbassi madani, and a charismatic [Y]ist young preacher, [X] belhadj.

 since 2000, the main political opposition bangladesh nation[X]st party (bnp) has been allied with it and another [Y]ic party, [Y]i oikya jote.

 [X] bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with [Y]ists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown.

 the green algeria alliance is an [Y]ist co[X]tion of political parties, created for the legislative election of 2012 in algeria.

 however, the incumbent co[X]tion, comprising the fln of president abdelaziz bouteflika and the rnd of prime minister ahmed ouyahia, held on to power after winning a majority of seats, and the [Y]ist parties of the green algeria alliance lost seats in the legislative election of 2012.

 eastern africa has become a hotbed of violent [Y]ic extremism since the late 1990s, one of the relevant movements being al-shabaab, active in som[X]a and kenya, which emerged in response to the 2006–09 ethiopian intervention in som[X]a.

 west africa has seen the rise of influential [Y]ic extremist organizations, notably boko haram in northern nigeria and al-qaeda in the [Y]ic maghreb in m[X].

 ht is unique from most other [Y]ist movements in that the party focuses not on implementation of sharia on local level or on providing social services, but on unifying the muslim world under its vision of a new [Y]ic c[X]phate spanning from north africa and the middle east to much of central and south asia.

in its focus on the c[X]phate, the party takes a different view of muslim history than some other [Y]ists such as muhammad qutb.

 ht sees [Y]'s pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of [X], or one of the other four "rightly guided" c[X]phs in the 7th century, but with the abolition of the ottoman c[X]phate in 1924.

 such a demographic, [X]enated from the westernized ways of the urban elite, but uprooted from the comforts and more passive traditions of the villages they came from, is understandably favourably disposed to an [Y]ic system promising a better world—an ideology providing an "emotionally familiar basis for group identity, solidarity, and exclusion; an acceptable basis for legitimacy and authority; an immediately intelligible formulation of principles for both a critique of the present and a program for the future.

[Y]ism can also be described as part of identity politics, specifically the religiously-oriented nation[X]sm that emerged in the third world in the 1970s: "resurgent hinduism in india, religious zionism in israel, militant buddhism in sri lanka, resurgent sikh nation[X]sm in the punjab, 'liberation theology' of catholicism in latin america, and [Y]ism in the muslim world.

the connection between the lack of an [Y]ic spirit and the lack of victory was underscored by the disastrous defeat of arab nation[X]st-led armies fighting under the slogan "land, sea and air" in the 1967 six-day war, compared to the (perceived) near-victory of the yom kippur war six years later.

the funding was also used to reward journ[X]sts and academics who followed the saudis' strict interpretation of [Y]; and satellite campuses were built around egypt for al-azhar university, the world's oldest and most influential [Y]ic university.

 qatar maintained its influence through key facilitators on the field, including cleric [X] al-sallabi, the leader of the [Y]ist militia "february 17 katiba" ismail al-sallabi, and the tripoli military council leader abdel hakim belhaj.

 [Y]ists were considered by western governments bulwarks against—what were thought to be at the time—more dangerous leftist/communist/nation[X]st insurgents/opposition, which [Y]ists were correctly seen as opposing.

 a major exception to this pattern of tolerance in early [Y]ic history was the "edict of yazīd", issued by the umayyad c[X]ph yazīd ii in 722–723.

during the tuareg rebellion of 2012, the radical [Y]ist militia ansar dine destroyed various sufi shrines from the 15th and 16th centuries in the city of timbuktu, m[X].

 he is further mentioned and accepted as a prophet by other [Y]ic scholars such as ibn kathir, al-tha`labi and kisa'i and also modern scholars such as muhammad asad and abdullah yusuf [X].

 as a young man, he would have studied at a sunni m[X]ki madh'hab ([Y]ic jurisprudence school), the dominant form of education in north africa at that time.

 intervention in afghanistan, he fought against the t[X]ban within the united [Y]ic front for the salvation of afghanistan (northern alliance) and thus regained his position as governor of herat after they were victorious in december 2001.

 speci[X]zes in comparative and international politics; women, gender, and [Y]; [Y] and qur'anic hermeneutics

 within the quran, it's never stated that homosexu[X]ty is punishable by death, and modern historians conclude that the [Y]ic prophet muhammad never forbade homosexual relationships, although he shared contempt towards them alongside his contemporaries.

 the conceptions of homosexu[X]ty found in classical [Y]ic texts resemble the traditions of greco-roman antiquity rather than the modern understanding of sexual orientation.

 public attitudes toward homosexu[X]ty in the muslim world underwent a marked negative change starting from the 19th century through the global spread of [Y]ic fundament[X]st movements such as salafism and wahhabism, and the influence of the sexual notions and restrictive norms prevalent in europe at the time: a number of muslim-majority countries have retained criminal penalties for homosexual acts enacted under european colonial rule.

some scholars (both western and [Y]ic) argue that in the course of the quranic lot story, homosexu[X]ty in the modern sense is not addressed, but that the destruction of the "people of lut" was a result of breaking the ancient hospit[X]ty law and sexual violence, in this case the attempted rape of men.

classical [Y]ic jurists did not deal with homosexu[X]ty as a sexual orientation, since the latter concept is modern and has no match in traditional law, which dealt with it under the technical terms of liwat and zina.

" one scholar represents the conventional perspective by arguing that the qur'an "is very explicit in its condemnation of homosexu[X]ty leaving scarcely any loophole for a theological accommodation of homosexu[X]ty in [Y].

many muslim scholars have followed a "don't ask, don't tell" policy in regards to homosexu[X]ty in [Y], by treating the subject with passivity.

mohamed el-moctar el-shinqiti, director of the [Y]ic center of south plains in texas, has argued that "[even though] homosexu[X]ty is a grievous sin.

egyptian [Y]ist journ[X]st muhammad jalal kishk also found no punishment for homosexual acts prescribed in the quran, regarding the hadith that mentioned it as poorly attested.

" under this reading, [Y] can be described as "a religion that positively assesses diversity in creation and in human societies," allowing gay and lesbian muslims to view homosexu[X]ty as representing the "natural diversity in sexu[X]ty in human societies.

abdessamad dialmy in his 2010 article, sexu[X]ty and [Y], addressed "sexual norms defined by the sacred texts (koran and sunna).

an argument to prove that the abolishing of christianity in england may, as things now stand today, be attended with some inconveniences, and perhaps not produce those many good effects proposed thereby, commonly referred to as an argument against abolishing christianity, is a satirical essay by [X] defending christianity, and in particular, [Y], against contemporary assaults by its various opponents, including freethinkers, deists, antitrinitarians, atheists, socinians, and other so-called "dissenters.

[X] – american actress who converted to [Y]

 [X] is important in [Y] for his role in the events of the exodus, in which, according to the quran and [Y]ic belief, he preached with his elder brother, moses to the pharaoh of the exodus.

[X]'s significance in [Y], however, is not limited to his role as the helper of moses.

 [Y]ic tradition also accords [X] the role of a patriarch, as tradition records that the priestly descent came through [X]'s lineage, which included the entire house of amran.

 while neither the bible nor the quran mentions the genealogy of elijah, some scholars of [Y] believe he may have come from the priestly family of the prophet [X].

 in the wake of the egyptian revolution of 2011, the muslim brotherhood had been vocal about its support of the overthrow of then longtime president [X], in favor of [Y]ist president mohamed morsi, which was eventually replaced by abdel fattah el-sisi (supreme commander of the egyptian armed forces).

behind all the legal arguments advanced by both sides commentators saw a "raw contest for supremacy", a "duel between the brotherhood and the military", a "fight between the nation's oldest and most influential [Y]ist organization and appointees of the ousted president, [X]", and a fundamental conflict between "elected and unelected parts of the state".

 under [X], the commonly worn [Y]ic headscarfs were banned from official view, for example they could not be used by female television presenters.

 in 1985, egyptian leader [X] and the national assembly revised that code in order to try and take some of the heat off of [Y]ist anti-regime activists such as those in the muslim brotherhood by co-opting some of the [Y]ists' demands.

 in 2009, he spent some time in jail under the government of ousted egyptian president [X] due to his speeches against radical, fundamentalist sunni movements that harm [Y].

the prison was used to incarcerate [Y]ists and other political prisoners under the regime of [X] and after the egyptian revolution of 2011, several prominent muslim brotherhood activists were imprisoned there.

 egyptian [Y]ic jihad denied that it was the perpetrator of the attack, stating that it stopped using bombings as a method during the rule of [X].

 operating from its exile base in sudan, eij joined forces with the egyptian al-gama'a al-[Y]iyya and sudanese intelligence in an attempt to kill egyptian president [X] while he was in ethiopia for a conference of the organization of african unity.

at a conference on [X], an acquaintance of goldschmit, the french actor and theatrical director daniel mesguich, alerted him to the existence of tassinari's florio theory, and, for goldschmit, the bits of mystery of shakespeare's intimacy with jewish scriptures all fell into place: qua john florio, son of a man whose ancestors had been converts from [Y], shakespeare must indeed have been a crypto-jew and fluent in hebrew.

" he also expressed concern that the attacks would cause the "legitimate iraqi resistance" to lose its credibility in the eyes of the [Y]ic world" in 2018, the ams reaffirmed its opposition to foreign forces in iraq, while maintaining its denial of organizational links to al-qaeda despite chairman [X]'s inclusion on a terrorism list released by the dawa party-led government in iraq.

the myth that god created the world out of nothing – ex nihilo – is central today to [Y], christianity and islam, and the medieval jewish philosopher [X] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.

conservative [Y] both affirms belief in the world beyond (as referenced in the amidah and [X]' thirteen precepts of faith) while recognizing that human understanding is limited and we cannot know exactly what the world beyond consists of.

 [X], a centrally important medieval sage of [Y], lived at the time of the first emergence of kabbalah.

 rabbi yiḥyah founded yeshivot, rabbinical schools, and synagogues that featured a rationalist approach to [Y] based on the talmud and works of saadia gaon and [X] (rambam).

 in modern times, rationalists holding similar views as those of the dor de'ah movement have described themselves as "talmide ha-rambam" (disciples of [X]) rather than as being aligned with dor de'ah, and are more theologically aligned with the rationalism of modern orthodox [Y] than with orthodox Ḥasidic or Ḥaredi communities.

in his commentary on the mishnah (tractate sanhedrin, chapter 10), [X] formulates his "13 principles of faith"; and that these principles summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of [Y]:

 [X] asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of [Y] about which there is no disagreement.

 one of the best-known statements of rabbinic [Y] on monotheism is the second of [X]' 13 principles of faith:

belief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of [Y], and is one of [X]' 13 principles of faith.

 furthermore, kellner criticizes the assumption within orthodox [Y] that there is an "ontological divide between jews and gentiles", which he believes is contrary to what [X] thought and the torah teaches, stating that "gentiles as well as jews are fully created in the image of god".

 according to steven schwarzschild, [X]' position has its source in his adoption of aristotle's skeptical attitude towards the ability of reason to arrive at moral truths, and "many of the most outstanding spokesmen of [Y] themselves dissented sharply from" this position, which is "individual and certainly somewhat eccentric" in comparison to other jewish thinkers.

while mainstream rabbinic [Y] is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of [X] (c.

jews pray for the messianic age of peace every day in the shmoneh esreh in addition to faith in the coming of the messianic age constituting one of the thirteen core principles of faith in [Y], according to [X].

in [Y], issues of epistemology have been addressed by jewish philosophers such as saadiah gaon (882–942) in his book of beliefs and opinions; [X] (1135–1204) in his guide for the perplexed; samuel hugo berman, professor of philosophy at the hebrew university; joseph dov soloveitchik (1903–1993), talmudic scholar and philosopher; neil gillman, professor of philosophy at the jewish theological seminary of america, and elliot n.

 beliefs that god gave a "torah of truth" to moses (and the rest of the people), that moses was the greatest of the prophets, and that the law given to moses will never be changed, are three of the thirteen principles of faith of orthodox [Y] according to [X].

 in jacobs' and broyde's view, they were attracted by its glorification of man, its doctrine of immortality, and its ethical principles, which they saw as more in keeping with the spirit of talmudic [Y] than are those taught by the philosophers, and which was held in contrast to the view of [X] and his followers, who regarded man as a fragment of the universe whose immortality is dependent upon the degree of development of his active intellect.

at the same time, [X] - and other thinkers - recognizes   the paradox that will arise given (i) that [Y] simultaneously recognizes god's omniscience, and further (ii) the nature  of divine providence as understood in [Y].

 as noted, however, neither [X] nor his contemporaries viewed these principles as encompassing all of jewish belief, but rather as the core theological underpinnings of the acceptance of [Y].

 while defending [X] against hasdai and albo, he refused to accept dogmatic articles for [Y], criticizing any formulation as minimizing acceptance of all 613 mitzvot.

 in egypt, [X] resumed practicing [Y] openly only to be accused of apostasy.

 in talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in [Y], known as maaseh bereshith (the work of creation) and maaseh merkavah (the work of the chariot); [X] interprets these texts as referring to aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of torah.

 mendelssohn has been described as the "'third moses,' with whom begins a new era in [Y]," just as new eras began with moses the prophet and with moses [X].

some orthodox rationalists in israel take a "restorationist" approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify rabbinic [Y] and bring all jews, regardless of status or stream of [Y], closer to observance of halacha, mitzvot, kashrut and embrace of [X]' "13 principles of faith".

[X], one of [Y]'s most important theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why jesus was wrong to create christianity and why muhammad was wrong to create islam; he laments the pains jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant [Y] (in the case of christianity, called supersessionism).

orthodox [Y] maintains the 13 principles of faith as formulated by [X] in his introduction to chapter helek of the mishna torah.

 one famous muslim who converted to [Y] was ovadyah, famous from his contact with [X].

[X] endeavored to harmonize the philosophy of aristotle with [Y]; and to this end he composed the work, dalalat al-Ḥairin (guide for the perplexed)—known better under its hebrew title moreh nevuchim—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by jewish thinkers.

in a response, [X] discusses the relationship between [Y] and islam:

medieval, rationalist jewish philosophers (exponents of hakirah–rational "investigation" from first principles in support of [Y]), such as [X], describe biblical monotheism to mean that there is only one god, and his essence is a unique, simple, infinite unity.

as one of the towering figures in [Y] and the author of the mishneh torah commentary on the talmud, [X] also issued a landmark doctrinal response to the forced conversions of jews in the iberian peninsula by the almohads:

in his epistle on martyrdom, however, [X] suggested that the persecuted jew should publicly adopt islam while maintaining crypto-[Y] and not seek martyrdom unless forced to transgress jewish commandments in public.

 the jewish philosophers of the middle ages, such as [X], reconciled [Y] with greek philosophy.

 as a formative approach guidebook in [Y], the english translator of the first section, in his introduction, compares its position with [X]' guide for the perplexed, but contrasts the spiritual guidance aim of tanya with the philosophical aim of [X].

the jewish philosopher [X], who was heavily influenced by islamic and aristotelian thought, also set forth moderation as an ideal within [Y].

 setting aside the possible exception of the work of [X], it had a profound impact on the subsequent development of [Y], and has remained central to jewish religious tradition.

in the 12th century, the preeminent jewish scholar [X] codified core principles of modern [Y], writing "[god], the cause of all, is one.

[X] lamented the pains that jews felt as a result of new faiths that attempted to supplant [Y], specifically christianity and islam.

krauthammer's attachment to [Y] was strengthened through his study of [X] at mcgill university under rabbi david hartman.

cohen's most famous jewish works include: religion der vernunft aus den quellen des judentums (religion of reason out of the sources of [Y], 1919), deutschtum und judentum, die naechstenliebe im talmud, and die ethik des [X].

  this was a view shared by the pharisees and taught in the talmud and [X] (with the except of the element of faith in christ), but denied by (mostly gentile born) judaizers who taught conversion to [Y] as a requisite for salvation.

 joseph ber soloveitchik (1903–1993), distinguished rosh yeshiva of the rabbi isaac elchanan theological seminary and [X] school, author, posek, modern philosopher, regarded as a seminal figure by modern orthodox [Y]

 [X] writes that tikkun olam requires efforts in all three of the great "pillars" of [Y]: torah study, acts of kindness, and the ritual commandments.

rabbinic [Y]'s scholars, such as [X], write that people who deny the divine authority of the oral torah are to be considered among the heretics.

 [X]' codification of jewish law even contains a section entitled yesodei hatorah, which delineates the required beliefs of [Y].

 to restore what they believed to be a rational approach to [Y] rooted in authentic sources, including the talmud, saadia gaon and especially [X];

 furthermore, dor daim accept that in talmudic times there was a secret mystical tradition in [Y], known as maaseh bereshith (the work of creation) and maaseh merkavah (the work of the chariot); [X] interprets these as respectively referring to something similar to aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of torah.

 other segments of orthodox [Y] which share this perspective of the dor daim, while not necessarily rejecting the zohar itself, include most talmide ha-rambam (disciples of [X]), as well as portions of the modern orthodox community and others.

 this perspective is shared not only by non-dor dai disciples of rambam ([X]) but also by many in mainstream orthodox [Y].

dor daim are regarded as part of a wider trend within [Y] known as talmide ha-rambam (pupils of [X]), not necessarily confined to the yemenite community.

 [X] agonist: disenchantment and reenchantment in modern [Y] article by menachem kellner contrasting maimonidean with zoharic [Y].

 furthermore, kellner criticizes the assumption within orthodox [Y] that there is an "ontological divide between jews and gentiles", which he believes is contrary to what [X] thought and the torah teaches, stating that "gentiles as well as jews are fully created in the image of god".

in the same responsum, he concludes that if the ethiopian jewish community wished to return to rabbinic [Y], they would be received and welcomed into the fold, just as the karaites who returned to the teachings of the rabbanites in the time of rabbi abraham ben [X].

belief that at least portions of the oral torah were transmitted orally from god to moses on mount sinai during the exodus from egypt is a fundamental tenet of faith of orthodox [Y], and was recognized as one of the thirteen principles of faith by [X].

 laws of [Y] concerning wine from the torah and [X]’ code of jewish law

 while he accepts the conclusions of the kalam school (because of their consistency with [Y]), he disagrees with their methods and points out many perceived flaws in their arguments: “[X] exposes the weakness of these propositions, which he regards as founded not on a basis of positive facts, but on mere fiction .

 menachem kellner [X]' allegiances to science and [Y] the torah u-madda journal, volume 7, 1997, yeshiva university, pp.

the idea that god created the world out of nothing (creatio ex nihilo) has become central today to islam, christianity, and [Y] – indeed, the medieval jewish philosopher [X] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared – yet it is not found directly in genesis, nor in the entire hebrew bible.

 abu'l-barakāt, an older contemporary of [X], was originally known by his hebrew birth name  baruch ben malka and was given the name of nathanel by his pupil isaac ben ezra before his conversion from [Y] to islam later in his life.

  mendelssohn has been described as the "'third moses,' with whom begins a new era in [Y]," just as new eras began with moses the prophet and with moses [X].

 the discord between the followers of [X] and his opponents wrought most serious damage to the interests of [Y].

 influenced by the earlier rational success of jewish philosophy, especially the work of [X], in producing a systematic intellectual articulation of [Y], the ramak achieved the first accepted systemisation of kabbalah, based on its rational categorisation and study.

 in [Y], the heavenly realms could fulfill [X]' principle of faith in reward and punishment.

 this accomplishment was reserved for [X], who discussed the relevance of the philosophy of aristotle to [Y]; and to this end he composed his immortal work, "dalalat al-Ḥairin" (guide for the perplexed) —known better under its hebrew title "moreh nevuchim"—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by jewish thinkers.

 the first book in [X]' compendium of halakha, the mishneh torah, is entitled "madda"   - there, though, the term refers to knowledge of the fundamentals of [Y].

note that [X]' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, mystical streams of [Y]—thus, for example, rabbi isaiah horowitz, the shlah hakodosh (-1630) holds that "none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader" (shnei luchos habris, introduction).

 if [X] had intended to stem the further development of talmud study by reducing it to the form of a code, raavad felt it his duty to oppose such an attempt, as contrary to the free spirit of rabbinical [Y], which refuses to surrender blindly to authority.

raavad was thus an opponent to the codification of the halakha; but he was even more strongly opposed to the construction of a system of dogmas in [Y], particularly according to the method followed by [X], who often set up the concepts of the aristotelian philosophy as jewish theology.

alharizi was a rationalist, conveying the works of [X] and his approach to rationalistic [Y].

 today, many jewish people accept the theory of evolution and do not see it as incompatible with traditional [Y], reflecting the emphasis of prominent rabbis such as the vilna gaon and [X] on the ethical rather than factual significance of scripture.

 1190[X] writes the moreh nebukhim, or guide to the perplexed, using rationalism to reconcile [Y] with aristotle's laws of nature, and shloshah-asar ikkarim, the thirteen articles of faith.

 indeed, they argued that the biblical rule, that slaves should be freed for certain injuries, should actually only apply to slaves who had converted to [Y]; additionally, [X] argued that this manumission was real punishment of the owner, and therefore it could only be imposed by a court, and required evidence from witnesses.

[X], one of the foremost 12th-century rabbinical arbiters and philosophers, sees the relation of islam to [Y] as primarily theoretical.

 these were not slow to urge this messianic dogma of [X] as far as they might, to embarrass the defenders of [Y].

 ecstatic traditions were at a disadvantage for normative [Y], as they made classic meditation their central preoccupation; as with [X] the mitzvot jewish observances were a means to the end purpose of mystical or philosophical cleaving to god (or the active intellect).

 [Y], sufism, and the pietists of medieval egypt: a study of abraham [X] and his times.

 according to the rationalist stream of [Y] articulated by [X], which later came to dominate much of official traditional jewish thought, god is understood as the absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence.

 the general rule in [Y] is that for rituals which have an associated blessing, if one omitted the blessing, the ritual is still valid [see [X] laws of blessings 11:5]; as such, even if the shochet failed to recite the blessing before shechita, the slaughter is still valid and the meat is kosher.

[X] (1135–1204) was one of the greatest scholars on [Y] of the middle ages, and is arguably one of the most widely known scholars among the jewish people.

 by omitting the middle letter, the word is not written in full, thus eliminating the possibility of accidentally destroying the written name of god, which would violate one of the 613 mitzvot of [Y] (number 8 on [X]' list).

despite [X]' denunciation of hermetism, jewish scholars in the renaissance struggled to reconcile his beliefs with those of the proponents of hermetic thought within [Y].

" ever since then, [X] taught, whoever adopts [Y] is counted among the disciples of abraham.

haredi [Y] and chabad movement takes the writings of the [X] literally: the messiah is assigned to mission of completing the ingathering the exiles of israel.

 there is dispute amongst scholars as to whether [X] himself converted to islam in order to freely escape from almohad territory, and then reconverted back to [Y] in either the levant or in egypt.

birnbaum is also well known for his works of popular [Y]: his excerpted translation of [X] mishne torah, was one of the first into english; his "encyclopedia of jewish concepts" and "a treasury of [Y]" (an anthology excerpting over 70 classic works) were widely referenced.

a belief in a bodily resurrection of the dead, one of [X] thirteen principles of faith, is a normative belief of orthodox [Y] and a traditional belief of conservative [Y].

 it would be natural to infer from this proceeding, which divided [Y] into two hostile camps, that solomon had had a philosophical training which enabled him to recognize the import of [X]' ideas, and the contradictions existing between the latter's conception of [Y] and that of the talmud.

samuel david luzzatto argued that solomon, while a prominent talmudic authority and of pious, upright character, took up the quarrel with the best intentions but was unable to comprehend [X]' views correctly, and had no idea of a philosophical conception of [Y].

the shulchan aruch, a 16th-century text that was published after the writings of [X], and which is viewed by the majority of orthodox [Y] as being authoritative, expresses a different view on interest, stating that it is now allowable (when it was written) to lend on interest to non-jews.

 it was around this time that he augmented the dor deʻah movement in orthodox [Y], to counter the influence of lurianic kabbalah and restore the rational approach to [Y], such as is represented by the thought of [X] and sa'adiah gaon, and to encourage strict adherence to the halakha as formulated in the mishneh torah.

  in general, these skeptical views regard some or all of the "principles of faith," whatever these may be (see [X], albo), but historically jewish skepticism is directed either at (1) the existence of the god of [Y] or (2) the authenticity and veracity of the torah.

 communities where luria's thought holds less sway include many german and modern orthodox communities, groups carrying forward spanish and portuguese traditions, a sizable segment of baladi yemenite jews (see dor daim), and other groups that follow a form of torah [Y] based more on classical authorities like [X] and the geonim.

 overall, [Y] recommends moderation rather than total abstinence, a balance perhaps best represented by [X]' "golden middle way" between sensual luxury and tortured self-deprivation.

 in them he gave the tenets of [Y] in the style of [X]' thirteen principles of faith, and added "eleven philosophical objections against the dogma of the trinity.

in [Y], a similar hierarchy can be found in the entirely non-kabbalistic system of [X], who posits ten ranks of angels (from the different biblical terms for them), the lowest of which is ishim, literally "men".

according to the rationalist stream of [Y] articulated by [X], which later came to dominate much of official traditional jewish thought, god is understood as the absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being who is the creator deity and cause of all existence.

in the same responsum, he concludes that if the ethiopian jewish community wished to return to rabbinic [Y], they would be received and welcomed into the fold, just as the karaites who returned to the teachings of the rabbanites in the time of rabbi abraham ben [X].

laws of [Y] concerning insects from the torah and [X]’ code of jewish law

although conversion to [Y] was a possibility for slaves, rabbinic authorities [X] and karo discouraged it on the basis that jews were not permitted (in their time) to proselytize; slaveowners could enter into special contracts by which they agree not to convert their slaves.

 from 1926 to 1933 he was a member of the forschungsinstitut (research institute) of the akademie für die wissenschaft des judentums (academy for the science of [Y]) in berlin, working on books about [X] and gabirol, and serving as one of the editors of the akademieausgabe (academy edition) of a work on moses mendelssohn's collected writings (moses mendelssohn: gesammelte schriften).

the quranic verse on ezra appears in one of [X]'s discussions about the relationship between [Y] and islam where he says “…they [muslims] lie about us [jews], and falsely attribute to us the statement that god has a son.

one of the best-known statements of rabbinical [Y] on monotheism occurs in [X]' 13 principles of faith, second principle:

 alrashed became the object of much ridicule by the dor dai movement in [Y], which was intended to combat the influence of the zohar and restore the rational approach of [X] and the jewish law as codified by him.

 [X] considered jesus as a jewish renegade in revolt against [Y]; religion commanded the death of jesus and his students; and christianity was a religion attached to his name in a later period.

the rabbis of the talmud gave no reason for the prohibition, but later authorities, such as [X], opined that the law was connected to a prohibition of idolatry in [Y].

 [Y]'s rejection grew further after the islamic golden age in the tenth century, which [X] codified in the twelfth century, in his thirteen principles of jewish faith.

 in addition, the more right-wing groups within orthodox [Y] hold that all jews who reject the simple meaning of [X]'s 13 principles of jewish faith are heretics.

 after initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of [Y]ic scholars who feared pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, [X] secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in indonesia to adhere to pancasila as a fundamental principle.

 [X] had also attempted at consolidating pancasila as the only state ideology, which was also turned down by the fierce resistance of [Y]ic groups.

 under the [X] regime, containment of [Y] as a political ideology had led to all the [Y]ic parties forcibly unite under one government-supervised [Y]ic party, the united development party (ppp).

 certain [Y]ic organizations were incorporated by the [X] regime, most notably mui, ddii, and indonesian association of muslim intellectuals (icmi) to absorb the political [Y] for the regime's gain.

 the ban was lifted in 1988, and with [X] himself moving towards [Y] in the 1990s, dangdut became of the establishment.

 after the fall of [X], kammi become the political party prosperous justice party (pks), while nu and muhammadiyah chose to not involved in practical politics of winning elections and instead forming independent political parties which are aligned but independent of their [Y]ic organization, in the form of the national awakening party (pkb) and national mandate party (pan).

under [X] political [Y]ists were suppressed, and religious muslims carefully watched by the indonesian government.

 the christian general theo syafei, who also served under [X], spoke out against political [Y] coming to power in indonesia, and insulted the qur'an and [Y] in remarks which were described as [Y]ophobic.

 [X]'s imposition of pancasila as sole ideology caused protests from conservative [Y]ic groups which considered [Y]ic law (sharia) to be above any human conceptions.

 he undertook a much-publicized hajj pilgrimage in 1991, took up name of haji mohammad [X], started promoting [Y]ic values into society, and promoted the careers of [Y]ic-oriented generals (dubbed the "green generals").

 during this period of [X]'s cozying with [Y]ists, race riots against ethnic-chinese began to occur quite regularly, beginning with the april 1994 riot in medan.

 president abdurrahman wahid said the bombing was linked to his efforts to prosecute members of the [X] family and that tommy and his friend habib ali baagil of the [Y]ic defenders front (fpi) might be involved.

 by now, it was evident that laskar jihad, a radical [Y]ic militia, were being assisted by members of the military and it was apparent that they were financed by fuad bawazier, the last minister of finance to have served under [X].

 based on the record, it already existed around 1975 under the name of indonesian [Y]ic revolutionary board (indonesian: dewan revolusi [Y] indonesia, drii) an anti-[X] underground [Y]ic resistance movement by imran bin muhammad zein.

 however, the plan apparently backfired, as some of the veterans later returned to jihadism and [Y]ic extremism and sided against [X].

concerning the political expansion of [Y] after the resignation of [X], political parties were again permitted to declare an ideology other than pancasila.

 [X] also made an effort to "de-[Y]icise" the government, by maintaining a large proportion of christians in his cabinet.

" the court blamed the rise of anti-christian sentiment on [X] consorting with militant [Y]ic groups in the 1990s in order to maintain his power, noting that he had "purged his cabinet and army of christians and replaced them with fundamentalist muslims", and adding that support and protection for violent [Y]ic militia such as laskar jihad by the military and political elite had continued since [X]'s exit from power.

 he viewed [Y] as an intrinsic part of indonesian culture and was disappointed by the sukarno and [X] governments' handling of the religion.

 after independence, natsir became increasingly disheartened by how sukarno, and later [X], dealt with religion, writing in the early 1970s that indonesia was treating [Y] as one would treat "a cat with ring-worms ".

in the early 1990s, [X] moved his public identity and government considerably towards [Y].

 as opposed to traditional [Y]ic organizations in indonesia such as the nahdatul ulama (nu), icmi supported [X]'s regime in turn for considerable influence in policy-making and administration.

 another prominent member was amien rais who would later become a major opponent of the [X] regime and chief of muhammadiyah, reputedly the largest [Y]ic organization in the world.

 icmi's ranks were believed to be infiltrated by [Y]ists who sought to exercise political power through the [X] regime and consequently it aroused considerable opposition amongst secular indonesians and non-indonesian muslims.

 there was also an ascendance of [Y]ist movements after the democratic transition, formerly suppressed by the [X] regime.

[X]'s new order regime wanted to ensure its continued rule by destroying the old political system, and it put pressure on the parties to merge into two groups, one of [Y]ic parties and the other of nationalist and christian parties.

 although the fpi was established by hard-line [Y]ic scholars, they supported right-wing elements in politics and the military, which supported former president [X] and tried to prevent this from coming to light.

 [X]'s actions were based on his view of the pni, which he saw as a natural vehicle for the expression of the political aspirations of the non-[Y]ic masses of java and as an important counter-balance towards the muslim parties, such as parmusi, and the nahdlatul ulama.
