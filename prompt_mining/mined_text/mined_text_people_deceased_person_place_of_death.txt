a[X]id ba[Y]ters 

an a[X]id ba[Y]ter is an instrument used for measuring air pressure as a method that does not involve liquid.

 invented in 1844 by french scientist lucien vidi, the a[X]id ba[Y]ter uses a small, flexible metal box called an a[X]id cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper.

a[X]id ba[Y]ters are used in scuba diving.

 temperature compensation of an a[X]id ba[Y]ter is accomplished by including a bi-metal element in the mechanical linkages.

  a[X]id ba[Y]ters sold for domestic use typically have no compensation under the assumption that they will be used within a controlled room temperature range.

a[X]id ba[Y]ters have a mechanical adjustment that allows the equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without further adjustment if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude.

 setting an a[X]id ba[Y]ter is similar to resetting an analog clock that is not at the correct time.

 though somewhat rare, a few a[X]id ba[Y]ters intended for monitoring the weather are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude.
