 the newly created republic of [Y] then joined the [X]n federation, while chechnya declared full independence from moscow in 1993 as the chechen republic of ichkeria (chri).

limited fighting occurred in the neighbouring small [X]n republic of [Y], mostly when [X]n commanders sent troops over the border in pursuit of chechen fighters, while as many as 200,000 refugees (from chechnya and the conflict in north ossetia) strained [Y]'s already weak economy.

 undisciplined [X]n soldiers were also reported to be committing murders, rapes, and looting in [Y] (in an incident partially witnessed by visiting [X]n duma deputies, at least nine ingush civilians and an ethnic bashkir soldier were murdered by apparently drunk [X]n soldiers; earlier, drunken [X]n soldiers killed another [X]n soldier, five ingush villagers and even [Y]'s health minister).

 in 1992, chechen and ingush leaders signed an agreement splitting the joint chechen–ingush republic in two, with [Y] joining the [X]n federation and chechnya remaining independent.

 the [X]n air strikes were reported to have forced at least 100,000 chechens to flee their homes to safety; the neighbouring region of [Y] was reported to have appealed for united nations aid to deal with tens of thousands of refugees.

 on 2 october 1999, [X]'s ministry of emergency situations reported that 78,000 people had fled the air strikes in chechnya; most of them went to [Y], where they were arrived at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day.

 this meant that when checheno-[Y] declared independence from [X] in november 1991, the ingush would decide to withdraw, not because they did not want independence, but because a state boundary splitting them from prigorodny would put it out of their reach.

by the next summer, checheno-[Y] was dissolved; a number of chechen and ingush placenames were replaced with [X]n ones; mosques and graveyards were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical chechen texts was near complete (leaving the world depleted of what was more or less the only source of central caucasian literature and historical texts except for sparse texts about the chechens, ingush, etc.

 the goal of this (and, indeed, adding shelkovskaya and naursky to checheno-[Y]) was to try to forcefully assimilate the chechens by keeping them away from the mountains and reminders of "their ancient struggles", and to keep them mixed in with supposedly more loyal [X]ns so they could not rebel without a counter-force present.

in 1989, for the very first time, a non-[X]n, a chechen, was appointed to be the ruler of checheno-[Y] - doku zavgayev.

 two days later, on november 27, the supreme soviet declared its agreement with this by declaring checheno-[Y]'s sovereignty and adding that it would negotiate with [X] on equal footing, raising chechnya to the level of georgia, azerbaijan and armenia - that is, a union republic.

 on the basis of the plombières agreement, the kingdom of [Y] ceded savoy and nice to france, an event that caused the niçard exodus, that was the emigration of a quarter of the niçard italians to [X].

 teano was the site of the famous meeting of 26 october 1860 between giuseppe garibaldi and victor emmanuel ii, last king of [Y], in which garibaldi shook victor emanuel's hand and hailed him as king of [X]; thus, garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of italian unity under a monarchy.

 cavour agreed to include garibaldi's southern [X] allowing it to join the union with the kingdom of [Y] in 1860.

 the constitutional law of the kingdom of [Y] the albertine statute of 1848, was extended to the whole kingdom of [X] in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new state, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting.

 the swamps and ponds that in the past covered vast flat areas of [X], have largely been dried up in recent centuries; the few remaining wetlands, such as the comacchio valleys in emilia-romagna or the stagno di cagliari in [Y], are protected natural environments.

 [X], whose territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region, is located in southern europe and comprises the long, boot-shaped italian peninsula crossed by the apennines, the southern side of alps, the large plain of the po valley and some islands including sicily and [Y].

 including islands, [X] has a coastline of  on the adriatic sea, ionian sea, tyrrhenian sea, ligurian sea, sea of [Y] and strait of sicily.

 including islands, [X] has a coastline of  on the adriatic sea, ionian sea, tyrrhenian sea, ligurian sea, sea of [Y] and strait of sicily.

insular [X] is made up of [Y], sicily and numerous smaller islands, scattered or grouped into archipelagos in the seas that bathe the coasts of the peninsula.

the swamps and ponds that in the past covered vast flat areas of [X], in recent centuries have been largely dried up; the few remaining wetlands, such as the valli di comacchio in emilia-romagna or the stagno di cagliari in [Y], are protected as very precious natural environments.

 however, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the po valley (that accounts for almost half of the national population) in northern [X] and the metropolitan areas of rome and naples in central and southern [X], while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of basilicata, the alps and apennines highlands, and the island of [Y].

prior to unification, the economy of the many italian statelets was overwhelmingly agrarian; however, the agricultural surplus produced what historians call a "pre-industrial" transformation in north-western [X] starting from the 1820s, that led to a diffuse, if mostly artisanal, concentration of manufacturing activities, especially in piedmont-[Y] under the liberal rule of the count of cavour.

 to illustrate, the ex-papal state (central [X]) took on the 10%, the ex-kingdom of two sicilies (southern [X]) the 40%, and the rest of the state (ex-kingdom of [Y], northern [X]) the 21%.

 the corps was instituted in 1814 by king victor emmanuel i of savoy with the aim of providing the kingdom of [Y] with a police corps; it is therefore older than [X] itself.

 by 1860, most of [X] had been unified under the king of [Y] victor emmanuel ii and under law 132 of 28 july 1861 the metric system became the official system of measurement throughout the kingdom.

 this included areas such as southern [X], the island of [Y], the pontine marshes, the lower regions of coastal etruria and the city of rome along the tiber.

monti, [Y], [X], a comune and town

 the pope promoted peace in [X] by allying himself with the normans, orchestrating the defeat of the saracens in [Y] and subjugating the crescentii.

 there were three main military theatres in the war: [X], where hannibal defeated the roman legions repeatedly, with occasional subsidiary campaigns in sicily, [Y] and greece; iberia, where hasdrubal, a younger brother of hannibal, defended the carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success until moving into [X]; and africa, where the war was decided.

lenition of post-vocalic /p t k/ is widespread as an allophonic phonetic realization in [X] below the la spezia-rimini line, including corsica and most of [Y].

dialects of southern [X], [Y] and corsica 

the [Y]n-type vowel system is also found in a small region belonging to the  (also known as lausberg zone; compare ) of southern [X], in southern basilicata, and there is evidence that the romanian-type "compromise" vowel system was once characteristic of most of southern [X], although it is now limited to a small area in western basilicata centered on the castelmezzano dialect, the area being known as , the german word for 'outpost'.

the greatest variety of vowel systems outside of southern [X] is found in corsica, where the italo-western type is represented in most of the north and center and the [Y]n type in the south, as well as a system resembling the sicilian vowel system (and even more closely the carovignese system) in the cap corse region; finally, in between the italo-western and [Y]n system is found, in the taravo region, a unique vowel system that cannot be derived from any other system, which has reflexes like [Y]n for the most part, but the short high vowels of latin are uniquely reflected as mid-low vowels.

 a few other languages have official recognition on a regional or otherwise limited level; for instance, asturian and aragonese in spain; mirandese in portugal; friulian, [Y]n and franco-provençal in [X]; and romansh in switzerland.

 however some languages of [X] (italian, [Y]n, sicilian, and numerous other varieties of central and southern [X]) do have long consonants like , etc.

 [Y], southern [X]).

ch: used in italian, romance languages in [X], corsican, romanian, romansh and [Y]n to represent  before e or i (including yod );  in occitan, spanish, astur-leonese and galician;  or  in romansh before a, o or u; and  in most other languages.

gh: used in italian, romance languages in [X], corsican, romanian, romansh and [Y]n to represent  before e or i (including yod ), and in galician for the voiceless pharyngeal fricative  (not standard sound).

 in 1997, [Y]n, along with other languages spoken on the island, was recognized by regional law as an official language of [Y], and in 1999, [Y]n and eleven other "historical linguistic minorities" of [X] (, as defined by the legislator) were similarly recognized as such by national law (specifically, law no.

 since the byzantines were all intent on reconquering southern [X] and sicily, which had fallen to the muslims, their attention on [Y] was neglected and communications broke down with constantinople; this spurred the former byzantine province of [Y] to become progressively more autonomous from the byzantine oecumene (greek: οἰκουμένη), and eventually attain independence.

 the exceptionality of the [Y]n situation, which in this sense constitutes a unique case throughout the latin-speaking europe, consists in the fact that any official text was written solely in [Y]n from the very beginning and completely excluded latin, unlike what was happening – and would continue to happen – in france, [X] and iberia at the same time; latin, although co-official, was in fact only used in documents concerning relations with the european continent.

 the first volume of comparative [Y]n dialectology was produced in 1786 by the catalan jesuit andres febres, known in [X] and [Y] by the pseudonym of , who returned from lima where he had first published a book of mapuche grammar in 1764.

 however, even when the island became part of the kingdom of [X] under victor emmanuel ii in 1861, [Y]'s distinct culture from the now unified mainland made it an overall neglected province within the newly proclaimed unitary nation state.

 unlike the other infantry brigades of [X], sassari's conscripts were only [Y]ns (including many officers).

 sergio salvi's description of the [Y]ns as a "forbidden nation" in [X] further contributed to the linguistic question gaining more notoriety at the national level.

eventually, sustained activism made possible the ratification by [X] of the european framework convention for the protection of national minorities in 1998, which would be followed in 1999 by the formal recognition of twelve minority languages ([Y]n, albanian, catalan, german, greek, slovenian, croatian, french, franco-provençal, friulian, ladin and occitan) through the framework law no.

 the effects of the public institutions' rejection of the local culture and idiom had a particularly strong impact on the [Y]n population after the unification of [X], and especially with the institution of the national school system.

a number of other factors like a considerable immigration flow from mainland [X], the interior rural exodus to urban areas, where [Y]n is spoken by a much lower percentage of the population, and the use of italian as a prerequisite for jobs and social advancement actually hinder any policy set up to promote the language.

a bill proposed by the cabinet of the former italian prime minister mario monti would have further lowered the protection level of [Y]n, distinguishing between the so-called "national minorities", speaking languages protected by international agreements (german, slovenian, french) and the "linguistic minorities" whose language is not spoken in any state other than [X] (all the other ethno-linguistic groups, including [Y]n).

although there is still not an option to teach [Y]n on the island itself, let alone in [X], some language courses are instead sometimes available in germany (universities of stuttgart, munich, tübingen, mannheim etc.

at present, the [Y]n-speaking community is the least protected one in [X], despite being the largest minority language group officially recognized by the state.

 in 2017, a 60-hour [Y]n language course was introduced for the first time in [Y] and [X] at the university of cagliari, although such a course had been already available in other universities abroad.

 non-[Y]n) in that they would be "an italian dialect, much more tuscan in fact than the vast majority of [X]'s dialects themselves".

 as head of the rising house of habsburg during the first half of the 16th century, his dominions in europe extending from germany to northern [X] with direct rule over the austrian hereditary lands and the burgundian low countries, and a unified spain with its southern italian kingdoms of naples, sicily, and [Y].

 like the south of [X] and [Y], immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of [X] because workers tend to head to northern [X] instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities.

this was part of a secret agreement (the plombières agreement) brokered between the french emperor napoleon iii and the count camillo of cavour (prime minister of [Y] at that time) that allowed the final steps in the process of unification of [X].

 for seventeen years, the two states struggled for supremacy, primarily in [X] and iberia, but also on the islands of sicily and [Y] and, towards the end of the war, in north africa.

 there were three main military theatres during the war: [X], where the carthaginian general hannibal repeatedly defeated the roman legions, with occasional subsidiary campaigns in sicily, [Y] and greece; iberia, where hasdrubal, a younger brother of hannibal, defended the carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success until moving into [X]; and africa, where the war was decided.

 other filming locations used were in central and southern [X], such as the parks of valle del treja (between rome and viterbo), the area of camposecco (next to camerata nuova, characterized by a karst topography), the hills around castelluccio, the area around the gran sasso mountain, and the tivoli's quarries and [Y].

[Y]'s indigenous language and algherese catalan are referred to by both the regional and national law as two of [X]'s twelve officially recognized linguistic minorities, albeit gravely endangered, while the regional law provides some measures to recognize and protect the aforementioned as well as the island's other minority languages (the corsican-influenced sassarese and gallurese, and finally tabarchino ligurian).

the first people to settle in [Y] during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came from continental europe; paleolithic inhabitation of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in oliena's corbeddu cave; during the mesolithic era some populations, particularly from present-day tyrrhenian coast of [X], managed to move to northern [Y] via corsica.

 the territory then was divided between the republic of pisa, the della gherardesca family from [X], and the [Y]n judicates of arborea and gallura.

with the perfect fusion in 1848, the confederation of states powered by the savoyard kings of [Y] became a unitary and constitutional state and moved to the italian wars of independence for the unification of [X], that were led for thirteen years.

 in 1861, being [X] united by a debated war campaign, the parliament of the kingdom of [Y] decided by law to change its name and the title of its king to kingdom of [X] and king of [X].

 from 1850 onward, taxes more than doubled in [Y], which compounded the already severe financial hardships facing the islanders, due to the italo-french tariff war: between 1885 and 1897, the [Y]ns saw their land being confiscated more than the rest of [X] combined as a result of tax evasion.

in 1847, under king charles albert, all the administrative differences between [Y] and the italian mainland were abolished through the so-called perfect fusion: this manoveur had been presented as the only possible way to grant equal rights to all inhabitants of the kingdom, which would become a unitary state and the basic legislation of the future united [X] as well.

with the unification of [X] in 1861, the kingdom of [Y] became the kingdom of [X].

 operation mincemeat was an elaborate diversion implemented by the allies to persuade the axis's intelligence that their planned invasion of southern europe would take place in the balkans and [X] and would feature an invasion of [Y].

the war ended in [Y] in september 1943, with the withdrawal of the wehrmacht to corsica following the surrender of [X] to the allies under the armistice of cassibile, and the island, together with southern [X], became free.

in 1946 more than 60% of [Y]ns voted in favour of monarchy, just as much as in southern [X], but a few days later [X] became a republic.

 in the 1950s and 1960s many [Y]ns migrated to northern and central [X] (lombardy, piedmont, liguria, tuscany and rome) and the rest of europe (mostly in germany, france and belgium) but also from the interior of the island to the coastal cities of cagliari, olbia and sassari.

 even now, around 60% of all italian and us military installations in [X] are on [Y], whose area is less than one-tenth of all the italian territory and whose population is little more than the 2,5%; furthermore, they comprise over 35.

soon, charles albert, the king of [Y] (who ruled piedmont and savoy), urged by the venetians and milanese to aid their cause, decided this was the moment to unify [X] and declared war on austria (first italian independence war).

[Y] annexed lombardy from austria; it later occupied and annexed the united provinces of central [X], consisting of the grand duchy of tuscany, the duchy of parma, the duchy of modena and reggio and the papal legations on 22 march 1860.

 [Y] handed savoy and nice over to france at the treaty of turin, a decision that was the consequence of the plombières agreement, on 24 march 1860, an event that caused the niçard exodus, which was the emigration of a quarter of the niçard italians to [X].

thus, by early 1860, only five states remained in [X]—the austrians in venetia, the papal states (now minus the legations), the new expanded kingdom of piedmont-[Y], the kingdom of the two sicilies, and san marino.

 the new kingdom of [X] was structured by renaming the old kingdom of [Y] and annexing all the new provinces into its structures.

 the austrians demanded the disarmament of piedmont-[Y] first, and sent a fleet with thirty thousand soldiers to reinforce their garrisons in [X].

 napoleon promised to send two hundred thousand soldiers to help one hundred thousand soldiers from piedmont-[Y] to force the austrians out of northern [X]; in return, france would receive the county of nice and savoy provided that their populations would agree in a referendum.

 the alliance successfully fought and defeated the franco-spanish "party of the two crowns", and the subsequent treaty of utrecht and rastatt pass control of much of [X] (milan, naples and [Y]) from spain to austria, while sicily was ceded to the duchy of savoy.

at the end of the 18th century, [X] was almost in the same political conditions as in the 16th century; the main differences were that austria had replaced spain as the dominant foreign power after the war of spanish succession (though the war of the polish succession resulted in the re-installment of the spanish in the south, as the house of bourbon-two sicilies), and that the dukes of savoy (a mountainous region between [X] and france) had become kings of [Y] by increasing their italian possessions, which now included [Y] and the north-western region of piedmont.

this situation was shaken in 1796, when the french army of [X] under napoleon invaded [X], with the aims of forcing the first coalition to abandon [Y] (where they had created an anti-revolutionary puppet-ruler) and forcing austria to withdraw from [X].

 the resulting congress of vienna (1814) restored a situation close to that of 1795, dividing [X] between austria (in the north-east and lombardy), the kingdom of [Y], the kingdom of the two sicilies (in the south and in sicily), and tuscany, the papal states and other minor states in the centre.

 garibaldi led the italian republican drive for unification in southern [X], but the northern italian monarchy of the house of savoy in the kingdom of piedmont-[Y] whose government was led by camillo benso, count of cavour, also had the ambition of establishing a united italian state.

 on the basis of the plombières agreement, the kingdom of [Y] ceded savoy and nice to france, an event that caused the niçard exodus, that was the emigration of a quarter of the niçard italians to [X].

 the practice of the [X]n states—for example, new south wales and [Y]—has been, when legislating to repeal some imperial statutes so far as they still applied in [X], to provide that imperial statutes concerning the royal succession remain in force.

 in melbourne, [Y], in 1858, in a move that would help to shape [X]n football in its formative years, private schools (then termed "public schools" in accordance with english nomenclature) began organising football games inspired by precedents at english public schools.

 another theory, first proposed in 1983, posits that wills, having grown up amongst aboriginal people in [Y], may have seen or played the aboriginal ball game of marn grook, and incorporated some of its features into early [X]n football.

football became organised in south [X] in 1860 with the formation of the adelaide football club, the oldest football club in [X] outside [Y].

 it devised its own rules, and, along with other adelaide-based clubs, played a variety of codes until 1876, when they agreed to uniformly adopt most of the [Y]n rules, with south [X]n football pioneer charles kingston noting their similarity to "the old adelaide rules".

 the south [X]n football association (safa), the sport's first governing body, formed on 30 april 1877, firmly establishing [Y]n rules as the preferred code in that colony.

as clubs began touring the colonies in the late 1870s, the sport spread to new south wales, and in 1879, the first intercolonial match took place in melbourne between [Y] and south [X].

 in order to standardise the sport across [X], delegates representing the football associations of south [X], tasmania, [Y] and queensland met in 1883 and updated the code.

 new rules such as holding the ball led to a "golden era" of fast, long-kicking and high-marking football in the 1880s, a time which also saw players such as george coulthard achieve superstardom, as well as the rise of professionalism, particularly in [Y] and western [X], where the code took hold during a series of gold rushes.

 although clubs from other states were at times invited, the final was almost always between the premiers from the two strongest state competitions of the time—south [X] and [Y]—with adelaide hosting most of the matches at the request of the safa/sanfl.

 between 1976 and 1987, the anfc, and later the [X]n football championships (afc) ran a night series, which invited clubs and representative sides from around the country to participate in a knock-out tournament parallel to the premiership seasons, which [Y]n sides still dominated.

 this instantly broke [Y]'s stranglehold over state titles and western [X] and south [X] began to win more of their games against [Y].

 in the late 1980s, due to the poor financial standing of many of the [Y]n clubs, and a similar situation existing in western [X] in the sport, the vfl pursued a more national competition.

the vfl changed its name to the [X]n football league (afl) for the 1990 season, and over the next decade, three non-[Y]n clubs gained entry: adelaide (1991), fremantle (1995) and the sanfl's port adelaide (1997), the only pre-existing club outside [Y] to join the league.
