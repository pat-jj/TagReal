 the [Y] were an already large state north of china, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [X] suddenly united them under the eight banners—armies that the opposing families were organized into.

 as early as 1655, in the memoir of qing dynasty, volume: emperor [X] (), it writes: "(in 1631) as [Y] ministers do not comprehend the han language, each ministry shall create a new position to be filled up by han official who can comprehend the national language.

 around 1612, [X] renamed his clan aisin gioro ("golden gioro" in the [Y] language), both to distinguish his family from other gioro lines and to allude to an earlier dynasty that had been founded by jurchens, the jin ("golden") dynasty that had ruled northern china from 1115 to 1234.

 in the early qing era, [X] and huangtaiji categorised [Y] and han ethnic identity within the eight banners based on culture, lifestyle and language, instead of ancestry or genealogy.

 after a 1623 revolt, [X] came to mistrust his nikan ([Y]: , means "han people") followers so hong taiji began their assimilation into the country and government.

 he was the youngest of the sixteen sons of eidu (1562–1621), who had been a close associate of [Y] patriarch [X].

 the [Y]s scored successive victories, the most decisive being the battle of sarhu in which [X] defeated ming dynasty and korean troops that were far superior in numbers and armaments.

li yongfang's rewards for surrendering fushun to the jurchens and defecting included promotion in rank, [X]'s granddaughter as a wife, battling along with [X] and induction into the jin aristocracy as a chinese frontiersman, which was different from how [X] handled both the han transfrontiersmen who assimilated into [Y] identity and captured han bondservants.
