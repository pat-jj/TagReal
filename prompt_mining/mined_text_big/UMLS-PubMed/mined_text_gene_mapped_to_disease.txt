In contrast to classic [X] , harboring [Y] genetic fusions , YWHAE-FAM22 [X] display high-grade histologic features , a distinct gene-expression profile , and a more aggressive clinical course .

Immunohistochemically , the high-grade round cell component of all YWHAE-FAM22 [X] demonstrated diffuse -LRB- > / = % -RRB- moderate to strong nuclear cyclin D1 staining , and this diffuse positivity was not seen in ESSs with [Y] and equivalent genetic rearrangements or in low-grade [X] with no demonstrable genetic rearrangements .

The tumor cells showed large nuclei with irregular nuclear contours and significant mitotic activity -LRB- > mitoses/10 HPF -RRB- in addition to focal tumor necrosis , in contrast to [Y] [X] , which lacked a nested growth pattern , were composed of cells with small round/oval nuclei , and typically had < MF/10 HPF .

Clinically , of patients with YWHAE-FAM22 [X] presented with FIGO stages II to III disease , in contrast to only of patients with [Y] [X] presenting with stages II to III disease -LRB- P < -RRB- .

Tumors with YWHAE-FAM22 rearrangements constitute a distinct group of [X] , which is associated with high-grade morphology and aggressive clinical behavior compared to [Y] [X] .

Thus , their distinction from typical [Y] [X] is important for prognostic and therapeutic purposes .

Evolution of a juxtapapillary von Hippel-Lindau tumour examined by optical PURPOSE : The aim was to report the evolution of a case of von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- juxtapapillary retinal capillary [X] -LRB- RCH -RRB- by optical coherence tomography -LRB- OCT3 -RRB- .

CASE REPORT : The progress of a man suffering from [Y] disease with a juxtapapillary [X] and a small peripheral lesion was followed for months with fundus photographs and OCT of the optic nerve head using the optic nerve head rim volume , ranging from to mm -LRB- -RRB- .

In addition extraparaganglial tumors are frequent and include medullary thyroid carcinoma in MEN2 or renal cancer or neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer as well as [X] of the retina and the central nervous system in [Y] .

We present an unusual case of von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease that had adrenal and cerebellar [X] with multiple renal cysts , and a review of the literature .

Based on this , the patient was screened for possible features of [Y] , which revealed cerebellar [X] and multiple renal cysts with angiomatous lesion .

A mutation at IVS1 + of the von Hippel-Lindau gene resulting in intron BACKGROUND : Von Hippel-Lindau disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing the patient to a variety of malignant and benign neoplasms , most frequently [X] , renal cell carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , and pancreatic tumors .

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by renal cysts , retinal angiomas , central nervous system [X] , and pancreatic cysts .

In addition , recent advances in the molecular genetics of this disorder are providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of tumourigenesis in [Y] disease and in more common nonfamilial neoplasms such as clear cell renal carcinoma and central nervous system [X] .

[Y] is a rare tumor syndrome characterized by certain types of nervous system tumors -LRB- cerebellar and spinal [X] as well as retinal angiomas -RRB- , in conjunction with bilateral renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas .

In addition , somatic Inactivation of the [Y] gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and [X] .

Renal cell carcinomas , [X] , and pheochromocytomas , either VHL-related or sporadic , demonstrated positive staining for the [Y] protein , which suggests that the antibody also recognizes the mutated [Y] protein .

Due to recurrent [X] , a29-year-old patient without familial history of [Y] disease was diagnosed to be at risk for the disease .

Localization of expression by in situ Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- tumour suppressor gene is responsible not only for [Y] disease , but also for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar [X] .

Germline mutations in [Y] patients , as well as somatic mutations in different tumors , including [X] , have been identified , its ability to act as a tumor suppressor in vivo has been confirmed , and interaction with transcription factors Elongin B and C leading to inhibition of transcriptional elongation has been demonstrated .

The mechanism underlying neovascularization and cyst formation in [X] and how this is linked to inactivation of the [Y] tumor suppressor gene is not known .

It is believed that inactivation of both alleles of [Y] tumor suppressor gene is essential in the tumorigenic processes in [X] associated with [Y] disease .

Here , we analyzed cases of primary sporadic [X] for somatic mutations of [Y] gene with single strand conformational polymorphism analyses of the tumor DNAs .

Our results suggest that mutations of [Y] tumor suppressor gene are involved in the development of at least % of sporadic central nervous system [X] .

Chromosome allele loss was found in four tumour types -LRB- RCC , [X] , phaeochromocytoma and pancreatic tumour -RRB- suggesting a common mechanism of tumourigenesis in all types of tumour in [Y] disease .

In the patient with the chemodectoma , a cerebellar [X] became manifest yr after his initial diagnosis with pheochromocytoma , leading only then to a clinical diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Mutations in the [Y] tumor suppressor gene and associated lesions in families von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to retinal , cerebellar and spinal [X] , renal cell carcinoma -LRB- RCC -RRB- , pheochromocytoma and pancreatic tumors .

The current study is the first to describe a case of [Y] disease with lateral ventricular [X] and subsequent pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , bilateral renal cysts and renal cell carcinoma .

Von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with a predisposition to develop a wide variety of lesions : retinal , cerebellar , spinal and medullar [X] , renal cell carcinomas , phaeochromocytomas , and renal , pancreatic and epididymal cysts are the most frequent manifestations of the disease .

Third , phenotypically , we observed that , in our population of East Asian patients with [Y] syndrome , the incidence of retinal capillary [X] was lower , whereas the incidence of renal cell carcinoma was higher .

Autocrine/Paracrine Erythropoietin Signaling Associated With Symptomatic von INTRODUCTION : Von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease is an autosomal dominant neoplastic disorder leading to formation of multiple central nervous system [X] -LRB- HBs -RRB- .

Furthermore , genetic testing for [Y] is indicated in some individuals with seemingly sporadic VHL-related tumor types , as < / = % of pheochromocytoma or early-onset renal cell carcinoma and < / = % of CNS [X] harbor germline [Y] mutations without a family history or additional features of [Y] disease .

[Y] disease is characterized by malignant and benign tumors in a few specific tissues , including ccRCC , [X] and pheochromocytoma .

Central nervous system -LRB- CNS -RRB- manifestations of [Y] include craniospinal [X] and endolymphatic sac tumors -LRB- ELSTs -RRB- .

Although early sign/symptom formation is the primary indication for resection of craniospinal [X] , radiographic discovery -LRB- asymptomatic and symptomatic -RRB- of ELSTs can be an indication for resection of ELSTs in [Y] patients .

Bulbar dysfunction and aspiration pneumonia due to a brainstem [X] : A woman with a history of von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease , a rare inherited neoplasia syndrome , presented acutely to hospital with a productive cough , symptoms of respiratory tract infection and odynophagia -LRB- painful swallowing -RRB- .

The aim of this study was to explore the value of OCTA in imaging retinal [X] and monitoring laser treatment in patients with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease .

OCTA may help to distinguish [X] and other lesions in [Y] disease , especially after treatment and allows the differentiation from harmless non-vascular lesions in questionable cases .

Loss of Quiescence in von Hippel-Lindau [X] is Associated with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients develop multiple central nervous system [X] -LRB- HB -RRB- .

In [Y] patients , we resected quiescent [X] -LRB- Q-HB -RRB- that were en-route during surgical access to symptomatic [X] -LRB- S-HB -RRB- , for matched tumor analysis .

Concomitant presence of [Y] disease is observed in less than half of the patients with purely extradural spinal nerve root [X] .

CASE REPORT : We report a case of a female patient of years diagnosed [Y] and intervened on several occasions by cerebral [X] and renal carcinomas .

Infratentorial craniospinal irradiation for von Hippel-Lindau : a retrospective Patients with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- syndrome with diffuse CNS [X] have morbidity related to their disease and require a lifetime of surgical resections .

For the first time , we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy -LRB- ICSRT -RRB- for [Y] patients with CNS [X] .

Consecutive [Y] patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of [X] were included if they received ICSRT .

Two pediatric patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease type : from patient to Von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor susceptibility disease characterized by the development of [X] of the brain , spinal cord and retina ; pheochromocytomas and renal cell carcinoma .

Long-term use of intravitreal bevacizumab -LRB- avastin -RRB- for the treatment of von Retinal [X] are the most common manifestation of Von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease -LSB- -RSB- .

[Y] loss-of-function mutations result in organ-specific tumors , such as [X] of the central nervous system and renal cell carcinoma , both untreatable with conventional chemotherapies .

Patients with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease as well as sporadic [X] were included .

We showed that [Y] is required for cell survival in medullary -LRB- [X] -RRB- but not papillary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- PTC -RRB- cells .

In only of the sporadic [X] we were able to detect a [Y] mutation .

Children with clinically obvious [X] belong to MEN or families , related to [Y] mutations .

PATIENTS : Patients with [X] in remission -LRB- n = -RRB- or in persistence -LRB- n = -RRB- , [Y] gene mutations carriers -LRB- n = -RRB- , patients with nodular goiter -LRB- n = -RRB- , and healthy volunteers -LRB- n = -RRB- were submitted to pentagastrin and Ca -LRB- mg/kg -RRB- tests .

The aims of this study were to describe all known [Y] positive MEN patients diagnosed in Norway and to evaluate the clinical course of [X] , as well as its predictive and prognostic factors .

Increased amount of knowledge about the role of the [Y] gene and its protein product in FAP play an important role in revealing the molecular nature of [X] tumors .

CTNNB1 genotyping and [Y] screening in pediatric [X] tumors : a proposed [X] fibromatosis is a rare , locally aggressive fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumor that occasionally involves children .

We examined a series of pediatric [X] for CTNNB1 mutations , seen in sporadic tumors , and [Y] germline mutations , associated with familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- FAP -RRB- .

Germline [Y] mutations were present in -LRB- % -RRB- [X] patients .

We present the physical history , clinical presentation , diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a novel germline [Y] mutation , the W421X mutation , which resulted in FAP presenting with about a hundred colorectal polyps , gastric hyperplastic polyps and multiple aggressive intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal [X] tumors .

Because germline [Y] analysis is not routinely performed in children with [X] tumours , the diagnosis FAP may escape detection .

The aim of this study is to form guidelines for the identification of possible [Y] germline mutation carriers among children with [X] tumours , based on CTNNB1 mutation analysis and immunohistochemical analysis -LRB- IHC -RRB- for beta-catenin .

PATIENTS AND METHODS : We performed IHC of beta-catenin and mutation analysis of CTNNB1 and [Y] in paediatric [X] tumours , diagnosed between and in the Erasmus MC , Rotterdam .

Using an MSC cell line derived from an FAP-associated [X] tumor , we confirmed an expected loss in the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and the transcriptional repressor BMI-1 while documenting the coexpression of markers for chondrocytes , adipocytes , and osteocytes .

Together , our findings argue that [X] tumors result from the growth of MSCs in a wound healing setting that is associated with deregulated Wnt signaling due to [Y] loss .

This study investigated the risk of [X] in FAP , the relation between specific [Y] gene mutations and [X] formation , and the clinical characteristics of FAP patients with [X] .

This study investigated the risk of [X] in FAP , the relation between specific [Y] gene mutations and [X] formation , and the clinical characteristics of FAP patients with [X] .

[Y] gene mutations were similar in families with and without [X] .

[X] development was not linked to specific [Y] gene mutations and was not found predominantly in women .

Hereditary [X] disease due to a frameshift mutation at codon of the [Y] [X] tumors are slowly growing fibrous tumors highly resistant to therapy and often fatal .

No ' [Y] mutations were detected in two patients with [X] tumours and a family history of colorectal cancer and polyps .

FAP is caused by mutations in the [Y] gene and various genotype-phenotype relationships have been defined including reports that colorectal polyposis is less severe with mutations ' to codon and that the risk of [X] tumours is high in FAP patients with [Y] gene mutations between codons and .

There is relatively little information on the phenotype of [Y] gene mutations ' to codon ; however , one large family has been reported with a mutation at codon which presents with a highly variable phenotype which includes [X] disease .

These findings demonstrate -LRB- i -RRB- that FAP and FIF are allelic , and -LRB- ii -RRB- that [Y] gene mutations which truncate the [Y] protein distal to the beta-catenin binding domain are associated with [X] tumours , absent CHRPE and variable but attenuated polyposis expression .

Coexistence of somatic and germ-line mutations of [Y] gene in [X] tumors from [X] tumors , which are locally invasive with recurrence but without metastasis , are frequently observed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis after abdominal surgery or during pregnancy .

CONCLUSIONS : These findings are compatible with the presence of a `` second hit '' inactivation of the [Y] gene and implicate this gene in the pathogenesis of [X] tumors .

INTRODUCTION : Gardner 's syndrome is the association of familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- FAP -RRB- with an anaphase promoting complex -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene mutation and several extradigestive manifestations : osteomas , epidermal cysts and [X] tumours .

Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis with [X] caused by an [Y] We present here a case of attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- AFAP -RRB- with a family history of [X] and thyroid tumors .

In cases with limited numbers of colonic polyps and [X] , AFAP may be caused by a mutation in the ' region of [Y] .

Extracolonic findings associated with FAP that were most likely to prompt [Y] testing in an otherwise asymptomatic year-old child with a negative family history were multiple [X] tumors , congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium -LRB- CHRPE -RRB- , jaw osteomas , and hepatoblastoma .

Hereditary [X] tumours arise in individuals affected by either familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- FAP -RRB- or hereditary [X] disease -LRB- HDD -RRB- carrying germline mutations in [Y] .

As predicted by the [Y] germline mutations among these patients , a high percentage -LRB- % -RRB- of FAP-associated [X] showed loss of the [Y] region at , which was infrequently -LRB- % -RRB- seen among sporadic tumours .

On the molecular level , [X] are characterized by mutations in the beta-catenin gene , CTNNB1 , or the adenomatous polyposis coli gene , [Y] .

[X] are rare , benign fibromatous lesions , which can arise in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- FAP -RRB- , a disorder caused by germline adenomatous polyposis coli -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene mutation .

Sporadic homozygous mutations in [Y] result in the development of Wilms ' tumor -LRB- [X] -RRB- , and heterozygous germline mutations can give rise to a phenotype which includes nephropathy and urogenital abnormalities -LRB- the Denys-Drash syndrome -RRB- .

Deletions of the [Y] gene or point mutations which destroy the DNA binding activity of the protein are associated with the development of the pediatric [X] Wilms tumor and Denys-Drash syndrome .

Characterization of regions of chromosomes and involved in [X] There are at least three loci involved in Wilms ' tumor -LRB- WT -RRB- tumorigenesis : [Y] in , WT2 in , and WT3 , as yet unmapped .

Along this line , we have identified a new cellular gene -LRB- nov , for [X] overexpressed -RRB- whose expression is regulated in vitro by the [Y] proteins and is stimulated in all avian nephroblastomas .

The average [Y] expression level in [X] tissue was significantly higher than that in normal kidney tissue and neuroblastomas .

There is cause for enthusiasm based on recent results with antiangiogenesis therapy in select patients with [Y] and progressive vestibular [X] ; however , awareness of the notable risks and limitations of therapies currently in development is required .

Phase II trial of lapatinib in adult and pediatric patients with This single-institution phase II study was performed to estimate the response rate to lapatinib in neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients with progressive vestibular [X] -LRB- VS -RRB- .

Exon scanning for mutation of the [Y] gene in [X] .

Neurofibromatosis antisense oligodeoxynucleotides induce reversible inhibition Mutations in the neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene are the predominant cause in the development of sporadic [X] and are also involved in the pathogenesis of meningiomas and ependymomas .

In patients with vestibular [X] -LRB- VSs -RRB- or identified [Y] mutations , the mild phenotype was defined as < other intracranial tumors and < or = spinal tumors , and the severe phenotype as either > or = other intracranial tumors of > spinal tumors .

Although no mutation was observed in a small set of meningiomas and [X] , alteration of these new genes should now be searched in other tumors with frequent allelic losses on chromosome not associated with [Y] mutation .

[X] and meningiomas occur as multiple tumors in sufferers of neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and as solitary tumors in the general population due to the inactivation of a gene at chromosome .

Individuals affected with [Y] develop [X] at an increased frequency .

The gene for [Y] , a syndrome typically associated with vestibular [X] and meningiomas , is homologous with a family of genes whose members appear to play an important role in bridging the cell membrane with the intracellular cytoskeleton , including moesin , ezrin , radixin , and protein .

Recent mutation analyses have revealed that the [Y] tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated not only in vestibular [X] and meningiomas from [Y] patients , but also in their sporadic counterparts , which represent approximately one-third of all human brain tumors .

Germ-line mutations in the neurofibromatosis gene : correlations with disease Neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- features bilateral vestibular [X] , other benign neural tumors , and cataracts .

Although most [X] are sporadic , they are seen in approximately % of individuals with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an incidence of live births .

It is believed to act as a tumor suppressor gene based on the high frequency of loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- on this autosome in both sporadic and [Y] associated [X] and meningiomas and the identification of inactivating mutation in [Y] patients .

In this study we examined [X] including sporadic [X] -LRB- of which are vestibular [X] -RRB- and [X] obtained from [Y] patients , for mutations in of the coding exons of the [Y] gene .

These results support the hypothesis that loss of function of [Y] is a frequent and fundamental event in the genesis of [X] .

Deletion studies in sporadic and [Y] associated [X] and meningiomas , and the presence of inactivating mutations in [Y] in patients suggest that it acts as a tumor suppressor gene .

Neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by bilateral vestibular [X] and other nonmalignant tumors of the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves .

Mutations in the neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- tumor suppressor gene on chromosome cause a clinically variable autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by bilateral vestibular [X] -LRB- VSs -RRB- , other nervous system tumors , and early onset lenticular cataracts .

In addition , the authors and others have reported that somatic [Y] gene mutations occur frequently in nonfamilial vestibular [X] .

Frequency and distribution of [Y] mutations in [X] .

Sporadic and inherited [X] were scanned for the nature , frequency , and distribution of mutations in the [Y] locus encoding the [Y] tumor suppressor protein on .

The data support the `` two-hit '' tumor suppressor model for formation of [X] and indicate that loss of [Y] function can be achieved by truncation at various locations in the protein .

Advances can be attributed to several fields , but the most important contributions have arisen from the identification of the genes responsible for the dominant inheritance of neurofibromatosis types -LRB- NF1 -RRB- and -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and the development of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement for the early anatomic confirmation of the pathognomonic , bilateral vestibular [X] in [Y] .

The authors suggest that advising young [Y] patients to wait until complications develop , especially hearing loss , before diagnosing and operating for bilateral eighth nerve [X] may not always be in the best interest of the patient .

A further vestibular [X] were investigated for [Y] mutations only .

Somatic [Y] gene mutations were detected in non-familial vestibular [X] and in one of the [Y] vestibular [X] .

These results suggest that somatic mutations of the [Y] tumour suppressor gene are a critical step in the pathogenesis of both familial and non-familial vestibular [X] and that the mechanism of tumourigenesis complies with a ` two-hit ' mutation model .

Neurofibromas in NF1 and [X] in [Y] or schwannomatosis are defined by distinctive molecular hits .

This mechanism could explain the clinical observation that [Y] patients suffer from higher incidences of slowly recovering facial nerve paralysis after vestibular [X] surgery .

Although biallelic mutations of SMARCB1 or LZTR1 have been detected in the tumours of patients with schwannomatosis , the classical two-hit model of tumorigenesis is insufficient to account for [X] growth , since [Y] is also frequently inactivated in these tumours .

In % to % of patients with [X] , a germline mutation of the transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein -LRB- BMP -RRB- pathway genes SMAD4 or [Y] is found .

Dysplasia was equally common in [X] polyps with either a SMAD4 or [Y] germline mutation , in which the involvement of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence does not seem to play a distinct role .

Pathogenesis of plexiform [X] : tumor-stromal/hematopoietic interactions Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a genetic disease that results from either heritable or spontaneous autosomal dominant mutations in the [Y] gene .

A second-hit mutation precedes the predominant [Y] neoplasms , which include myeloid leukemia , optic glioma , and plexiform [X] .

These observations parallel findings in other [Y] disease manifestations and are clearly relevant to medical management of these [X] .

CONCLUSION : [Y] related-oral manifestations are evidenced also during childhood , even if some of the best known , like the [X] , are not yet developed .

A novel [Y] mutation in a Chinese patient with giant cafe-au-lait macule in Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] ; OMIM # -RRB- is a common neurocutaneous disorder that is characterized by multiple cafe-au-lait , skinfold freckling , Lisch nodules , and [X] .

Benign tumors of [Y] -LRB- [X] and optic pathway glioma -RRB- and NF2 -LRB- schwannoma , ependymoma , and meningioma -RRB- and schwannomatosis -LRB- schwannoma -RRB- can cause significant morbidity , and there are no proven drug treatments for any form of NF .

Social-emotional functioning of children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis OBJECTIVE : This descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to determine how cognitive , disease , and environmental variables relate to social-emotional functioning in youth with [Y] and plexiform [X] .

Downregulation of the [Y] gene by RNA interference -LRB- RNAi -RRB- induced an increase in Bcl-xL expression and a decrease in its sensitivity to apoptosis in the benign [X] cell line and primary normal cells .

Our case report is about the surgical management of a giant [X] of the right gluteal fold in a male with [Y] .

[Y] microdeletion syndrome is more severe than [Y] caused by gene mutations , with individuals exhibiting facial dysmorphisms , developmental delay -LRB- DD -RRB- , intellectual disability -LRB- ID -RRB- , and excessive [X] .

-LSB- Neurofibromatosis : pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies -- a systematic Neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] , von Recklinghausen 's disease -RRB- is a dominantly inherited multi-organ disease defined primarily by cafe au lait patches and [X] .

Patients with sporadic MPNST were included only if the MPNST was not associated with [Y] or a [X] or if it was immunohistochemically S100-positive .

-LSB- Plexiform [X] of the bladder associated with neurofibromatosis type : Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disease with multiple [X] and cafe-au-lait spots .

We report a case of plexiform [X] of the bladder associated with [Y] .

Although numerous germline [Y] mutations have been identified , relatively few somatic [Y] mutations have been described in [X] .

Here we have screened cutaneous [X] , excised from unrelated [Y] patients , for somatic [Y] mutations .

LOH spanning the [Y] gene region was evident in [X] , but in contrast to previous data from MPNSTs , it was absent at the TP53 , CDKN2A and RB1 gene loci .

[Y] manifests as a heritable susceptibility to tumours of neural tissue mainly located in the skin -LRB- [X] -RRB- and pigmented skin lesions .

-LSB- -RSB- - Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in children with The objective of this study was to investigate the predictive value of -LSB- -RSB- - fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography -LRB- FDG-PET -RRB- in detecting malignant transformation of plexiform [X] in children with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

An electronic search of the medical records was performed to determine patients with [Y] who had undergone FDG-PET for plexiform [X] between and .

Identification of the genes that are mutated in genetic diseases characterized by the development of either [X] and MPNSTs -LSB- neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- -RSB- or schwannomas -LSB- neurofibromatosis type -LRB- NF2 -RRB- , schwannomatosis and Carney complex type -RSB- has greatly advanced our understanding of these mechanisms .

emission tomography -LRB- FDG-PET -RRB- evaluation of BACKGROUND : Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- are at risk for developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors -LRB- MPNST -RRB- , which frequently arise in preexisting plexiform [X] -LRB- PN -RRB- .

Imaging confirmed cerebral vacuolisation changes seen in [Y] and a left facial plexiform [X] involving the parotid gland .

Bone mineral metabolism in patients with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- von The neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is characterized by specific cutaneous features -LRB- [X] , `` cafe-au-lait '' spots of the skin -RRB- and alterations of several tissue -LRB- nervous , vascular -RRB- and bone deformities , such as scoliosis , congenital pseudoarthrosis and bone dysplasia of tibia .

Clinical characteristics predicting internal [X] in children with OBJECTIVE : To identify clinical characteristics associated with internal [X] in children with [Y] , as a means of ensuring the early identification of patients at high risk for malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors developed from preexisting internal [X] .

CONCLUSIONS : Several easily recognizable clinical characteristics indicate a high risk of internal [X] in children with [Y] and , therefore , a need for very close monitoring .

Interactive segmentation of plexiform [X] tissue : method and preliminary Plexiform [X] -LRB- PNs -RRB- are a major manifestation of neurofibromatosis-1 -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , a common genetic disease involving the nervous system .

Interactive segmentation of plexiform [X] tissue : method and preliminary Plexiform [X] -LRB- PNs -RRB- are a major manifestation of neurofibromatosis-1 -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , a common genetic disease involving the nervous system .

BACKGROUND CONTEXT : One hallmark of neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is the presence of multiple [X] , which are hormonally responsive and may undergo rapid growth during periods of hormonal surge .

Although spinal [X] occur in up to % of patients with [Y] , they rarely cause neurologic sequelae , especially in the young .

Comprehensive [Y] , NF2 and SMARCB1 mutation analyses revealed no mutation in blood lymphocytes and in schwann cells cultured from plexiform [X] .

Consistent with Knudson 's two-hit hypothesis , [Y] patients harbouring a heterozygous germline [Y] mutation develop [X] upon somatic mutation of the second , wild-type , [Y] allele .

While the identification of somatic mutations in [Y] patients has always been problematic on account of the extensive cellular heterogeneity manifested by [X] , the classification of [Y] somatic mutations is a prerequisite for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying [Y] tumorigenesis .

Here , the known somatic mutational spectrum for the [Y] gene in a range of NF1-associated neoplasms - including peripheral nerve sheath tumours -LRB- [X] -RRB- , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours , gastrointestinal stromal tumours , gastric carcinoid , juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia , glomus tumours , astrocytomas and phaeochromocytomas - have been collated and analysed .

PTEN and [Y] inactivation in Schwann cells produces a severe phenotype in the The genetic evolution from a benign [X] to a malignant sarcoma in patients with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- syndrome remains unclear .

Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells are believed to be the primary pathogenic cell in [X] because they harbor biallelic neurofibromin -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene mutations .

Plexiform [X] were also less prevalent in patients with mosaic type-2 [Y] microdeletions as compared with patients carrying constitutional -LRB- germline -RRB- type-1 [Y] microdeletions .

By contrast , a previous study indicated a high burden of cutaneous [X] -LRB- N > -RRB- in % of adult patients with germline type-1 [Y] deletions .

The tumor suppressor disorder neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is associated with development of multiple [X] which may grow intraneurally as plexiform [X] -LRB- PNF -RRB- or intracutaneously -LRB- CNF -RRB- .

Role of noncoding RNA ANRIL in genesis of plexiform [X] in BACKGROUND : Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a tumor predisposition syndrome with a worldwide birth incidence of one in .

Genetic factors unrelated to the [Y] locus are thought to influence the number of plexiform [X] -LRB- PNFs -RRB- in patients with [Y] , but no factors have been identified to date .

CONCLUSION : Identification of ANRIL as a modifier gene in [Y] may offer clues to the molecular pathogenesis of PNFs , particularly [X] formation , and emphasizes the unanticipated role of large noncoding RNA in activation of critical regulators of tumor development .

Risk factors for higher tumor volume included female gender -LRB- P = -RRB- and increasing subcutaneous [X] -LRB- P = -RRB- in [Y] patients , absence of cutaneous schwannomas in NF2 patients -LRB- P = -RRB- , and increasing age in schwannomatosis patients -LRB- p = -RRB- .

Hematopoietic-stromal interactions underpin the plexiform [X] , a debilitating tumor arising in individuals afflicted with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , a common genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the [Y] tumor suppressor gene .

Skin-derived precursor cells as an in vitro modelling tool for the study of type The most characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is the development of [X] .

Moreover , a nullizygous population of cells that is S100beta negative is present in human [X] , and [Y] -LRB- + / - -RRB- multipotent progenitor cells are seemingly recruited to the tumor .

This evidence supports the [X] stem cell hypothesis and a putative involvement of SKPs in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease , suggesting that SKPs could become a valuable tool for the in vitro study of [Y] .

Phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with BACKGROUND : Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth of plexiform [X] -LRB- PN -RRB- in children with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of cutaneous [X] , multiple cafd-au-lait spots and pigmented nodules of the iris known as Lisch nodules .

Biallelic inactivation of [Y] in a sporadic plexiform [X] .

Plexiform [X] are a major cause of morbidity in individuals with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

A role for the [Y] gene in solitary plexiform [X] has never been described .

In this study , we report a boy who was diagnosed with a plexiform [X] , without other [Y] diagnostic criteria .

We conclude that biallelic [Y] inactivation was at the origin of the isolated plexiform [X] in this patient .

Treatment of diffuse [X] -LRB- not associated with [Y] -RRB- is often surgical resection .

In this report , we presented an adult patient , without [Y] diagnosed , who developed invalidate status of left upper limb due to a giant diffuse [X] involving the left brachial plexus , with a high growth diffuse pattern and plexiform architecture imagistic , grossly and without results at both surgical interventions .

Plexiform [X] of the eye region occurring in patients without PURPOSE : The purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between Plexiform [X] -LRB- PN -RRB- of the eye region and Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Patients affected by [Y] typically present with cutaneous [X] , cafe au lait spots and eye involvement , but they can also be affected by various visceral tumors , such as [X] -LRB- nodular or plexiform type -RRB- , gastrointestinal stromal tumors or endocrine tumors , such as pheochromocytomas .

The [X] is the hallmark lesion of [Y] that develops from peripheral nerves .

Genetic alterations in a malignant schwannoma from a patient with In a patient with neurofibromatosis -LRB- von Recklinghausen disease ; [Y] -RRB- , normal lymphocytes , five cutaneous [X] , and tumour tissue from a recurrence of a malignant schwannoma were analysed for genetic alterations .

Our data indicate that the [Y] gene may function as a tumour suppressor gene , and that , either by effect of dose reduction or complete inactivation , both the [Y] gene and the TP53 gene may be critical for the progression of a [X] to a malignant schwannoma .

Immunoblotting also revealed positive expression of the [Y] gene product in the brain , the normal peripheral nerves , and of ENU-induced [X] .

Neuroblastoma growth factors derived from [X] -LRB- [Y] -RRB- : participation of Human glioma cell extracts were found to elicit a marked growth-promoting activity on human neuroblastoma cells .

This activity was also detected in the extracts of [X] type -LRB- [Y] ; von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis -RRB- comprising aberrant Schwann cell growth .

Identification of [Y] mutations in both alleles of a dermal [X] .

A hallmark clinical feature of neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is multiple dermal [X] , benign tumours that typically appear in early adolescence and increase in numbers throughout life .

Even though accumulating evidence demonstrates that [Y] acts as a tumour suppressor in some cells , mutations have not been identified in both [Y] alleles in dermal [X] .

In contrast to these reports , Colman et al. demonstrated [Y] LOH of dermal [X] derived from of [Y] patients , yet the constitutional [Y] mutations in these patients were not identified , and the extent of the somatic deletions beyond the [Y] locus were not established .

In this study , we show that a dermal [X] from an [Y] individual who has a constitutional deletion of the entire [Y] locus harbours a deletion of [Y] exon in the other allele .

This is the first definitive identification of a somatic mutation which is limited to the [Y] locus in a benign [X] from an [Y] individual in whom the constitutional [Y] mutation is known .

All five patients with deletions were remarkable for exhibiting a large number of [X] for their age , suggesting that deletion of an unknown gene in the [Y] region may affect tumor initiation or development .

Findings previously unreported in [Y] included an aqueductal web resulting in hydrocephalus , intraocular [X] resulting in retinal detachment , and asymptomatic enlargement of the septum pellucidum .

Regulation of neurofibromin expression in rat sciatic nerve and cultured Schwann Loss of function mutations at the [Y] locus may act intrinsically in Schwann cells to cause the formation of benign Schwann cell tumors -LRB- [X] -RRB- in patients with type neurofibromatosis .

Novel alleles , hemizygosity and deletions at an Alu-repeat within the Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- -LRB- von Recklinghausen -RRB- is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterised by the presence of peripheral [X] , cafe-au-lait spots and Lisch nodules of the iris .

Ras-GTP levels were increased in [Y] neurogenic sarcomas -LRB- times -RRB- and benign [Y] [X] -LRB- four times -RRB- , compared to non [Y] schwannomas .

The majority of tumors occurring in patients with [Y] are benign [X] , sarcomatous transformation is uncommon and most often occurs within the larger plexiform [X] .

The molecular basis of [X] development in [Y] is loss of expression of the [Y] gene and its gene product , neurofibromin , resulting in elevated levels of Ras-guanosine triphosphate .

[Y] is characterized by the appearance of cafe-au-lait spots and [X] in addition to iris hamartomas , or Lisch nodules , of the eye , during the first and second decades .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , also called von Recklinghausen disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis , is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterised by multiple [X] , cafe au lait spots , and Lisch nodules of the iris , with a variable clinical expression .

The most common symptomatic manifestation of [Y] is the plexiform [X] .

Repression of the [Y] gene by Tax may expain the development of [X] in In familial neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , individuals with a germ line-transmitted [Y] mutation develop multiple [X] .

To explain the observation that transgenic mice expressing the human T-lymphotropic virus type -LRB- HTLV-1 -RRB- tax gene under the control of the viral regulatory element also develop multiple [X] , we demonstrate that the Tax trans-regulator can functionally repress [Y] gene expression through a cis-acting element located immediately upstream of its transcriptional start site , thereby allowing the development of benign [X] without the need for direct mutations in [Y] .

A typical alteration observed in [Y] is the eyelid plexiform [X] , often associated with facial homolateral hypertrophy .

A Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a common , autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a variety of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations -LRB- such as cafe au lait spots -RRB- , Lisch nodules , plexiform [X] , skeletal abnormalities , an increased risk for malignancy , and the development of learning disabilities .

To test for loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- at the neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene locus , three intragenic polymorphic markers were analyzed after polymerase chain reaction amplification , starting from single SC isolated from primary cultures of [X] , of five informative [Y] patients .

The detection of contiguous gene deletions at the neurofibromatosis locus with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a common genetic disorder characterized primarily by the development of multiple [X] and pigmentary changes .

FISH studies performed with P1-9 , P1-12 , and a set of overlapping cosmid clones mapping telomeric to the [Y] locus identified large deletions in two new neurofibromatosis type patients who , like previously characterized deletion patients , had mildly dysmorphic facial features and large numbers of cutaneous [X] .

Scanning the first part of the neurofibromatosis type gene by RNA-SSCP : Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- of von Recklinghausen is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterized by peripheral [X] , cafe-au-lait spots and Lisch nodules of the iris .

Characteristics which the two main forms [Y] and NF2 have in common are a positive family history , characteristic skin alterations , such as cafe au lait macules , axillary or inguinal freckling and neural tumors such as [X] and optic glioma -LRB- [Y] -RRB- as well as -LRB- bilateral -RRB- vestibular schwannomas -LRB- NF2 -RRB- .

A novel mutation in [Y] is associated with diverse intra-familial phenotypic Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a dysregulated neurocutaneous disorder , characterized by [X] and cafe-au-lait spots .

Dermal [X] are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type one -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , and their developmental origin still unsolved .

Although [Y] loss is required for [X] initiation , some features of these benign tumors resemble a skin injury state and cutaneous trauma or other insults might support tumor development .

Since adult terminal Schwann cells ensheathing nerve endings are able to dedifferentiate into a progenitor-like state in response to nerve crushing , we hypothesized that dedifferentiation of [Y] - / - Schwann cells could be at the origin of human dermal [X] .

We posit that onset of nerve regeneration might have a role in dermal [X] initiation via dedifferentiation of [Y] - / - Schwann cells .

Using a qualitative approach to conceptualize concerns of patients with Neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- plexiform [X] -LRB- pNFs -RRB- are associated with a variety of symptoms and concerns that affect patients ' quality of life -LRB- QOL -RRB- , highlighting the value of incorporating the patients ' perspective when evaluating treatment outcomes .

Patient was a woman with [Y] and a progressive low grade MPNST developing from a diffuse/plexiform orbital [X] that arose in childhood .

Because we now know that the presence of cafe-au-lait macules and freckling might not distinguish between [Y] and other conditions such as Legius syndrome , definitive [Y] was defined as the presence of cafe-au-lait macules with or without freckling plus one of the following : Lisch nodules , [X] , plexiform [X] , bone dysplasia , optic pathway glioma , or familial history of [Y] .

Sleep and pulmonary outcomes for clinical trials of airway plexiform OBJECTIVE : Plexiform [X] -LRB- PNs -RRB- are complex , benign nerve sheath tumors that occur in approximately % % of individuals with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Children with [Y] are particularly at risk for the development of tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system , such as [X] , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors , and low-grade astrocytomas of the optic pathway and other brain regions .

[Y] is generally complicated with one or more neurobehavioral disorders or tumors located in the peripheral nervous system such as [X] , peripheral nerve sheath tumor , pheochromocytoma , etc. .

Orofacial manifestations in [Y] have been documented before but occurrence of multifocal intraosseous -LRB- IO -RRB- and extraosseous -LRB- EO -RRB- [X] is rare .

The present case highlights the importance of imaging findings in the diagnosis and management of multifocal jaw , infratemporal , and parotid [X] with muscular hypoplasia in an eight-year-old girl with [Y] .

Deregulation of RAS signaling in Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- results in the development of multiple [X] , complex tumor of the peripheral nerves with no effective medical treatment .

There is increasing evidences that [X] initiates through loss of [Y] function in the Schwann cell lineage , followed by a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the surrounding tumor microenvironment .

In [Y] patients , [X] always develop along peripheral nerves and do not migrate to distant organs , including the central nervous system .

His past and family histories were unremarkable ; however , small [X] and cafe au lait spots all over his body led to the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a progressive genetic disorder characterized by physical findings such as cafe-au-lait macules , Lisch nodules , and [X] in addition to other medical complications .

Neurofibromatosis type associated low grade gliomas : A comparison with sporadic Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disorder , associated with a variable clinical phenotype including cafe-au-lait spots , intertriginous freckling , Lisch nodules , [X] , optic pathway gliomas and distinctive bony lesions .

Immortalization of human normal and [Y] [X] Schwann cells .

A combined one-stage surgical approach of orbital tumor debulking , lid BACKGROUND AND AIM : To describe a series of children with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and a plexiform [X] of the orbit with ptosis who underwent a combined one-stage surgery for tumor debulking , lid reconstruction , and ptosis repair .

In [Y] , involvement of vagus nerve can occur in the form of [X] .

A few cases of [X] of thoracic vagus nerve have been reported while [X] of cervical vagus nerve with [Y] is quite rare .

He was diagnosed as having [Y] with [X] of right cervical vagus nerve .

The present study reports the clinical and biomolecular features of EN in a [Y] patient with the clear clinical diagnostic criteria of multiple cafe-au-lait macules , [X] , EN , a positive family history and a novel [Y] germline c. mutation .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an inherited disease in which affected patients are predisposed to develop benign Schwann cell -LRB- SC -RRB- tumours called [X] .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a multisystem genetic disease which is characterized by cutaneous findings , most importantly cafe-au-lait spots and axillary freckling , by skeletal dysplasia , and by the growth of both benign and malignant nervous system neoplasms , most notably benign [X] .

[Y] frameshift mutation -LRB- c. -RRB- association with nervous system Neurofibromatosis type , also known as [Y] or von Recklinghausen 's disease , is a common neurocutaneous syndrome that presents with multiple cafe-au-lait patches , skinfold freckling , dermatofibromas , [X] , and Lisch nodules .

Plexiform [X] are benign tumors originating from peripheral nerve sheaths , generally associated with Neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

INTRODUCTION : Intraparotid [X] of the facial nerve are extremely rare and mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Chronic pain is commonly reported among individuals with [Y] and plexiform [X] tumors -LRB- PNs -RRB- .

Cutaneous [X] are the hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

The results led us to speculate that the development of cutaneous [X] includes the recruitment of multipotent [Y] -LRB- + / - -RRB- precursor cells .

This patient had been previously diagnosed with [Y] on the basis of multiple CAL macules and suspected subcutaneous [X] .

Preclincial testing of sorafenib and RAD001 in the Nf -LRB- flox/flox -RRB- ; DhhCre mouse BACKGROUND : Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an inherited disease predisposing affected patients to variable numbers of benign [X] .

The most common and important problems in [Y] are cognitive impairment , optic pathway gliomas , plexiform [X] , and orthopaedic issues .

Among [Y] patients , MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform [X] and in those with large number of cutaneous -LRB- > -RRB- or subcutaneous -LRB- > -RRB- [X] than in patients without such tumours .

Different patterns of mast cells distinguish diffuse from encapsulated Multiple [X] are cardinal features of neurofibromatosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Mast cells are present in most [X] and have been shown to be critical to the origin and progression of [X] in both human [Y] and relevant mouse models .

A total of Finnish patients with [Y] , including four patients with plexiform [X] of the cranial nerve , and their age - and gender-matched controls , were enrolled in the study .

These neoplasms , which are termed dermal and plexiform [X] respectively , have distinct clinical courses ; of particular note , plexiform , but not dermal , [X] often undergo malignant progression to form malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors -LRB- MPNSTs -RRB- , the most common malignancy occurring in [Y] patients .

These models have been designed to address key questions including : -LRB- -RRB- whether [Y] loss in the Schwann cell lineage is essential for tumorigenesis ; -LRB- -RRB- what cell type -LRB- s -RRB- in the Schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal [X] , plexiform [X] and MPNSTs ; -LRB- -RRB- how the tumor microenvironment contributes to neoplasia ; -LRB- -RRB- what additional mutations contribute to neurofibroma-MPNST progression ; -LRB- -RRB- what role different neurofibromin-regulated Ras proteins play in this process and -LRB- -RRB- how dysregulated growth factor signaling facilitates PNS tumorigenesis .

We report the first case of a plexiform [X] from a [Y] patient containing exclusively lipoblast-like cells exhibiting morphological and immunohistochemical features identical to univaculoted lipoblasts typically seen in myxoid liposarcoma .

Little is known about the origin and nature of atypical [X] in [Y] patients .

In this study , we classified the atypical [X] in the spectrum of NF1-associated PNSTs by analyzing tumor samples from [Y] patients .

Exceptions are cases reporting the in-frame microdeletion c. , presenting with the typical pigmentary features of [Y] , but no cutaneous or plexiform [X] .

We confirm the association of the c. mutation in [Y] with a particular clinical phenotype , especially with lack of detectable [X] .

In the absence of [X] , starting [Y] testing with the screening of exon may be worthwhile .

We report the detailed clinical presentation and molecular features of a spinal neurofibromatosis familial case where a woman , presenting with multiple bilateral spinal [X] and no other clinical feature of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , inherited a paternal large multiexonic deletion -LRB- c. - ?

RESULTS : Radiologic abnormalities in the jaws were found in of patients with [Y] , including patients with plexiform [X] in the head and neck region .

Dissecting loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- in neurofibromatosis type Dermal [X] -LRB- dNFs -RRB- are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system typically associated with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients .

Genes controlling the integrity of the DNA are likely to influence the number of [X] developed because dNFs are caused by somatic mutational inactivation of the [Y] gene , frequently evidenced by loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- .

The bi-allelic inactivation of the [Y] gene through a `` second hit '' seems to be of crucial importance to the development of certain manifestations , such as [X] , cafe-au-lait macules , and glomus tumors .

A recent study identified a multipotent precursor cell population with an [Y] -LRB- + / - -RRB- genotype that resides in human cutaneous [X] and that has been suggested to play a role in their pathogenesis .

Nf1 - / Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a common genetic disorder and is characterized by both malignant and nonmalignant [X] , which are composed of Schwann cells , degranulating mast cells , fibroblasts , and extracellular matrix .

The authors review their experience with the management of a giant -LRB- lb -RRB- [X] of the lower extremity in a male with [Y] .

Nullizygous -LRB- [Y] -LRB- - / - -RRB- -RRB- SKPs do give rise to [X] when transplanted to heterozygous mice .

Plexiform [X] of the eye region occurring in patients without PURPOSE : The purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between Plexiform [X] -LRB- PN -RRB- of the eye region and Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Clinico-pathological and biomolecular findings in Italian patients with multiple BACKGROUND : [X] occurs as isolated or multiple lesions frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , a common autosomal dominant disorder affecting in individuals .

The cases with [Y] rearrangement were divided into [X] , three DLBCL/BL , and six DLBCL .

The cases with [Y] rearrangement were divided into [X] , three DLBCL/BL , and six DLBCL .

Ongoing mutations in the N-terminal domain of [Y] affect transactivation in A panel of Burkitt 's lymphoma -LRB- [X] -RRB- and nine other cell lines was examined for mutations in the N-terminal transactivation domain of [Y] .

Ongoing mutations in the N-terminal domain of [Y] affect transactivation in A panel of Burkitt 's lymphoma -LRB- [X] -RRB- and nine other cell lines was examined for mutations in the N-terminal transactivation domain of [Y] .

The effect of mutations on transactivation by [Y] was tested by expression of GAL4/c-Myc fusion proteins in the [X] cell line Raji .

The effect of mutations on transactivation by [Y] was tested by expression of GAL4/c-Myc fusion proteins in the [X] cell line Raji .

Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer -LRB- such as BRCA1 and [Y] -RRB- , as well as a precursor lesion of [X] called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma , which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies .

-LSB- Oncopathological aspects of BRCA1 and [Y] genes inactivation in tumors of Ovarian carcinoma represents a heterogeneous group of malignant epithelial tumors which could be divided into two fundamental groups : Type I -LRB- endometrioid carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma , low grade serous carcinoma , mucinous carcinoma and more rare seromucinous carcinoma and malignant Brenner tumor -RRB- and type II -LRB- high grade serous carcinoma - [X] -RRB- .

Detection of exostosin glycosyltransferase gene mutations in patients with Exostosin glycosyltransferase -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and EXT2 have been identified as causative genes in [X] ; however , it is not known whether these genes are also involved in condylar [X] .

Breakpoint characterization of large deletions in [Y] or EXT2 in multiple BACKGROUND : [X] -LRB- cartilage-capped bone tumors -RRB- are by far the most commonly treated of all primary benign bone tumors -LRB- % -RRB- .

[X] are caused by genetic abnormalities in [Y] or EXT2 : homozygous deletion of [Y] characterizes sporadic [X] -LRB- non-familial/solitary -RRB- , and germline mutations in [Y] or EXT2 combined with loss of heterozygosity define hereditary multiple [X] .

Our data therefore point to a model of oncogenesis in which the [X] creates a niche in which wild-type cells with functional [Y] are predisposed to acquire other mutations giving rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma , indicating that EXT-independent mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma .

Tamibarotene -LRB- Am80 -RRB- , a synthetic retinoid approved in Japan for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- , is a retinoic acid receptor -LRB- [Y] -RRB- agonist with high specificity for RARalpha and RARbeta over RARgamma .

Case of pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia presenting as extramedullary tumor BACKGROUND : Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a malignant subtype of acute myeloid leukemia caused by the PML-retinoic acid receptor -LRB- [Y] -RRB- alpha fusion gene .

The most frequent is the t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q22 ; q21 -RRB- , which fuses the PML and [Y] genes , giving rise to acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

The observation that particular regions of the PML and [Y] loci are susceptible to topoII-mediated DNA damage induced by epirubicin and mitoxantrone may underlie the propensity of these agents to cause [X] .

Characterization of cryptic rearrangements , deletion , complex variants of PML , Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is characterized by a reciprocal translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q22 ; q21 -RRB- leading to the disruption of Promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- PML -RRB- and Retionic Acid Receptor Alpha -LRB- [Y] -RRB- followed by reciprocal PML-RARA fusion in % of the cases .

In the present study , besides diagnostic approach we sought to analyze these cases for identification and characterization of cryptic rearrangements , deletion variants and unknown [Y] translocation variants by application of D-FISH and [Y] break-apart probe strategy on interphase and metaphase cells in a large series of cases of [X] .

The cell biology of disease : Acute promyelocytic leukemia , arsenic , and PML Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is driven by a chromosomal translocation whose product , the PML/retinoic acid -LRB- RA -RRB- receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] -RRB- fusion protein , affects both nuclear receptor signaling and PML body assembly .

In the [X] cell line NB4 , the PML gene is fused with the [Y] alpha gene due to a chromosomal rearrangement .

Interferon augments PML and PML/RAR alpha expression in normal myeloid and acute The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- in the acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- ; translocation .

Localization of the chromosome breakpoints and expression of multiple PML-RAR Translocation -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q22 ; q12-q21 -RRB- is a chromosome aberration specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- , that generates a chimeric gene between the promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- PML -RRB- gene on chromosome and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene , on chromosome .

In addition , a new variant , t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q32 ; q12 -RRB- , with a [Y] rearrangement was described in a child with atypical [X] .

Whereas [Y] rearrangement appears sufficient for an APL-like phenotype , it seems that the presence of a classical PML/RARA is required for typical [X] with response to ATRA .

In many [X] patients , translocation between [Y] alpha gene and an oncogenic gene , PML , can be detected , although the roles of their fusion products -LRB- [Y] alpha-PML and PML-RAR alpha -RRB- in [X] induction have not been understood .

The t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation , specifically associated with the human acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- , fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- to a novel gene PML generating the hybrid protein PML-RAR .

In [X] , one of the [Y] genes , [Y] , is fused to PML in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- .

In [X] , one of the [Y] genes , [Y] , is fused to PML in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- .

The PML-RAR alpha gene product of the t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation inhibits retinoic Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is characterized by an arrest of granulocytic differentiation and a reciprocal t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation fusing the PML gene to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- gene .

Retinoic acid regulates aberrant nuclear localization of PML-RAR alpha in acute Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is characterized by a specific t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation that fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- to a novel gene product , PML .

PML , a Ring-finger protein , participates in the disruption of normal myeloid differentiation when fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- by the translocation between chromosomes -LRB- Chrs -RRB- and in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

All-trans retinoic acid -LRB- RA -RRB- induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- presumably by binding directly to [Y] alpha of [X] cells .

To determine if alterations of the ligand binding domain of [Y] alpha might be involved in several malignant hematologic disorders , the mutational status of this region -LRB- exons , , and -RRB- was examined in samples that included a variety of cell lines and fresh cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes -LRB- MDS -RRB- and acute myeloid leukemias -LRB- AML -RRB- , including [X] patients , of whom were resistant to RA and who was refractory to RA at diagnosis , using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism -LRB- PCR-SSCP -RRB- analysis and DNA sequencing .

Detection of PML/retinoic acid receptor a gene rearrangements by polymerase chain Breakpoints of the ; translocation in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- have been identified within PML and retinoic acid receptor a -LRB- [Y] -RRB- genes in chromosomes and , respectively .

In this study , PCR analysis using genomic DNA of [X] cells is proved to be useful for identifying the breakpoints of the PML and the [Y] genes .

A rational biologic basis for safe sexual conduct in preventing the spread of Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for PML-RAR alpha fusion Chromosome translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- results in cleavage in the introns of PML gene on chromosome and in the intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- gene on chromosome , creation and expression of PML-RAR alpha and [Y] alpha-PML fusion genes .

-LRB- -RRB- [X] is not a homogeneous disease in that among patients studied at the molecular level , although a PML-RARA fusion gene was detected in cases , one had a variant translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- bearing fusion gene PLZF-RARA , one presented no obvious structural alteration of the PML gene while the [Y] gene was rearranged , and three patients had no rearrangement of either PML or [Y] genes .

[X] is characterized by three distinct and unique features : i -RRB- accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features ; ii -RRB- invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- locus ; iii -RRB- exquisite sensitivity of [X] blasts to the differentiating action of retinoic acid -LRB- RA -RRB- .

Functional analysis of the various fusion proteins as well as [Y] alpha partners is revealing strikingly common features beneath a misleading structural heterogeneity which unravels a possible unifying molecular mechanism towards [X] leukemogenesis .

A non-classical translocation involving -LRB- retinoic acid receptor alpha -RRB- in Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- almost always involves a chromosomal translocation t -LRB- -RRB- that results in the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- gene with a transcription factor gene called PML .

Several cases of [X] with t -LRB- ; -RRB- have recently been described , involving fusion of the [Y] alpha gene with a new zinc finger gene named PLZF .

We report here a second non-classical translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- , with a rearranged [Y] alpha gene in a child with [X] .

The identification of a second variant translocation involving the [Y] alpha gene in [X] suggests yet another [Y] alpha rearrangement related to neoplastic myelopoiesis .

Which progenitor is the target cell in the development of acute promyelocytic Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is characterized by the t -LRB- ; -RRB- which involves the PML gene and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- gene , and the subsequent PML/RAR alpha fusion gene is a key event in the leukemogenesis of [X] .

Moreover , in the t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- , PML fusion to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- is the likely molecular basis of leukaemogenesis .

-LSB- Molecular study of the mechanism of chromosomal translocation -LRB- ; -RRB- in acute Molecular studies of chromosomal translocation -LRB- ; -RRB- in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- have shown that retinoic acid receptor A -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene on chromosome is juxtaposed to the PML gene on chromosome .

Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is thought to be caused by the t -LRB- -RRB- translocation that fuses the PML gene to that of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- and generates a PML/RAR alpha fusion protein .

Recently , clinical use of retinoic acid in acute pro-myelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- was proposed to induce complete remission in the leukemic cells , which have the t -LRB- -RRB- of chromosomal anomaly producing a different protein from the normal [Y] .

[X] is characterized cytogenetically by a t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation which involves both the PML gene on chromosome and the [Y] alpha gene on chromosome and gives rise to the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein .

PLZF-RAR alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- Recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- which juxtaposes PLZF , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to [Y] , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- .

PLZF-RAR alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- Recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- which juxtaposes PLZF , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to [Y] , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- .

In transient-expression assays , both the PLZF -LRB- A -RRB- - [Y] alpha and PLZF -LRB- B -RRB- - [Y] alpha fusion proteins like the PML-RAR alpha protein resulting from the well-known t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation in [X] , antagonized endogenous and transfected wild-type [Y] alpha in the presence of retinoic acid .

Interferons induce normal and aberrant retinoic-acid receptors type alpha in Treatment of the acute promyelocytic -LRB- [X] -RRB- cell line NB4 with interferon alpha -LRB- IFN -LRB- alpha -RRB- -RRB- , as well as IFN -LRB- beta -RRB- and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic-acid receptor type alpha -LRB- [Y] -LRB- alpha -RRB- -RRB- and the leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor PML-RAR .

PML has been identified through its fusion to the [Y] alpha gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Treatment of [X] cells with RA , RA or analogs of [Y] alpha or RXR alpha also failed to induce apoptosis .

Molecular analysis of the [X] breakpoint has revealed the involvement of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene on chromosome and the promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- PML -RRB- gene on chromosome .

The fusion of [Y] alpha and PML consistent with [X] appears to have occurred at the distal juxtaposition of these sequences in the derivative chromosome .

Fluorescence in situ hybridization -LRB- FISH -RRB- using cosmidic probes specific for [Y] alpha and PML , regions did not show a fusion signal as in [X] .

Molecular diagnosis and monitoring of acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with The characteristic balanced ; translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- , of acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- gene on chromosome to PML , a recently described gene of unknown function , on chromosome .

Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- with break points in the -LRB- [Y] -RRB- gene and the zyl gene also produces a fusion transcript .

These data , along with previous reports of rare variant translocations in [X] , indicate that while dysregulation of [Y] by gene fusion may be essential for the [X] phenotype , the particular fusion partner may determine clinicopathological aspects , including presentation , response to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid -LRB- ATRA -RRB- , and prognosis .

Most patients with [X] express del -LRB- -RRB- - derived [Y] alpha-PML transcripts as well as the putative leukemogenic PML-RAR alpha associated with add -LRB- -RRB- .

Although parallel assessment of PML-RAR alpha and [Y] alpha-PML can enhance minimal residual disease detection in [X] , this study demonstrates that treatment strategies involving determination of PCR status post-consolidation , even using [Y] alpha-PML in addition to the more conventional PML-RAR alpha assay will fail to identify all patients at risk of relapse .

LYSP100-associated nuclear domains -LRB- LANDs -RRB- : description of a new class of The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- gene in t -LRB- ; -RRB- acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- , creating a PML-RAR alpha fusion oncoprotein .

We describe a patient with the microgranular variant form of [X] , with no detectable cytogenetic abnormality of either chromosomes or , who nevertheless had juxtaposition of PML and [Y] genes and expressed a chimeric transcript .

Our results show that [X] patients with cytogenetically normal chromosomes and may , nevertheless , have involvement of both PML and [Y] genes defining a subgroup of [X] , t -LRB- ; -RRB- - negative/PML-RARA-positive which is analogous to Philadelphia chromosome-negative/BCR-ABL-positive CML .

Paradoxically , [X] cells express PML-RAR , an aberrant form of the retinoic acid receptor type alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- derived from the leukemia-specific t -LRB- ; -RRB- chromosomal translocation .

We show here that AM580 , a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a [Y] alpha agonist , is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in NB4 , an APL-derived cell line , and in freshly isolated [X] blasts .

Detection of PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusion transcripts in acute Chromosome translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- , the breakpoints of which are in the PML gene on chromosome and retinoic acid receptor-alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- gene on chromosome , is specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Clinically typical [X] without t -LRB- ; -RRB- and with the PML-RAR alpha fusion transcripts or rearrangements in PML and/or [Y] alpha gene has been reported , suggesting submicroscopic changes at the molecular level without apparent t -LRB- ; -RRB- or observation of normal metaphases .

Fusion between a novel Kruppel-like zinc finger gene and the retinoic acid We have identified a unique case of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- with a t -LRB- ; -RRB- reciprocal chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] alpha -RRB- and a previously uncharacterized zinc finger gene .

Our results demonstrate for the first time the association of a variant chromosomal translocation involving the [Y] alpha gene with [X] , further implicating the [Y] alpha in leukaemogenesis and also suggesting an important role for PLZF as well as retinoic acid and its receptors in myeloid maturation .

Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [X] -RRB- is characterized by a unique hemorrhagic syndrome , disseminated intravascular coagulation , and the association with the specific -LRB- ; chi q22-23 : q12-21 -RRB- translocation , which disrupts the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and the promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- PML -RRB- genes .

Demonstration of the existence , in some APL-like leukemias , of masked translocations with involvement of PML and [Y] , thus allows to -LRB- i -RRB- confirm the diagnosis of [X] , -LRB- ii -RRB- adapt the treatment and -LRB- iii -RRB- monitor the residual disease .
