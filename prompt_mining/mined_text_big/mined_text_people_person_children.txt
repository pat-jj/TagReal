[Y]ianism attributed its gnosis to  [Y], third son of eve and [X], and norea, wife of noah, who also plays a role in mandeanism and manicheanism.

the three steles (or tablets) of [Y] are in essence, three hymns written in adoration for the more abstract being, barbelo, from the perspective of the archetype of [Y] (“emmakha [Y]”) and his father [X] (or “ger[X]as”).

 the steles themselves were allegedly written by emmakha [Y], a spiritual archetype of [Y], the son of [X] and eve and founder of the gnostic race (immovable race, seed of [Y]), and thus are considered pseudepigraphic.

 the famous historian of first century, josephus mentions in his antiquities, a story where [Y], son of [X], leaves some stone tablets inscribed with esoteric information for his future offspring high in the mountains.

stele one assumes the voice of [Y], and then of [Y] together with ger[X]as praising their respective creators.

hymn 1: [Y]'s hymn to piger[X]as (the divine [X]) and autogenes (the self-generated)

emmakha [Y]’s praise of the ger[X]as is, as the title indicates a hymn dedicating to the glorifying of [Y]’s father, ger[X]as, better known as [X]as, or [X].

 the hymn is from the perspective of emmakha [Y], his spiritual archetype, and when he refers to ger[X]as he is likewise referring to [X]’s spiritual archetype which resides in the lowest realm within barbelo.

 he praises ger[X]s for creating him ([Y]) and praises “god” for creating ger[X]as.

 the actual lineage the author is likely referring to is that [X], was derived from barbelo, who resides over [X], [Y], and the rest of the lower realms, while barbelo itself was derived from the invisible parent.

praise of the barbelo takes on the voice of both ger[X]as and [Y] who are jointly praising barbelo since this is ultimately where they derive from and where they reside in their spiritual archetype forms.

stele 2 assumes the collective voices of [Y] and ger[X]s in praise of the barbelo.

hymn 3: praise of the barbelo begins on the second stele and continues to praise barbelo as both [Y] and ger[X]as, beginning with “masculine, virgin, first aeon…”  verse 121:20 this hymn tends to focus more on the barbelo and its prominent role being a self-reflection of the one.

 this hymn also takes on the voice of more than just [Y] and [X] (“we all praise you”)

 the silence referred to is the climax moment of contemplation in ascension, where the soul resides in the third and highest realm within barbelo, at which point the descension back to the first realm where [X] and [Y] reside begins, blessing the other realms on the way down.

 [X] laughed, and "said in his heart, 'shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall sarah, that is ninety years old, bear [a child]?'" immediately after [X]'s encounter with god, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and [Y] (age 13), circumcised.

[Y] was fourteen years old when [X]'s son isaac was born to sarah.

 when she found [Y] teasing isaac, sarah told [X] to send both [Y] and hagar away.

early the next morning, [X] brought hagar and [Y] out together.

 according to the bible, reflecting the change of his name to "[X]" meaning "a father of many nations", [X] is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the bible, among others the israelites, [Y]ites, edomites, amalekites, kenizzites, midianites and assyrians, and through his nephew lot he was also related to the moabites and ammonites.

george segal created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work [X]'s farewell to [Y].

 this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by [X] when sarah demanded that he expel hagar and [Y].

 the tribes of central west arabia called themselves the "people of [X] and the offspring of [Y].

 the "arabized arabs" (mustaʿribah) of central arabia (najd) and north arabia, descending from [Y] the elder son of [X], through adnan (hence, adnanites).

 the book of jubilees claims that the sons of [Y] intermingled with the 6 sons of keturah, from [X], and their descendants were called arabs and [Y]ites:

 "arabized arabs" () or adnanites, taken to be the descendants of [Y] son of [X].

 but of course we must add since the commandment applies to [Y] as well as to issac, circumcision is the mark uniting those singular peoples, descended from [X], who recall not only his chastity but above all his dread in the presence of god; who share in that dread, and who understand the dread and the circumcision to be in part their response as mortal, hence reproductive, hence sexual creatures — created in the image of god — to the presence of the holy or pure god who as creator utterly transcends his mortal, reproductive creatures, and especially their sexuality.

 in genesis, these include three different accounts of a patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of [X] sending hagar and [Y] into the desert.

 through hagar, [X] fathers [Y].

 the first covenant is between god and all living creatures, and is marked by the sign of the rainbow; the second is with the descendants of [X] ([Y]ites and others as well as israelites), and its sign is circumcision; and the last, which does not appear until the book of exodus, is with israel alone, and its sign is sabbath.

 jews believe it is the site where [X] tried to sacrifice his son, isaac, while muslims believe that [X] tried to sacrifice his son, [Y], in mecca.

 although this was [X]'s second son ([X]'s first son was [Y], with hagar) it was sarah's first and only child.

after isaac had been weaned, sarah saw [Y] mocking, and urged her husband to cast out hagar the bondservant and her son, so that isaac would be [X]'s sole heir.

isaac, along with [Y], is highly important for muslims for continuing to preach the message of monotheism after his father [X].

 in the quran, it later narrates that [X] also praised god for giving him [Y] and isaac in his old age (14: 39–41).

elsewhere in the quran, isaac is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers [X], isaac and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "[X], [Y] and isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "[X], [Y], isaac, jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84).

according to the book of idols, descendants of the son of [X] ([Y]) who had settled in mecca migrated to other lands.

 in both jewish and muslim tradition, the jewish and arab peoples are descended from the two sons of [X]—isaac and [Y], respectively.

 according to muslim tradition, muhammad himself was a hanif and one of the descendants of [Y], son of [X].

 after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found for a historical [X] or [Y].

", while  commands the believers of islam to "say: we believe in god and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto [X] and [Y] and isaac and jacob and the tribes, and that which moses and jesus received, and which the prophets received from their lord.

 some of those that were mentioned are: adam, noah, [X], [Y], jacob, moses, and jesus and his apostles are all considered to be muslims in the qur'an.

 the great mosque of mecca, known as the masjid al-haram, is home to the ka'bah, believed by muslims to have been built by [X] and [Y].

in the islamic view, the beginnings of mecca are attributed to the biblical figures, [X], hagar and [Y].

 the civilization of mecca is believed to have started after ibrāhīm ([X]) left his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar (hagar) in the valley at allah's command.

 this is another irony in modern politics: the palestinians in truth are blood brothers or cousins of the modern israelis — they are all descendants of [X] and [Y], so to speak.

witnessed in the year 1800 bc with the arrival of the father of the prophets, prophet ibrahīm (the biblical [X]) to egypt during the occupation of the hyksos, and he married an egyptian slave girl named hajar (biblical hagar) from pelusium (modern-day northern qantara), and gave birth to prophet isma'īl (the biblical [Y]).

 this ritual is based on the islamic tradition that, when god ordered [X] to sacrifice his son [Y], satan tempted him three times not to do it, and, each time, [X] responded by throwing seven stones at him.

 adam, enoch, noah, eber, shelah, [X], lot, [Y], isaac, jacob, joseph, job, jethro, david, solomon, elijah, elisha, jonah, aaron, moses, zechariah, john the baptist and jesus are mentioned in the quran as prophets of god (see prophets of islam).

 saracens were associated with [Y]ites (descendants of [X]'s older son [Y]) in some strands of jewish, christian, and islamic genealogical thinking.

 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that [Y]ites chose to be called saracens in order to identify with [X]'s "free" wife sarah, rather than as hagarenes, which would have highlighted their association with [X]'s "slave woman" hagar.

 to justify this view, it references a passage of the quran, which mentions that the sons of yaʿqūb (jacob) referred to his uncle ismāʿīl ([Y]), father is-ḥāq (isaac) and grandfather ibrāhīm ([X]) as his ābāʾ ():

many muslims still claim descent from rechab, along with the nearly-universal claim of arabs to be descended from [X] through [Y] (ismail).

 there has been a historical account of rams' horns preserved in the kaaba until the year 683, which are believed to be the remains of the sacrifice of [Y] - the first son of [X], who most muslims believe was the son [X] tied down and almost sacrificed, and not isaac.

the scriptures have traced the patronymic lineage of the seventy nations to the three sons of noah, as also the lineage of [X] and [Y], and of jacob and esau.

the next burial in the cave is that of [X] himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons isaac and [Y].

in legends of the jews, rabbi louis ginzberg argues that the binding of isaac is a way for god to test isaac's claim to [Y], and to silence satan's protest about [X] who had not brought up any offering to god after isaac was born, also to show a proof to the world that [X] is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of god's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:

 one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than [Y] (notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari) interpreting the verse "god's perfecting his mercy on [X] and isaac" as referring to his making [X] his closest one, and to his rescuing isaac.

according to the islamic faith, [X] ( ) was a prophet and messenger of god, and an ancestor to the [Y]ite arabs and israelites.

 muslims believe that the kaaba in mecca was built by [X] and his son [Y] as the first house of worship on earth.

 [X] and isma'il ([Y]) further established the rites of pilgrimage, or Ḥajj ('pilgrimage'), which are still followed by muslims today.

 [X] had two children, [Y] and isaac, who both later became prophets.

 when [Y] was grown, someone appeared to [X], invites him to keep his vow.

 when [Y] was grown, someone appeared to [X] in a dream and said to him: "keep your vow which you made! god bestowed upon you a boy by hagar so that you may sacrifice him" so he said to [Y]: "let us go offer a sacrifice to god!" so he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains.

the second strand, provided by tabari, states that [X] was about to sacrifice his son [Y], and iblis appeared in form of a man to prevent the sacrifice.

 iblis, the enemy of god, gave up on [X] but then he encountered [Y], who was behind [X] carrying the wood and the large knife.

 iblis said to her: "oh mother of [Y]! do you realize where [X] is going with [Y]?" she replied: "they have gone to gather wood for us in the mountains".

 other verses mention the near-sacrifice of [X]'s son, whose name is not given but is presumed to be [Y] as the following verses mention the birth of isaac.

 the quran also repeatedly establishes [X]'s role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including isaac, jacob and [Y].

 the quran mentions that [X] and [Y] were the reformers who set up the ka‘bah in mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheism the quran consistently refers to islam as "the religion of [X]" (millat ibrahim) and [X] is given a title as hanif (the pure, "true in faith" or "upright man").

 certain episodes from the life of [X] have been more heavily detailed in islamic text, such as the arguments between [X] and the evil king, nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of hagar and [Y], which muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in mecca.

 an important islamic religious holiday, eid al-adha, commemorates [X]'s willingness to sacrifice his son [Y] as an act of obedience to god, before god intervened to provide him with a sheep to sacrifice instead.

 the sacrifice of [X]: isaac or [Y]?

 examples were often presented and discussed in later jewish exegesis with, according to [X] joshua heschel (1907-1972), an ongoing discourse between those who would follow the views of rabbi [Y] (born 90 ce) that "the torah speaks in human language", compared to the more mystical approach of rabbi akiva ( 50 – 135 ce) that any such deviations should signpost some deeper order or purpose, to be divined.

1659: [X] casting out hagar & [Y] – guilford college collection, greensboro, north carolina

the region, according to islamic tradition, is the birthplace of the islamic prophet muhammad, who was born in mecca, which is locally considered to have been founded by the islamic prophets [X] and [Y], and matriarch hagar.

era of [X] and [Y] 

according to arab and islamic sources, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm ([X]) brought his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar (hagar) here, for the latter two to stay.

 she would ultimately demand that [X] send hagar and [Y] away and so, [X] banished them and sent them into the desert.

sometime after the birth of [Y] but before the birth of isaac, sarah and [X] travel to gerar, as described in genesis 20, where events took place which mirrored those of mizraim, in which a king, this time abimelech, took an interest in sarah for her beauty and, as he had done in mizraim, [X] presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so, believing her unmarried abimelech took her into her house as pharaoh had though, this time, yahweh intervened before he touched sarah, through dreams and plague.

 however, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with [X], hagar, and [Y].

 she is not portrayed as [X]'s sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of terah's brother, haran, and hagar is not portrayed as [X]'s mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that sarah feels for hagar during her pregnancy and toward [Y].

 the firstborn son of [X], [Y], is considered by muslims to be the father of the arabs.

[Y] - the first-born son of [X] - has 12 sons/princes (genesis 25:16), and jacob also has 12 sons, who are the progenitors of the twelve tribes of israel.

 muslims hold isaac in deep veneration because they believe that both isaac and his older half-brother [Y] continued their father's spiritual legacy through their subsequent preaching of the message of god after the death of [X].

 isaac was the age of 10 when his half-brother [Y] went out from [X]’s house into the desert.

 in the quran, it later narrates that [X] also praised god for giving him [Y] and isaac in his old age (xiv: 39-41).

elsewhere in the quran, isaac is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers [X], isaac and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); yaʿqūb's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "[X], [Y] and isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "[X], [Y], isaac, jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; iii: 84).

[Y] was the first son of [X] through the egyptian hagar (), the common patriarch of the [X]ic religions, and is venerated by muslims as a prophet.

in , the birth of [Y] was planned by the patriarch [X]'s first wife, who at that time was known as sarai.

 god would make of [Y] a great nation because he was of the seed of [X].

 when [Y] was born, [X] was 86 years old.

when he was 13 years old, [Y] was circumcised at the same time as all other males in [X]'s household, becoming a part of the covenant in a mass circumcision.

 god told [X] that he would establish his covenant through isaac, and when [X] inquired as to [Y]'s role, god answered that [Y] has been blessed and that he "will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and i will make him a great nation.

a year later, [Y]'s half-brother isaac was born to [X] by his first wife sarah when she was 90 years old (), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ().

on the day of feasting during which [X] celebrated the weaning of isaac, [Y] was "mocking" or "playing with" isaac (the hebrew word ,  is ambiguous) and sarah asked [X] to expel [Y] and his mother, saying: "get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son isaac.

" her demand was painful for [X], who loved  [Y].

 [X] agreed only after god told him that "in isaac your seed shall be called", and that god would "make a nation of the son of the bondwoman" [Y], since he was a descendant of [X] (), god having previously told [X] "i will establish my covenant with [isaac]", while also making promises concerning the [Y]ite nation ().

 the lord's covenant made clear [Y] was not to inherit [X]'s house and that isaac would be the seed of the covenant: "take your son, your only son, whom you love and go to the region of moriah.

[X] gave [Y] and his mother a supply of bread and water and sent them away.

[Y] appeared with isaac at the burial of [X].

some pre-islamic poetry mentions [Y], his father [X], and a sacrifice story, such as the pre-islamic poet "umayyah ibn abi as-salt", who said in one of his poems:  ([the sacrifice] of his first-born of whose separation he [[X]] could not bear neither could he see him surrounded in foes).

also, some of the tribes of central west arabia called themselves the "people of [X] and the offspring of [Y]", as evidenced by a common opening of speeches and harangues of reconciliation between rival tribes in that area.

in judaism, [Y] was inclined towards many things [X] considered wicked.

 according to the book of genesis, in the hebrew bible, isaac rather than [Y] was the true heir of the [X]ic tradition and covenant, while at the same time being blessed by god with a great nation.

according to other jewish commentators, [Y]'s mother hagar is identified with keturah, the woman [X] sought out and married after sarah's death.

 like christians and jews, muslims believe that [Y] was the firstborn of [X], born to him from his wife sarah's slave, hagar.

 in other chapters of the quran, however, which date from the medina period, [Y] is mentioned closely with his father [X]: [Y] stands alongside [X] in their attempt to set up the kaaba in mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage and [X] thanks god for granting him [Y] and isaac in his old age.

 [Y] is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations and jacob's sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, "[X], [Y] and isaac", when testifying their faith.

 in the quranic narrative of the near-sacrifice of [X]'s son, the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was [Y], tabari maintained that it was isaac, consistent with the hebrew scriptures.

 hagar soon bore [Y], who was the first son of [X].

 god then instructed [X] to take hagar and [Y] to the desert and leave them there.

[X] returned and visited [Y] at various times throughout his life.

 at one time, according to a tradition of muhammad, [X] had arrived when his son was out and [X] visited with [Y]'s wife.

 [X] decided to leave before seeing his son, but based upon the complaints [Y]'s wife made in response to his questions, he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home, which was "change his threshold.

 some time after this, [X] returned to visit [Y] and again [Y] was out.

 [X] talked with [Y]'s new wife and found her answers indicated faith in god and contentment with her husband.

" when [Y] returned that night, he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of [X]'s visit.

 islamic traditions hold that the kaaba was first built by adam and that [X] and [Y] rebuilt the kaaba on the old foundations.

the scriptures of the baháʼí faith state that it was [Y], and not isaac, who was the son [X] almost sacrificed.

the name [Y] is biblical in origin: in genesis 16:1-16; 17:18-25; 21:6-21; 25:9-17, [Y] was the son of [X] by the servant hagar.

 at intervals came from his studio such pieces as the red cross knight, [X] offering up isaac, hagar and [Y] in the wilderness, the death of major peirson, the arrest of five members of the commons by charles the first, the siege of gibraltar, the surrender of admiral dewindt to lord camperdown, the offer of the crown to lady jane grey by the dukes of northumberland and suffolk, the resurrection, and others.

 in islam the kaaba is believed to be a sacred site built by the prophets [X] and [Y], and that its use as the qibla was ordained by god in several verses of the quran revealed to muhammad in the second hijri year.

 according to the quran, it was built by [X] and [Y], both of whom are prophets in islam.

 according to islamic tradition was rebuilt by ibrahim ([X]) and his son ismail ([Y]).

yet another creation myth puts the origin of the arabian in the time of [Y], the son of [X].

 [X]'s firstborn son, through hagar, [Y], became the progenitor of the [Y]ites, generally taken to be the arabs.

 she was so upset by the idea of [Y] inheriting their wealth, that she demanded that [X] send hagar and her son away.

 [X] was greatly distressed but god told [X] to do as his wife commanded because god's promise would be carried out through isaac; [Y] would be made into a great nation as well because he was [X]'s offspring.

 later, before [X] died, he gave gifts to [Y] and his other sons and sent them away from isaac (gen 25:6).

 [Y] and isaac buried [X] together (gen 25:9).

early the next morning, [X] brought hagar and [Y] out together.

the quranic narrative slightly differs from the biblical account: it is allah alone who commands [X] to take hagar and [Y] down to the desert, later mecca, and leave them there.

hājar or haajar (arabic: هاجر), is the arabic name used to identify the wife of [X] (arabic: ibrāhīm) and the mother of [Y] (arabic: ismā'īl).

 [X] and [Y]

 [X]'s great grandson joseph, after being thrown into a pit by his brothers, was sold to either midianites or [Y]ites.

, it was shem who circumcised [X] and [Y] on the day of atonement; and the blood of the covenant then shed is ever before god on that day to serve as an atoning power.

 it honors the willingness of ibrahim ([X]) to sacrifice his son ismail ([Y]) as an act of obedience to allah's command.

in islamic tradition, bakkah is where hagar and [Y] (ismā'īl) settled after being taken by [X] (ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story parallel to the bible's book of genesis (21:14-21)(but see below for the biblical geography).

 genesis tells that [X] gave hagar a bottle of water, and that hagar and [Y] ran out of water to drink in beer-sheba.

in addition to the islamic tradition that hagar and [Y] settled in bakkah, the quran relates that [X] came to mecca to help his son [Y] build the kaaba adjacent to the well of zamzam.

 [Y] is mentioned in genesis at [X]'s funeral.

 the nabataeans have been identified with the nebaioth of the hebrew bible, the descendants of [Y], [X]'s son.

the quran states that noah was inspired by allah, like other prophets such as ibrāhīm ([X]), ismā'īl ([Y]), ishaq (isaac), ya'qub (jacob), isa (jesus), ilyas (elijah), ayyub (job), harun (aaron), yunus (jonah), dawud (david) and muhammad, and that he was a faithful messenger.

ali's mother, fatimah bint asad, also belonged to the banu hashim; it is said that this made ali a descendant of [Y], the firstborn son of [X] ().

 muslims believe that he preached the same monotheistic faith as did his forefathers: [X] (ibrāhīm), [Y] (ismail) and isaac (ishaaq).

the quran also mentions that [X] taught the faith of pure monotheism to his sons, [Y] and isaac, as well as jacob.

 the quran records [X] telling [Y], isaac and jacob: "oh my sons! allah hath chosen the faith for you; then die not except in the faith of islam.

 although the death-bed scene is embellished upon in jewish tradition, and mentioned in the book of genesis, the quran mentions it to emphasize the notion that [X], isaac, [Y], and jacob were all muslims, as they bowed down in full faith to god and god alone.

 on the first branch was written "[X], friend of god," on the second, "isaac, pure of god," on the third, "[Y], sacrifice of god", on the fourth, "jacob, israelite of god," and on the fifth, "joseph, righteous of god.

 he also appears twice to hagar, the slave-girl who has [X]'s first child, [Y] ().

 after adam and his son seth, and after six nātiq–sāmad silsila (noah–shem), ([X]–[Y]), (moses–aaron), (jesus–simeon, son of jacob), (muhammad–ali); the silsila of nātiqs and sāmads have been completed with muhammad ibn isma'il.

traditional jewish interpretation, and that of most christian commentators, define [X]'s descendants as [X]'s seed only through his son isaac and his grandson jacob, to the exclusion of [Y] and esau.

 this was based on their hereditary duty to act as stewards and caretakers of the pilgrims coming to mecca to worship at the kaaba, the sacred shrine that in islamic tradition was built by ibrahim ([X]) and his first-born son and heir ismail ([Y]) was a monotheist site of worship.

all three jamarāt represent the devil: the first and largest represents his temptation of [X] against sacrificing [Y] (ismāʿīl); the second represents the temptation of [X]'s wife hagar (hājar) to induce her to stop him; the third represents his temptation of [Y] to avoid being sacrificed.

 a few yards away, the mosque also houses the maqam ibrahim ("[X]'s station") shrine containing a petrosomatoglyph (of feet) associated with the patriarch and his son [Y]'s building of the kaaba in islamic tradition.

according to islamic tradition, [X] and [Y], his son by hagar, built the kaʿbah as the house of god.

 additionally, humphrey commented on the name, with [Y] of the bible being a bastard son of [X] and progenitor of the arab people, considered "paradigmatic" by christians and jews alike.

 abram fathered [Y] and then as [X] fathered isaac, zimran, jokshan, medan, midian, ishbak and shuah.

the sayyids are by definition a branch of banu hashim, which traces its lineage to adnan, and therefore directly descends from [Y] (ismaeyl), and collaterally descends from his paternal half-brother isaac (ishaaq), the sons of [X] (ibrahim) .

according to ibn ishaq, the buraq transported [X] when he visited hagar and [Y].

 9 and his sons isaac and [Y] buried him in the cave of machpelah, in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite, which is before mamre; 10 the field which [X] purchased of the sons of heth: there was [X] buried, and sarah his wife.

there is disagreement amongst jewish scholars as to whether keturah was, or was not, the same person as hagar (known in islam as hājar)—a handmaid of [X]'s wife sarah, and [X]'s concubine (or, in islamic tradition, his second wife)—who, together with her son [Y], was sent away by [X] at the insistence of sarah.

 in flight to canada, [Y] reed deals playfully with anachronisms, [X] lincoln using a telephone for example.

 mcconkie (1980) notes that joseph smith is reported to have said that within the lost 116 pages lehi's friend, [Y] (not to be confused with [X]'s son [Y]), who joined lehi in escaping jerusalem, was revealed to be a descendant of ephraim.

 for instance, in the dismissal of hagar and [Y] (1653, metropolitan museum of art, new york) maes portrays [X] banishing the handmaiden hagar along with their son, [Y].

 according to muslim tradition, muhammad himself was a ḥanīf and a descendant of [Y], son of [X].

the historical existence of hanifs is disputed by scholars, and after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found showing that [Y] and [X] really existed.

a greek source from the fifth century ce, "the ecclesiastical history of sozomen", speaks of how "[X] had bequeathed a monotheist religion" to arabs, that the arabs descended "from [Y] and hagar" and followed jewish practices such as not eating pork.

 despite this, they still claim to be the heirs of [X] and [Y] and the custodians of the baytullah (house of god) built by them.

  the windows in the nave above the east arcade depict the following old testament figures: [X], hagar and her child [Y], moses, pharaoh's daughter, joshua, and deborah.

the priestly source illustrates history in genesis by compiling the genealogy beginning with the "generations of the heavens and the earth" and continuing through [X], [Y], and isaac to the descendants of jacob and esau.

 after this, musaylimah referred to a biblical covenant between god and [X] in which isaac was promised the linage for the inheritance of the land of canaan and [Y] for unspecified kingdoms.

in islamic tradition, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm ([X]) left his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar (hagar) in the valley, which muslims believe was a command by god.

this sura also references noah, job, [X], isaac, jacob, [Y], and elijah.

 during the individual interviews, steve reich and beryl korot asked questions such as "who is [X]?", "who is sarah?" and "who is [Y]?" and recorded answers that were given by israeli, palestinian and american interviewees.

 hagar gave birth to [X]'s firstborn son [Y], and after sarah gave birth to her own son isaac, she resented hagar and made [X] "cast her into the wilderness".

the two eids, eid ul-fitr and eid ul-adha, commemorate the passing of the month of fasting, ramadan, and the willingness of ibrahim([X])to sacrifice his son ismael([Y]) for allah.

according to islamic mythology, god instructed adam to construct a building (called the kaaba) to be the earthly counterpart of the house of heaven and that ibrahim ([X]) and ismail ([Y]) later rebuilt it on its original foundations after was destroyed in the flood of nuh (noah).

reu or ragau (; ) in genesis was the son of peleg and the father of serug, thus being [X]'s great-great-grandfather and the ancestor of the israelites and [Y]ites.

 he is also the great-grandfather of the prophet and patriarch [X], thus the ancestor of the [Y]ites and the israelites.

now these are the generations of [Y], [X]'s son, whom hagar the egyptian, sarah's handmaid, bore unto [X].

and esau saw that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father; so esau went unto [Y], and took unto the wives that he had mahalath the daughter of [Y], [X]'s son, the sister of nebaioth, to be his wife.

the [Y]ite story begins when [X] (ibrahim) and hagar (hajar) bear the prophetic child, who was named [Y] (ismail) in the order of god (allah) through one of his angels.

 god ordered [X] to take his son [Y] and wife hagar to present-day mecca.

god then ordered [X] to rebuild the mosque for [Y]'s tribe, which was previously constructed by the first islamic prophet adam.

 both [X] and his son [Y] started building the kaaba.

 [X] was building the mosque while his son was providing him the stones, and when the walls were built, [Y] brought the large stone for [X] to build the roof, which was called maqam ibrahim.

when [Y] left, the angel gabriel (jibril) appeared with the beautiful white stone and told [X] that the black stone ( belongs to the jannah and adam and eve (adam and hawa), the first human beings.

 [X] threw himself on his face and laughed at the thought that a child could be born to a man of a hundred and a woman of ninety, and [X] asked god to bless [Y].

 the scrolls of [X] are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to [X], and later used by [Y] and isaac.

 that in the old testament, child sacrifice was prohibited, but this prohibition wasn't always obeyed; that a man's sexual history was never an issue (thus no such thing as a virginity requirement for men); the only religiously celibate jews were the essenes, but this was contrary to mainstream judaism; saint peter was married; saint paul thought that saint joseph had fathered jesus; "joseph 'did not know' mary 'until she has given birth to a son'" (she did not remain virgin, according to saint matthew), prophets were both male and female, the priesthood and the rabbinate were for men only, but phoebe was a deacon and junia was an apostle, the bible states that men are superior to women, polygyny was frequent, abortions were so rare that they were not a problem for the authors of the bible, but there was a ritual meant for making unfaithful women abort; the books of the bible were "kind of hypertext", yahweh visited [X], [Y] has probably sexually abused isaac; the bible does not state if adam and eve were married; there are biblical laws regulating polygyny, and "concubine" meant "secondary wife"; abishag laid with david but he was impotent, widows, rape victims and divorced women were "used goods", thus unworthy of a priest; the bible is inconsistent on divorce and "pervasively patriarchal"; the ten commandments were intended for jewish men only; marriage meant transfer of property, but women were inferior to real estate; adultery was about property rights; in the hebrew bible there was no ban on men having sex with unmarried women (including prostitutes); in david's time jerusalem had only a few thousand inhabitants; father-daughter incest was only a devaluation of daughter's value; onan was not masturbating; the bible is inconsistent about brother-sister incest; sex with a woman was prohibited during her period, but so is wearing wool and linen; david and jonathan were not sexual partners; sodom's sin was being inhospitable to strangers and "mistreatment of the powerless"; saint jude does not say that sodom's sin was homosexuality; "sacred prostitution" nowhere and "never took place"; the hebrew bible does not say anything about lesbianism, but saint paul thought that god made homosexuals so; jesus said very little about sexuality; the bible is opposed to homosexuality; having sex with prostitutes was seen as a way of losing money and saint paul opposed the use of prostitutes, but "judah's use of a prostitute was normal and acceptable", this also applies to samson, who also foreshadowed suicide bombers; mary magdalene wasn't a prostitute; god has reproductive organs and had a wife/wives; jews were initially polytheist, genesis 1:26-27 says that the elohim were male and female and humans were made in their image; god's sons had sex with women; yahweh is a sexual being, wisdom was god's wife, gods used to have children in many mythologies, israel was god's wife (polygyny wasn't a problem for him); "all theology is metaphor" and yahweh was "an insanely jealous and abusive husband".

[Y] was the first son of [X]; his mother was hagar.

[Y] and hagar taken to mecca by [X]

[Y] and hagar being taken to mecca by [X] in islamic texts is an important part in the story of [Y], as it brings the focus to mecca and is the beginning of mecca's sanctification as a holy area.

 islamic tradition says [X] was ordered by god to take hagar and [Y] to mecca, and later [X] returned to mecca to build the kaaba.

 in many of these accounts, the sakina (something like a wind or spirit sent by god), or the angel gabriel (jibral) guides them to the location of the kaaba, at which point [X] builds it and afterwards, leaves the other two there (other versions discussed below say the construction of the kaaba occurred later and that [Y] took part in it).

 generally, it is said that hagar asks [X] who he is entrusting herself and [Y] to as he leaves them.

muslims believe that [X] was told to sacrifice his son, [Y], though the qur'an does not mention the name of the son.

 some versions tell of the devil trying to stop god's command from being obeyed by visiting hagar, [Y], and [X].

 every time the devil says [X] is going to sacrifice [Y], each person answers that if god commanded it, they should obey.

 eventually, [X] tells [Y] about the order and [Y] is willing to be sacrificed and encourages [X] to listen to god.

after many generations of [X] have passed from the lines of [Y] and seth, the world becomes corrupted by human sin and nephilim, and god wants to wipe out humanity for their wickedness.

 [X] is said to be perfect until he recognises either his sin or [Y]'s fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world.

an area of questioning involved the book of genesis, including questions about whether eve was actually created from [X]'s rib, where [Y] got his wife, and how many people lived in ancient egypt.

dual seedline christian identity proponents— those who believe that eve bore children with satan as well as with [X] —believe that eve was seduced by the serpent (satan), shared her fallen state with [X] by having sex with him, and gave birth to twins with different fathers: satan's son [Y] and [X]'s son abel.

 [X] and eve are driven out of the garden by father into the wasteland surrounding the garden and have two children, [Y] and abel ("the expulsion" and "the wasteland").

several years later, [X], eve, [Y], and abel continue their lives, hoping and praying that father will one day bring them home to eden.

 [Y] complains to abel that their parents won't let them see the world beyond the glen and that [X] and eve seemingly let themselves get kicked out of eden ("lost in the wilderness").

[X] and eve, deeply worried about [Y]'s safety out in the wasteland, find some comfort in the fact that they have been able to create a life and family for themselves outside of eden ("close to home"), but this peacefulness is once again shattered when [Y], back from his journey, tells the family that he has found a ring of giant stones, seemingly providing evidence of other humans.

 [X]'s betrayal quickly leads to a family-wide fight, culminating in [Y] threatening to leave forever and taking abel with him.

 [Y], beginning to leave, is forcibly stopped by [X], who slaps [Y], which sends him to the ground.

 [Y] tells [X] that he will kill him and the two attempt to fight, but when abel intervenes, he is thrown off [Y], who, in his rage, beats him to death with a stone ("the death of abel").

 [Y] leaves the remaining members of his family, telling [X] that it should have been him that should be dead.

 she attempts to speak to father about [Y]'s departure from the family, [X]'s grief over the loss of both his sons, the birth of another son, seth, who has since had children of his own, and [X]'s recent death.

  it escalates into a fight, directly mirroring the one between [X] and [Y] generations ago, and it is only because yonah intervenes that one of the brothers is not killed.

 some pre-[X]ite theorists held the view that [Y] left his family for an inferior tribe described variously as "nonwhite mongols" or that [Y] took a wife from one of the inferior pre-[X]ic peoples.

 identity preacher conrad gaard wrote that the serpent was a "beast of the field", was the father of [Y], and since [Y] married a pre-[X]ite, his descendants were a "mongrel, hybrid race".

 the belief's adherents commonly use it to justify antisemitism and racism by claiming that jews or members of non-white races are the descendants of [Y] and the serpent, who they variably interpret to be satan or an intelligent non-human creature which lived before [X] and eve.

 the doctrine frames human history as a conflict between these two races in which the descendants of [X] will eventually triumph over the descendants of [Y] and the serpent.

 because the biblical record explicitly names [X] as the father of [Y], the teaching of the serpent seed is considered incompatible with the protestant teaching of biblical infallibility.

 the most famous of [X]'s children are [Y] and abel.

in the second-season episode "pegasus", admiral helena [Y] cites [X]a's closure of the tribunal in denying his request for a jury court-martial for helo and tyrol.

" [Y] relates to [X]a and president laura roslin how she ordered a risky maneuver to escape the initial cylon attack on the twelve colonies.

 [X]a recognizes [Y] as his superior officer, but [Y] promises not to interfere with galacticas internal affairs.

[Y] declines to resupply the fleet's civilian ships and integrates the battlestars' crews, transferring apollo and starbuck to pegasus over commander [X]a's objections.

 [X]a reiterates his willingness to follow [Y], to both roslin and tigh, and insists that apollo and starbuck obey their transfer orders.

 [Y] denies [X]a's request that helo and tyrol be given a jury court-martial and sentences them both to death for murder and treason.

 [X]a demands that [Y] return them to galactica and orders vipers to escort a marine assault team to pegasus.

a conversation between [Y] and [X]a makes clear that pegasus is much larger, more advanced, and more powerful than galactica.

davis compares [X]a's defiance of [Y] to apollo's mutiny in "kobol's last gleaming".

 eick says the amount [X]a looks at [Y] in "pegasus" indicates that he respects her.

 moore abandoned several elements of the original-series episode involving [Y], "the living legend"; the main similarities in his view are [Y] appearing suddenly in the pegasus and being "more of a hardass character than commander [X]a.

" moore considers the key differences to be [Y]'s gender and her authority over [X]a.

in the episode, admiral helena [Y] and commander william [X]a call a truce but plan to assassinate each other.

 [Y] and [X]a both cancel their plots, but gina escapes from the pegasus brig and kills [Y].

 [X]a ordered galactica's vipers launched toward pegasus, and [Y] ordered the pegasus vipers to intercept them.

both viper groups seek permission to fire, but neither [Y] nor [X]a grants it.

 [Y] and [X]a call off their attacks and agree to meet on colonial one as neutral ground.

 later, roslin warns [X]a privately that [Y] will strike against [X]a again and urges him to assassinate [Y] first.

 realizing that roslin is right about [Y], [X]a orders starbuck to assassinate [Y] once the attack on the cylon fleet concludes.

 likewise, [Y] directs fisk to take a detachment of marines to galactica to kill [X]a after the attack.

 [Y] and [X]a contact fisk and starbuck respectively, but neither gives the order to assassinate.

[Y]'s decision not to kill [X]a demonstrates that she is "human and.

 however, the contrast between [Y]'s decision to pillage her civilian fleet and [X]a's decision to protect his reflects "an issue of character rather than humanizing circumstance" (emphasis clifton's).

starbuck is conflicted over her loyalty to [X]a and apollo and her hope that [Y] will help her rescue anders.

amanda keith of the los angeles newspaper group disputes starbuck's assertion in the eulogy that the fleet was safer with [Y] in command; keith attributes starbuck's assessment to dissatisfaction with [X]a and roslin's leadership and ignorance of [Y]'s past misdeeds.

 keith also believes roslin is mistaken in her assessment of [Y] as irredeemable; after all, [Y] did back down from killing [X]a.

instead of giving starbuck the order to kill [Y], [X]a muses, "it's not enough to survive.

" clifton compares the conflict between [Y]'s urge to fight the cylons and roslin and [X]a's commitment to maintaining civil society to the struggle between [X]a and roslin in the miniseries over whether to fight the cylons or flee.

 he cites [X]a and [Y]'s assassination plots and their regrets over them, [X]a inspecting his surgical scar, starbuck and fisks's mutual wishes of "good hunting", and apollo and gina's death wishes.

 clifton argues further that roslin pushes for [X]a to assassinate [Y] because she expects her cancer to kill her soon and considers baltar, who as vice president would succeed her, unfit to stand up to [Y].

 originally the conflict between [Y] and [X]a was to center around [Y]'s failure to protect civilian decoys during the battle with the cylons despite a promise to roslin.

 at one point during writing, the script explained why roslin does not promote [X]a over [Y] to defuse the situation: roslin knows [Y] does not accept her authority as president and would not obey [X]a's orders.

[Y]'s code word "case orange" for fisk to kill [X]a refers to war plan orange, a contingency plan developed by the american military before the second world war in case of a japanese attack.

 [Y]'s specific directive to "terminate [X]a's command, starting with [X]a" is an homage to a line delivered by harrison ford's character in apocalypse now referring to kurtz.

 [X]a's code word "downfall" for starbuck to kill [Y] refers to the german film of that name or possibly operation downfall, the planned allied invasion of japan at the end of the second world war.

 jacob clifton gave part 1 an a, praising the moral ambiguity around [Y]'s actions, olmos's performance, the editing of the final scene in which [Y] and [X]a give their assassination orders, and starbuck, [X]a, and fisk's reluctance to participate in the assassination plots.

 rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

” more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

rendsburg argued that the empire of [X] and [Y] provided the setting for the statement in  that god gave to abraham and his descendants “this land, from the river of egypt to the great river, the euphrates.

” rendsburg reasoned that this passage makes sense only in the period of [X] and [Y], as before [X] and [Y], it would have been unimaginable for an author to use these boundaries to define the land of israel, and after [X] and [Y], israel once more became a small state and those boundaries were an impossibility.

 rendsburg cited this as further support for his conclusion that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 rendsburg argued that the only time that an author would considered this necessary would be in the time of [X] and [Y], as before then, there were no kings (except for the transitional saul), and after then, kingship was a fait accompli.

 arguing that the only time that an author would need to justify kingship was when it was the new creation of israelite political theorists, rendsburg cited these verses as further evidence that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 the sifre cited as examples of admonition near death: (1) when abraham reproved abimelech in , (2) when isaac reproved abimelech, ahuzzath, and phicol in , (3) when joshua admonished the israelites in , (4) when samuel admonished the israelites in , and (5) when [X] admonished [Y] in .

 rendsburg explained genesis's interest with this motif by recalling that [X] was the youngest of jesse’s seven sons (see ), and [Y] was among the youngest, if not the youngest, of [X]’s sons (see ).

 the two remaining candidates were adonijah ([X]’s fourth son) and [Y], and although adonijah was older (and once claimed the throne when [X] was old and feeble in ), [Y] won out.

 an israelite could thus not criticize [X]’s selection of [Y] to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — isaac, jacob, judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

 more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

rendsburg read in  — which portrays the nations of moab and ammon, transjordanian states ruled by [X] and [Y], as descendants of the sons of lot (and thus the grandnephews of abraham) — to indicate that the author of genesis sought to portray the ancestors of these countries as related to the patriarchs in order to justify israelite rule over them.

 rendsburg noted further that  refers to “the land of moriah,” and this word occurs in the bible in only one other place,  “[Y] began to build the temple of yhvh in jerusalem on mount moriah, which appeared to [X] his father, and which [X] had prepared as the place, at the threshing floor of ornan (a variant of araunah) the jebusite.

 this destruction once was attributed to the 10th century bce campaigns by shishak, these cities therefore being ascribed to [X] and [Y] as proof of the bible's account of them, but the destruction layers have since been redated to the late 9th century bce campaign of hazael, and the cities to the time of the omride kings.

 the bible unearthed concludes that the biblical writers deliberately invented the empire, power, and wealth, of saul, [X], and [Y], by appropriating the deeds and achievements of the omrides, so that they could then denigrate the omrides and obscure their accomplishments, since these kings held a religious viewpoint that was anathema to the biblical editors.

 it was written by jane espenson and directed by [X] [Y], and aired on october 9, 2001 on upn.

  reports that king josiah commanded the israelites to keep the passover in jerusalem as part of josiah's reforms, but also notes that the israelites had not kept such a passover from the days of the biblical judges nor in all the days of the kings of israel or the kings of judah, calling into question the observance of even kings [X] and [Y].

 the sifre cited as further examples of admonition near death: (1) when abraham reproved abimelech in , (2) when isaac reproved abimelech, ahuzzath, and phicol in , (3) when joshua admonished the israelites in , (4) when samuel admonished the israelites in , and (5) when [X] admonished [Y] in .

gary rendsburg read in  — which personifies edom, a transjordanian state ruled by [X] and [Y], as the brother of jacob/israel — to indicate that the author of genesis sought to portray the ancestor of this country as related to the patriarchs in order to justify israelite rule over edom.

 2 samuel reports that while israel permitted the native kings of moab and ammon to rule as tributary vassals, israel deposed the king of edom, and [X] and [Y] exercised direct rule over their southeastern neighbor.

 rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

 rendsburg explained genesis's interest with this motif by recalling that [X] was the youngest of jesse’s seven sons (see ), and [Y] was among the youngest, if not the youngest, of [X]’s sons (see ).

 the two remaining candidates were adonijah ([X]’s fourth son) and [Y], and although adonijah was older (and once claimed the throne when [X] was old and feeble in ), [Y] won out.

 an israelite could thus not criticize [X]’s selection of [Y] to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — isaac, jacob, judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

 and in accordance with jacob's blessing, 30 kings descended from judah, for as  reports, [X] descended from judah, and if one counts [X], [Y], rehoboam, abijah, asa, jehoshaphat and his successors until jeconiah and zedekiah (one finds 30 generations from judah's son perez to zedekiah).

 more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

 these scholars thus date the blessing to the time of [X] or [Y].

reading the statement in  that “the ruler’s staff shall not depart from judah,” rendsburg saw recognition among tenth-century bce authors that kingship would continue with [X] and [Y]'s family from the tribe of judah.

 rendsburg cited this as further support for the argument that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 and in accordance with jacob's blessing, 30 kings descended from judah, for as  reports, [X] descended from judah, and if one counts [X], [Y], rehoboam, abijah, asa, jehoshaphat and his successors until jeconiah and zedekiah (one finds 30 generations from judah's son perez to zedekiah).

 god favored abel over cain in  isaac superseded ishmael in  jacob superseded esau in  judah (fourth among jacob’s sons, last of the original set born to leah) and joseph (eleventh in line) superseded their older brothers in  perez superseded zerah in  and  and ephraim superseded manasseh in  rendsburg explained genesis’s interest with this motif by recalling that [X] was the youngest of jesse’s seven sons (see ), and [Y] was among the youngest, if not the youngest, of [X]’s sons (see ).

 the issue of who among [X]’s many sons would succeed him dominates the succession narrative in  through  amnon was the firstborn, but was killed by his brother absalom ([X]’s third son) in  after absalom rebelled, [X]’s general joab killed him in  the two remaining candidates were adonijah ([X]’s fourth son) and [Y], and although adonijah was older (and once claimed the throne when [X] was old and feeble in ), [Y] won out.
