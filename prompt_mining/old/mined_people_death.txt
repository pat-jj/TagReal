 in 1972, [X] suggested that sihanouk leave beijing and tour the areas of [Y] under cpk control.

 [X] declared that "agriculture is key both to nation-building and to national defence"; he believed that unless [Y] could develop swiftly then it would be vulnerable to vietnamese domination, as it had been in the past.

chandler noted that while "[Y]'s revolution" under [X] produced "millions of victims", it also had some beneficiaries.

 chandler also noted that [X]'s supporters believed that it was "his clear-sighted strategies and tactics that had wrested control of [Y] from the united states and its feudal puppets" and that he had "uprooted enemies from the party, encouraged vigilance, built the alliance with china, and masterminded the four year plan.

" during the war with vietnam, many [Y]ns revered [X]'s khmer rouge forces as nationalists who were defending the country.
