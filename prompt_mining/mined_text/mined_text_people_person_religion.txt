the political scientist thomas pangle concluded:as [X] — the greatest legal scholar, and also the preeminent medical authority, in traditional [Y] — teaches, the most obvious purpose of circumcision is the weakening of the male sexual capacity and pleasure.

the myth that god created the world out of nothing – ex nihilo – is central today to [Y], christianity and islam, and the medieval jewish philosopher [X] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.

conservative [Y] both affirms belief in the world beyond (as referenced in the amidah and [X]' thirteen precepts of faith) while recognizing that human understanding is limited and we cannot know exactly what the world beyond consists of.

 [X], a centrally important medieval sage of [Y], lived at the time of the first emergence of kabbalah.

 rabbi yiḥyah founded yeshivot, rabbinical schools, and synagogues that featured a rationalist approach to [Y] based on the talmud and works of saadia gaon and [X] (rambam).

 in modern times, rationalists holding similar views as those of the dor de'ah movement have described themselves as "talmide ha-rambam" (disciples of [X]) rather than as being aligned with dor de'ah, and are more theologically aligned with the rationalism of modern orthodox [Y] than with orthodox Ḥasidic or Ḥaredi communities.

in his commentary on the mishnah (tractate sanhedrin, chapter 10), [X] formulates his "13 principles of faith"; and that these principles summarized what he viewed as the required beliefs of [Y]:

 [X] asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of [Y] about which there is no disagreement.

 one of the best-known statements of rabbinic [Y] on monotheism is the second of [X]' 13 principles of faith:

belief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of [Y], and is one of [X]' 13 principles of faith.

 furthermore, kellner criticizes the assumption within orthodox [Y] that there is an "ontological divide between jews and gentiles", which he believes is contrary to what [X] thought and the torah teaches, stating that "gentiles as well as jews are fully created in the image of god".

 according to steven schwarzschild, [X]' position has its source in his adoption of aristotle's skeptical attitude towards the ability of reason to arrive at moral truths, and "many of the most outstanding spokesmen of [Y] themselves dissented sharply from" this position, which is "individual and certainly somewhat eccentric" in comparison to other jewish thinkers.

while mainstream rabbinic [Y] is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of [X] (c.

jews pray for the messianic age of peace every day in the shmoneh esreh in addition to faith in the coming of the messianic age constituting one of the thirteen core principles of faith in [Y], according to [X].

 beliefs that god gave a "torah of truth" to moses (and the rest of the people), that moses was the greatest of the prophets, and that the law given to moses will never be changed, are three of the thirteen principles of faith of orthodox [Y] according to [X].

 in jacobs' and broyde's view, they were attracted by its glorification of man, its doctrine of immortality, and its ethical principles, which they saw as more in keeping with the spirit of talmudic [Y] than are those taught by the philosophers, and which was held in contrast to the view of [X] and his followers, who regarded man as a fragment of the universe whose immortality is dependent upon the degree of development of his active intellect.

at the same time, [X] - and other thinkers - recognizes   the paradox that will arise given (i) that [Y] simultaneously recognizes god's omniscience, and further (ii) the nature  of divine providence as understood in [Y].

 as noted, however, neither [X] nor his contemporaries viewed these principles as encompassing all of jewish belief, but rather as the core theological underpinnings of the acceptance of [Y].

 while defending [X] against hasdai and albo, he refused to accept dogmatic articles for [Y], criticizing any formulation as minimizing acceptance of all 613 mitzvot.

 in egypt, [X] resumed practicing [Y] openly only to be accused of apostasy.

 in talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in [Y], known as maaseh bereshith (the work of creation) and maaseh merkavah (the work of the chariot); [X] interprets these texts as referring to aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of torah.

 mendelssohn has been described as the "'third moses,' with whom begins a new era in [Y]," just as new eras began with moses the prophet and with moses [X].

some orthodox rationalists in israel take a "restorationist" approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify rabbinic [Y] and bring all jews, regardless of status or stream of [Y], closer to observance of halacha, mitzvot, kashrut and embrace of [X]' "13 principles of faith".

[X], one of [Y]'s most important theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why jesus was wrong to create christianity and why muhammad was wrong to create islam; he laments the pains jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant [Y] (in the case of christianity, called supersessionism).

orthodox [Y] maintains the 13 principles of faith as formulated by [X] in his introduction to chapter helek of the mishna torah.

 one famous muslim who converted to [Y] was ovadyah, famous from his contact with [X].

[X] endeavored to harmonize the philosophy of aristotle with [Y]; and to this end he composed the work, dalalat al-Ḥairin (guide for the perplexed)—known better under its hebrew title moreh nevuchim—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by jewish thinkers.

in a response, [X] discusses the relationship between [Y] and islam:

medieval, rationalist jewish philosophers (exponents of hakirah–rational "investigation" from first principles in support of [Y]), such as [X], describe biblical monotheism to mean that there is only one god, and his essence is a unique, simple, infinite unity.

as one of the towering figures in [Y] and the author of the mishneh torah commentary on the talmud, [X] also issued a landmark doctrinal response to the forced conversions of jews in the iberian peninsula by the almohads:

in his epistle on martyrdom, however, [X] suggested that the persecuted jew should publicly adopt islam while maintaining crypto-[Y] and not seek martyrdom unless forced to transgress jewish commandments in public.

 the jewish philosophers of the middle ages, such as [X], reconciled [Y] with greek philosophy.

 as a formative approach guidebook in [Y], the english translator of the first section, in his introduction, compares its position with [X]' guide for the perplexed, but contrasts the spiritual guidance aim of tanya with the philosophical aim of [X].

the jewish philosopher [X], who was heavily influenced by islamic and aristotelian thought, also set forth moderation as an ideal within [Y].

 setting aside the possible exception of the work of [X], it had a profound impact on the subsequent development of [Y], and has remained central to jewish religious tradition.

in the 12th century, the preeminent jewish scholar [X] codified core principles of modern [Y], writing "[god], the cause of all, is one.

[X] lamented the pains that jews felt as a result of new faiths that attempted to supplant [Y], specifically christianity and islam.

krauthammer's attachment to [Y] was strengthened through his study of [X] at mcgill university under rabbi david hartman.

 other segments of orthodox [Y] which share this perspective of the dor daim, while not necessarily rejecting the zohar itself, include most talmide ha-rambam (disciples of [X]), as well as portions of the modern orthodox community and others.

the idea that god created the world out of nothing (creatio ex nihilo) has become central today to islam, christianity, and [Y] – indeed, the medieval jewish philosopher [X] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared – yet it is not found directly in genesis, nor in the entire hebrew bible.

 if [X] had intended to stem the further development of talmud study by reducing it to the form of a code, raavad felt it his duty to oppose such an attempt, as contrary to the free spirit of rabbinical [Y], which refuses to surrender blindly to authority.

 communities where luria's thought holds less sway include many german and modern orthodox communities, groups carrying forward spanish and portuguese traditions, a sizable segment of baladi yemenite jews (see dor daim), and other groups that follow a form of torah [Y] based more on classical authorities like [X] and the geonim.

 the country is currently under the control of the t[X]ban, an [Y]ist political movement which returned to power in 2021 after a 20-year-long war with the united states and its allies.

 the t[X]ban emerged in september 1994 as a movement and militia of students (t[X]b) from [Y]ic madrassas (schools) in pakistan, who soon had military support from pakistan.

 the t[X]ban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of [Y]ic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many afghans, especially women.

 as of 16 august 2021, an unofficial coordination council led by senior statesmen was in the process of coordinating the transfer of the state institutions of the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan to the t[X]ban.

following the effective collapse of the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan during the 2021 t[X]ban offensive, the t[X]ban declared the country an [Y]ic emirate.

on 17 august 2021, the leader of the t[X]ban-affiliated hezb-e-[Y]i gulbuddin party, gulbuddin hekmatyar, met with both hamid karzai, the former president of afghanistan, and abdullah abdullah, the chairman of the high council for national reconciliation and former chief executive, in doha, qatar, with the aim of forming a government (though it is unclear whether either karzai or abdullah will be directly involved in any such government).

ibn sina (), also known as abu [X] sina (), pour sina (), and often known in the west as avicenna (;  – june 1037), was a persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, astronomers, thinkers and writers of the [Y]ic golden age, and the father of early modern medicine.

 the search for a definitive [Y]ic philosophy separate from occasion[X]sm can be seen in what is left of his work.

avicenna's theology on metaphysical issues (ilāhiyyāt) has been criticized by some [Y]ic scholars, among them al-ghaz[X], ibn taymiyya and ibn al-qayyim.

 avicenna wrote a number of short treatises de[X]ng with [Y]ic theology.

robert wisnovsky, a scholar of avicenna attached to the mcgill university, says that "avicenna was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in [Y], particularly in the fields of metaphysics, logic and medicine" but that his works didn't only have an influence in these "secular" fields of knowledge alone, as "these works, or portions of them, were read, taught, copied, commented upon, quoted, paraphrased and cited by thousands of post-avicennian scholars—not only philosophers, logicians, physicians and speci[X]sts in the mathematical or exact sciences, but also by those who speci[X]zed in the disciplines of ʿilm al-kalām (rational theology, but understood to include natural philosophy, epistemology and philosophy of mind) and usūl al-fiqh (jurisprudence, but understood to include philosophy of law, dialectic, and philosophy of language).

2021 – kabul falls into the hands of the t[X]ban as ashraf ghani flees afghanistan along with local residents and foreign nationals, effectively reestablishing the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 because of this, hasan [X] shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the ismaili form of [Y].

 the aga khan himself can be considered an [Y]ic modernist and an intellectual of the [X]garh movement.

like many other [Y]ic modernists, the aga khan held a low opinion of the traditional religious establishment (the ʿulamāʾ) as well as what he saw as their rigid form[X]sm, leg[X]sm, and liter[X]sm.

 he endorsed the spiritual equ[X]ty of men and women in [Y], and he also called for full political equ[X]ty.

 ibn zallu sent his student abdallah ibn yasin to preach m[X]kite [Y] to the sanhaja berbers of the adrar (present-day mauritania).

 they then came in contact with the barghawata, a berber tribal confederation, who followed an [Y]ic "heresy" preached by s[X]h ibn tarif three centuries earlier.

the almoravid movement started as a conservative [Y]ic reform movement inspired by the m[X]ki school of jurisprudence.

 bennison also challenges robert hillenbrand's characterization of the art of al-andalus and the maghreb as provincial and peripheral in consideration of [Y]ic art globally, and of the contributions of the almoravids as "sparse" as a result of the empire's "puritanical fervour" and "ephemer[X]ty.

at first, the almoravids, subscribing to the conservative m[X]ki school of [Y]ic jurisprudence, rejected what they perceived as decadence and a lack of piety among the iberian muslims of the andalusi taifa kingdoms.

 as for the foremost one in the matter of [Y] and faith, it was [X] ibn abi t[X]b.

 [X] ibn abi t[X]b was the first child to embrace [Y], for he has not even reached the age of puberty at that time, while abu bakr was the first free man to embrace [Y].

the naqshbandiyya: orthodoxy and activism in a worldwide sufi tradition by itzchak weismann, 2007, p24[Y]ic sufism by sirdar ikbal [X] shah, tractus books, 2000, p104 the shia imams jafar al-sadiq, musa al-kazim, [X] al-reza, muhammad al-jawad, [X] al-hadi, hasan al-askari and muhammad al-mahdi are all descended from abu bakr.

abu bakr had the distinction of being the first c[X]ph in the history of [Y] and also the first c[X]ph to nominate a successor.

 he was the only c[X]ph in the history of [Y] who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his c[X]phate.

 however, as sayed [X] asgher razwy notes in his book a restatement of the history of [Y] & muslims, muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep.

al qaeda aims to establish an [Y]ic state in the arab world, modelled after the rashidun c[X]phate, by initiating a global jihad against the "international jewish-crusader alliance" led by the united states, which it sees as the "external enemy" and against the secular governments in muslim countries, that are described as "the apostate domestic enemy".

following its 9/11 attack and in response to its condemnation by [Y]ic scholars, al-qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, "a statement from qaidat al-jihad regarding the mandates of the heroes and the leg[X]ty of the operations in new york and washington".

 ret[X]ation for the american war on [Y] which al-qaeda alleges has targeted "muslim women, children and elderly";

 the t[X]ban also garnered support from graduates of [Y]ic schools, which are called madrassa.

the continuing lawlessness enabled the growing and well-disciplined t[X]ban to expand their control over territory in afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 while not officially working together, al-qaeda enjoyed the t[X]ban's protection and supported the regime in such a strong symbiotic relationship that many western observers dubbed the t[X]ban's [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan as, "the world's first terrorist-sponsored state.

neither bin laden nor al-zawahiri possessed the traditional [Y]ic scholarly qu[X]fications to issue a fatwa.

in february 2014, after a prolonged dispute with al-qaeda in iraq's successor organisation, the [Y]ic state of iraq and the levant (isis), al-qaeda publicly announced it was cutting all ties with the group, reportedly for its brut[X]ty and "notorious intractability".

in september 2021, after the success of 2021 t[X]ban offensive, al-qaeda congratulated t[X]ban and called for liberation of kashmir from the “clutches of the enemies of [Y]".

 two fatwas are said to have been appointed by al-qaeda's members, mamdouh mahmud s[X]m, to justify the killings according to [Y]ic law.

by the end of 2004, the us government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the cia: abu zubaydah, ramzi bin al-shibh and abd al-rahim al-nashiri in 2002; kh[X]d sheikh mohammed in 2003; and saif al [Y] el masry in 2004.

in mid-2014 after the [Y]ic state of iraq and the levant declared that they had restored the c[X]phate, an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group abu muhammad al-adnani claiming that "the leg[X]ty of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the c[X]phate's authority.

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm in the united states

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm

 during the twentieth century, some african americans converted to [Y], mainly through the influence of black nation[X]st groups that preached with distinctive [Y]ic practices; including the moorish science temple of america, and the largest organization, the nation of [Y], founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963.

following the rise of the t[X]ban in 1996, massoud, who rejected the t[X]ban's fundament[X]st interpretation of [Y], returned to armed opposition until he was forced to flee to kulob, tajikistan, strategically destroying the salang tunnel on his way north.

 while studying at the lycée massoud took interest in all things military, namely during the six-day war in which he became enamoured by egyptian president gamel abdel nasser's [Y]ic nation[X]sm and defiance.

 the director of the centre for arab and [Y]ic studies at the austr[X]an national university, amin saikal, writes in modern afghanistan: a history of struggle and survival that without pakistan's support, hekmatyar "would not have been able to target and destroy half of kabul.

 on the one side was the shia hazara hezb-i wahdat of abdul [X] mazari and on the other side, the sunni pashtun ittihad-i [Y]i of abdul rasul sayyaf.

 the ghaz[X] foundation enabled afghan artists to exhibit their works at different places in kabul, and numerous artists and authors were honoured for their works; some of them neither proponents of massoud nor the [Y]ic state government.

 in 1994, the t[X]ban (a movement originating from jamiat ulema-e-[Y]-run religious schools for afghan refugees in pakistan) also developed in afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.

hizb-i [Y]i had bombarded kabul from january 1994 until february 1995 when the t[X]ban expelled hizb from its charasiab headquarters, after which the t[X]ban relaunched the bombardment of kabul and started to besiege the town.

 the t[X]ban started shelling kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the [Y]ic state government under ahmad shah massoud.

 the t[X]ban's first major offensive against the important western city of herat, under the rule of [Y]ic state ally ismail khan, in february 1995 was defeated when massoud airlifted 2,000 of his own core forces from kabul to help defend herat.

 many pashtun areas under t[X]ban control had representatives also advocating for a peace agreement with the [Y]ic state government.

 the t[X]ban marched into kabul on september 27, 1996, and established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 he stated that the t[X]ban and al-qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of [Y]" and that without the support of pakistan and bin laden the t[X]ban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.

 antisemitism has increased greatly in the region since the beginning of the 20th century, for several reasons: the dissolution and breakdown of the ottoman empire and traditional [Y]ic society; european influence, brought about by western imperi[X]sm and arab christians; nazi propaganda and relations between nazi germany and the arab world; resentment over jewish nation[X]sm; the rise of arab nation[X]sm; and the widespread proliferation of anti-jewish and anti-zionist conspiracy theories.

by medieval standards, conditions for jews under [Y] were generally more form[X]zed and better than those of jews in christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with christians in these lands.

some scholars hold that arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting jewish and arab nation[X]sm, and was imported into the arab world primarily by nation[X]stically minded christian arabs (and only subsequently was it "[Y]ized"), mark cohen states.

george gruen attributes the increased animosity towards jews in the arab world to the defeat and breakdown of the ottoman empire and traditional [Y]ic society; domination by western colonial powers under which jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of arab nation[X]sm, whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local jews through government channels; resentment over jewish nation[X]sm and the zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular arab regimes to scapegoat local jews for political purposes.

 since the establishment of the state of israel, the druze have demonstrated solidarity with israel and distanced themselves from arab and [Y]ic radic[X]sm.

 as scholars learned esoteric sciences, they joined local non-[Y]ic aristocratic courts, who quickly [X]gned divination and amulets with the "proof of the power of [Y]ic religion.

 after the death of c[X]ph [X] in 661, mu'awiya was chosen as the c[X]ph of the expanding [Y]ic empire.

 with the ascension of c[X]ph abd al-m[X]k in 685, an [Y]ic coinage system was introduced and all of the surplus revenue of the c[X]phate's provinces were forwarded to the treasury of damascus.

 with the heralding of the abbasid c[X]phate, damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by baghdad, the new [Y]ic capital.

 in contrast, the shafi'i and hanb[X] madhabs only allow christians, jews and zoroastrians to have dhimmi status, while maintaining all other non-muslims must either convert to [Y] or be fought.

 [Y]ic legal systems based on sharia law incorporated the religious laws and courts of christians, jews, and hindus, as seen in the early c[X]phate, al-andalus, indian subcontinent, and the ottoman millet system.

" quoting the qur'anic statement, "let christians judge according to what we have revealed in the gospel", muhammad hamidullah writes that [Y] decentr[X]zed and "commun[X]zed" law and justice.

 [Y]ic law is therefore polynormative, and despite several cases of regression in recent years, the trend is towards liber[X]zation.

another egyptian [Y]ist, mohammad s[X]m al-awa argued the concept of dhimmi must be re-interpreted in the context of egyptian nation[X]sm.

 [X] khan also points to the constitution of medina as a way forward for [Y]ic states in his 2006 paper titled the medina constitution.

] muslims" and granted "the freedom of religion," can serve as a basis for the protection of minority rights, equ[X]ty, and religious freedom in the modern [Y]ic state.

 he posits universal rights of dignity, welfare, freedom, equ[X]ty and justice in a religiously and culturally plur[X]stic [Y]ic (or other) society, and proposes a dialogue regarding the modern term "citizenship," although it has no clear precedent in classical fiqh.

 marshall hodgson, a historian of [Y], writes that during the era of the high c[X]phate (7th–13th centuries), zealous shariah-minded muslims gladly elaborated their code of symbolic restrictions on the dhimmis.

because the early [Y]ic conquests initially preserved much of the existing administrative machinery and culture, in many territories they amounted to little more than a change of rulers for the subject populations, which "brought peace to peoples demor[X]zed and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of byzantine-persian warfare".

religious plur[X]sm existed in medieval [Y]ic law and ethics.

 the religious laws and courts of other religions, including christianity, judaism and hinduism, were usually accommodated within the [Y]ic legal framework, as exemplified in the c[X]phate, al-andalus, ottoman empire and indian subcontinent.

 however, western orient[X]sts doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no arabic and knew nothing of [Y] could draft such a document.

elsewhere during the middle ages, [Y]ic science and mathematics flourished under the [Y]ic c[X]phate which was established across the middle east, extending from the iberian peninsula in the west to the indus in the east and to the almoravid dynasty and m[X] empire in the south.

in december 2006, the endf entered som[X]a to confront the [Y]ic courts union, initially winning the battle of baidoa.

 one of the last detainees was the indonesian aceh separatist hasan di tiro who, while a student in new york in 1953, declared himself the "foreign minister" of the rebellious darul [Y] movement and was subsequently stripped of his indonesian citizenship and held as an "illegal [X]en".

activities performed by the group in the period between june 2004 and june 2008 include monitoring elections in palestine and the ukraine; encouraging transeuropean rail travel, telecoms deregulation, energy security, a common energy policy, the accession of bulgaria and romania to the union, partial reform of the cap and attempts to tackle illegal immigration; denouncing russian involvement in south ossetia; supporting the constitution treaty and the lisbon treaty; debating glob[X]sation, relations with china, and taiwan; backing plans to outlaw holocaust denial; nominating anna politkovskaya for the 2007 sakharov prize; expelling daniel hannan from the group; the discussion about whether ed meps should remain within epp-ed or form a group of their own; criticisms of the group's approach to tackling low turnout for the 2009 elections; the group's use of the two-president arrangement; and the group's proposal to ban the [Y]ic burka dress eu wide.

there is no concept of absolute evil in [Y], as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a du[X]stic sense.

 however, the group denied responsibility and [Y]ic fundament[X]sts from morocco were eventually convicted.

 sky blue: symbol of peace and neutr[X]ty, as other colours were already used for other movements such as black for mourning, red for bolshevism, or green for [Y].

 muhammad echoed these eg[X]tarian sentiments, sentiments that clashed with the practices of the pre-[Y]ic cultures.

 in a review of louise marlow's hierarchy and eg[X]tarianism in [Y]ic thought, ismail poonawala wrote: "with the establishment of the arab-muslim empire, however, this eg[X]tarian notion, as well as other ideals, such as social justice and social service, that is, alleviating suffering and helping the needy, which constituted an integral part of the [Y]ic teaching, slowly receded into the background.

according to bat ye'or, christians under [Y]ic rule were denied equ[X]ty of rights since they were forced to pay the jizya poll tax.

 to common pakistanis it was called “oriental pakistan” or alternatively [Y]ically as “bang[X]stan”.

-led co[X]tion airstrikes against [Y]ic state militants in iraq and syria.

 on 11 january 2013 france begun operation serval to fight [Y]ists in m[X] with african support but without nato involvement.

 françois hollande launched two military operations in africa: operation serval in m[X] (the french armed forces stopped an [Y]ist takeover of bamako, the nation's capital city); and operation sangaris (to restore peace there as tensions between different religious communities had turned into a violent conflict).

 nepalese muslims bears [Y]ic surnames such as [X], ansari, begum, khan, mohammad, pathan.

from 50 ah until the early second century ah there was competition between "a tradition[X]st approach to jurisprudence" in western arabia where [Y] was revealed and a "ration[X]st approach in iraq".

 but later as fate would have it (predestination in [Y]) when yazid i, an oppressive ruler took power, hussein ibn [X] the grandson of muhammad felt that it was a test from god for him and his duty to confront him.

  this is in part because of a "vacuum" in the other source of [Y]ic law, qada` (legal rulings by state appointed [Y]ic judges) after the fall of the last c[X]phate the ottoman empire.

starting on 16 october 2011 during operation linda nchi, kenyan air force f-5s supported the kenyan forces fighting in som[X]a against al shabab [Y]ists bombing targets inside som[X]a and spearheading the ground forces.

 other religions, such as umbanda, candomblé, other afro-brazilian religions, spiritu[X]sm, judaism, hinduism, buddhism, [Y], other eastern religions, esotericism and other christian churches like the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints had a smaller number of adherents.

 during sadat's presidency, his wife, jehan sadat, publicly advocated further women's rights, though egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equ[X]ty with the new [Y]ist movement and growing conservatism.

 however, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [Y]ic feminism, which argues for women's equ[X]ty within an [Y]ic framework.

[Y]ic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equ[X]ty, and social justice grounded within an [Y]ic framework.

 advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equ[X]ty in the quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of [Y]ic teaching through the quran, hadith (sayings of muhammad), and sharia (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.

in [Y], flatulence, if audible or odorous, inv[X]dates wudu (ritual purity).

a fatwā (, also ; ; plural fatāwā ) is a legal ruling on a point of [Y]ic law (sharia)  given by a qu[X]fied jurist in response to a question posed by a private individual, judge or government.

 while in most of the [Y]ic world judges were not required to consult muftis by any political authority, in muslim spain this practice was mandatory, so that a judicial decision was considered inv[X]d without prior approval by a legal speci[X]st.

early in the era of western coloni[X]sm, several fatwas were issued drawing on the classical legal distinction between lands under [Y]ic rule (dar al-[Y]) and lands of war (dar al-harb) or unbelief (dar al-kufr).

 khomeini himself did not call this proclamation a fatwa, and some scholars have argued that it did not qu[X]fy as one, since in [Y]ic legal theory only a court can decide whether an accused is guilty.

 in addition to denouncing its content, many [Y]ic jurists stressed that bin laden was not qu[X]fied to either issue a fatwa or declare a jihad.

 in other cases, [Y]ic jurists of different nation[X]ties, schools of law, and sometimes even denominations (sunni and shia), coordinate to issue a joint fatwa, which is expected to command greater authority with the public than individual fatwas.

 since women now represent a significant proportion of students studying [Y]ic law and qu[X]fying as muftiyas, their prominence in its interpretation is likely to rise.

 with the signing of the geneva accords, president najibullah unsuccessfully sought to end the democratic republic of afghanistan's isolation within the [Y]ic world and in the non-[X]gned movement.

the t[X]ban gradually gained control of the country in the summer of 2021 and proclaimed the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan on august 15, 2021.

 they rejected the existence of common[X]ties with theologically related religious traditions, such as the grouping of christianity, [Y], and judaism into one abrahamic family of religions.

fundament[X]sm within [Y] goes back to the early history of [Y] in the 7th century, to the time of the kharijites.

the shia and sunni religious conflicts since the 7th century created an opening for radical ideologues, such as [X] shariati (1933–77), to merge social revolution with [Y]ic fundament[X]sm, as exemplified by the iranian revolution in 1979.

 [Y]ic fundament[X]sm has appeared in many countries; the salafi-wahhabi version is promoted worldwide and financed by saudi arabia, qatar, and pakistan.

 the media, in an attempt to explain the ideology of ayatollah khomeini and the iranian revolution to a western audience described it as a "fundament[X]st version of [Y]" by way of analogy to the christian fundament[X]st movement in the u.

 thus was born the term [Y]ic fundament[X]st, which became a common use of the term in following years.

 for instance, the archbishop of wales has criticized "atheistic fundament[X]sm" broadly and said "any kind of fundament[X]sm, be it biblical, atheistic or [Y]ic, is dangerous".

 in the united states, private or cultural intolerance of women wearing the hijab ([Y]ic headcovering) and political activism by muslims also has been labeled "secular fundament[X]sm".

influential criticisms of fundament[X]sm include james barr's books on christian fundament[X]sm and bassam tibi's analysis of [Y]ic fundament[X]sm.

 [Y]ic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equ[X]ty, and social justice grounded in an [Y]ic framework.

 advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equ[X]ty in the quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of [Y]ic teaching through the qur'an (holy book), hadith (sayings of muhammad) and sharia (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.

 prior to the introduction of greek cosmology into the [Y]ic world, early muslims tended to also view the earth as flat, and muslim tradition[X]sts who rejected greek philosophy continued to hold to this view later on while various theologians held different opinions.

on 16 february 2015, egyptian f-16s struck weapons caches and training camps of the [Y]ic state (isis) in libya in ret[X]ation for the murder of 21 egyptian coptic christian construction workers by masked militants affiliated with isis.

 both fell under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority, but the strip has, since the battle of gaza in june 2007, been governed by hamas, a militant, palestinian, fundament[X]st [Y]ic organization, which came to power in the last-held elections in 2006.

  during the 7th century the territory was passed back and forth between the eastern roman (byzantine) empire and the persian (sasanian) empires before the rashidun c[X]phate was established during the great [Y]ic expansions of the 7th century.

 the second intifada also marked the beginning of rocket attacks and bombings of israeli border loc[X]ties by palestinian guerrillas from the gaza strip, especially by the hamas and palestinian [Y]ic jihad movements.

palestinian researcher khaled al-hroub has criticized what he called the "t[X]ban-like steps" hamas has taken: "the [Y]ization that has been forced upon the gaza strip—the suppression of social, cultural, and press freedoms that do not suit hamas's view[s]—is an egregious deed that must be opposed.

other factions include the army of [Y] (an [Y]ist faction of the doghmush clan), the nidal al-amoudi batt[X]on (an offshoot of the west bank-based fatah-linked al-aqsa martyrs' brigades), the abu [X] mustapha brigades (armed wing of the popular front for the liberation of palestine), the sheikh omar hadid brigade (isil offshoot), humat al-aqsa, jaysh al-ummah, katibat al-sheikh al-emireen, the mujahideen brigades, and the abdul al-qadir al-husseini brigades.

the vast majority of guinean muslims are adherent to sunni [Y], of the m[X]ki school of jurisprudence, influenced by sufism.

the sosso kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the void but the [Y]ic mandinka m[X] empire came to prominence when soundiata kéïta defeated the sosso ruler, sumanguru kanté at the semi-historical battle of kirina in c.

the it[X]an manuscript has 506 pages, of which the gospel of barnabas fills pages 43 to 500, written within red frames in an [Y]ic style.

 these beliefs—in particular, that jesus is a prophet of god and raised [X]ve without being crucified—conform to or resemble [Y]ic teachings which say that jesus is a major prophet who did not die on the cross but was taken [X]ve by angels to god.

 some 16th-century anti-trinitarian divines sought to reconcile christianity, [Y] and judaism; on the basis of very similar arguments to those presented in the gospel of barnabas, arguing that if salvation remains unresolved until the end times, then any one of the three religions could be a v[X]d path to heaven for their own believers.

after the muslim conquest of the levant in the 630s, the g[X]lee formed part of jund al-urdunn (the military district of jordan), itself part of bilad al-sham ([Y]ic syria).

 in 711, the [Y]ic umayyad c[X]phate invaded the iberian peninsula conquering the visigoth kingdom of hispania by 718, but soon g[X]cia was incorporated into the christian kingdom of asturias by 740.

[X] ibn abi t[X]b (4th c[X]ph in sunni [Y], and first imam in shia [Y]) says:

 the initial declaration was signed by 143 leaders from all of the world's major faiths, including baháʼí faith, brahmanism, brahma kumaris, buddhism, christianity, hinduism, indigenous, interfaith, [Y], jainism, judaism, native american, neo-pagan, sikhism, taoism, theosophist, unitarian univers[X]st and zoroastrian.

although their mort[X]ty ranks them lower than gods, it seems that the veneration of jinn had played more importance in the everyday life of pre-[Y]ic arabs than the gods themselves.

contemporary salafi tenets of [Y] reject modern interpretations of jinn, and adhere to liter[X]sm, arguing that the threat of jinn and their ability to possess humans can be proven by quran and sunnah.

 al-munajjid further asserts that reciting various quranic verses and adhkaar (devotional acts involving the repetition of short sentences glorifying god) "prescribed in sharia" [[Y]ic law] can protect against jinn, and that [Y]ic he[X]ng rituals common across [Y]ic culture used to prevent or expel jinn possession are actually shirk (polytheism).

jinn feature in the magical re[X]sm genre, introduced into turkish literature by tekin (1983), who uses magical elements known from pre-[Y]ic and [Y]ic anatolian lore.

the jinn had an indirect impact on [Y]ic art through the creation of t[X]smans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included qur'anic verses.

for the duration of the 6th century, the eastern roman empire was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the persian sassanid empire (see roman–persian wars), followed by the onslaught of the arising [Y]ic c[X]phate (rashidun and umayyad).

from the 7th century byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of [Y] and the c[X]phates.

 this trend, which included the conquests by the invading muslim forces and by that the spread of [Y] as well continued under umar's successors and under the umayyad c[X]phate, which conquered the rest of mediterranean north africa and most of the iberian peninsula.

 the personal protection of most politicians, especially of the [Y] critic ayaan hirsi [X], was stepped up to unprecedented levels.

the almohads, who had taken control of the almoravids' maghribi and al-andalus territories by 1147, surpassed the almoravides in fundament[X]st [Y]ic outlook, and they treated the non-believer dhimmis harshly.

for about the next 10 years, the country saw a steady process of secular westernization through atatürk's reforms, which included the unification of education; the discontinuation of religious and other titles; the closure of [Y]ic courts and the replacement of [Y]ic canon law with a secular civil code modeled after switzerland's and a penal code modeled after the it[X]an penal code; recognition of the equ[X]ty between the sexes and the granting of full political rights to women on 5 december 1934; the language reform initiated by the newly founded turkish language association; replacement of the ottoman turkish alphabet with the new turkish alphabet derived from the latin alphabet; the dress law (the wearing of a fez, is outlawed); the law on family names; and many others.

 following the deportation and enslavement of the muslim moors from the emirate of sicily and other it[X]an territories, the [Y]ic iberia was gradually conquered by christian forces during the reconquista.

 for the time prior to the beginning of [Y]—in the 6th century ce—sources are superior as well, if still of mixed qu[X]ty.

 thus, the subsequent [Y]ic empires were known as "c[X]phates", and a series of four c[X]phs governed the early [Y]ic empire: abū bakr (632–634), ʿumar ibn al-khaṭṭāb (umar І, 634–644), ʿuthmān ibn ʿaffān (644–656), and ʿalī ibn abī Ṭālib (656–661).

 these leaders are known as the rāshidūn ("rightly-guided") c[X]phs in sunnī [Y].

alongside the growth of the umayyad c[X]phate, the major political development within early [Y] in this period was the sectarian split and political divide between kharijite, sunnī, and shīʿa muslims; this had its roots in a dispute over the succession for the role of c[X]ph.

 muhammad's closest companions (ṣaḥāba), the four "rightly-guided" c[X]phs who succeeded him, continued to expand the [Y]ic empire to encompass jerusalem, ctesiphon, and damascus, and sending arab muslim armies as far as the sindh region.

 these imams were recognized by shia [Y] taking imam [X] as first c[X]ph/ imam and the same is institution[X]zed by the safavids and many similar institutions named now as ismaili, twelver etc.

 al-w[X]d i began the next stage of [Y]ic conquests.

[Y]ic world during the abbasid c[X]phate 

 the [Y]ic kingdoms associated with m[X] reached prominence in the 13th century.

 [Y] recognized to a certain extent the v[X]dity of the abrahamic religions, the quran identifying jews, christians, zoroastrians, and sabians (commonly identified with the mandaeans) as "people of the book".

politically, the abbasid c[X]phate evolved into an [Y]ic monarchy (unitary system of government.

 al-mahdi proclaimed that the c[X]ph was the protector of [Y] against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy.

 the kingdom of jerusalem and other smaller crusader kingdoms over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated politics of the levant, but did not threaten the [Y]ic c[X]phate nor other powers in the region.

 however, the crusaders did manage to damage [Y]ic c[X]phates; according to william of malmesbury, preventing them from further expansion into christendom and being targets of the mamluks and the mongols.

 the ilkhans of chingisid descendence claimed to be defenders of [Y], perhaps even the heirs of the abbasid c[X]phate.

early [Y]ic disciples fled to the port city of zeila in modern-day northern som[X]a to seek protection from the quraysh at the court of the aksumite emperor in present-day som[X]a.

 the victory of the muslims over the quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in arabia had by then all adopted [Y], and the major trading routes in the mediterranean and the red sea came under the sway of the muslim c[X]phs.

 native legends say that a group of sahaba, under m[X]k ibn deenar, arrived on the malabar coast and preached [Y].

during the early period of [Y], c[X]phs were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of the prophet mohammed.

in the [Y]ic republic of iran, the supreme leader, at present [X] khamenei serves as head of state.

in addition, in antiquity and the middle ages, hinduism was the state religion in many indianized kingdoms of asia, the greater indiafrom afghanistan (kabul) in the west and including almost all of southeast asia in the east (cambodia, vietnam, indonesia, partly philippines)and only by 15th century was nearly everywhere supplanted by buddhism and [Y], except several still hindu minor austronesian ethnic groups, such as the b[X]nese and tenggerese people in indonesia, and the chams in vietnam.

 in a series of rapid muslim conquests, the arab armies, motivated by [Y] and led by the c[X]phs and skilled military commanders such as kh[X]d ibn al-w[X]d, swept through most of the middle east; reducing byzantine lands by more than half and completely engulfing the persian lands.

 the [Y]ic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to europe was soon in the hands of it[X]an traders, especially the genoese and the venetians, who profited immensely from it.

muslim rulers nominated by the [Y]ic c[X]phate remained in control of egypt for the next six centuries, with cairo as the seat of the c[X]phate under the fatimids.

 it included two flags: the flag of the ottoman dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the [Y]ic c[X]ph, which had three crescents on a green base.

 in the course of the poem, "he considers every form of sexual orientation – celibacy, homosexu[X]ty, hedonism, and heterosexu[X]ty – raising the same kinds of questions as when he considers [Y] or democracy".

 in [Y]ic literature, 'abd al-m[X]k isami's persian work, futuhu's-salatin, composed in the deccan in 1350, uses the word '  to mean indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word '  to mean 'hindu' in the sense of a follower of the hindu religion".

 in the 11th-century text of al biruni, hindus are referred to as "religious antagonists" to [Y], as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between hindus holding a centr[X]st and plur[X]st religious views.

beyond the stipulations of british law, colonial orient[X]sts and particularly the influential asiatick researches founded in the 18th century, later called the asiatic society, initially identified just two religions in india – [Y], and hinduism.

 there were occasional exceptions such as akbar who stopped the persecution of hindus, and occasional severe persecution such as under aurangzeb, who destroyed temples, forcibly converted non-muslims to [Y] and banned the celebration of hindu festivals such as holi and diw[X].

christophe jaffrelot states that modern hindu nation[X]sm was born in maharashtra, in the 1920s, as a reaction to the [Y]ic khilafat movement wherein indian muslims championed and took the cause of the turkish ottoman sultan as the c[X]ph of all muslims, at the end of the world war i.

 hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of indian muslim population, of pan-[Y]ic hegemony, and questioned whether indian muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial indian nation[X]sm.

chris bayly traces the roots of hindu nation[X]sm to the hindu identity and political independence achieved by the maratha confederacy, that overthrew the [Y]ic mughal empire in large parts of india, allowing hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored hindu holy places such as varanasi.

 jaffrelot states that the efforts of christian missionaries and [Y]ic proselytizers, during the british colonial era, each of whom tried to gain new converts to their own religion, by stereotyping and stigmatising hindus to an identity of being inferior and superstitious, contributed to hindus re-asserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining [Y] and christianity, forming organisations such as the hindu sabhas (hindu associations), and ultimately a hindu-identity driven nation[X]sm in the 1920s.

 in the 20th century, the sense of religious nation[X]sm grew in india, states van der veer, but only muslim nation[X]sm succeeded with the formation of the west and east pakistan (later split into pakistan and bangladesh), as "an [Y]ic state" upon independence.

the hindu nation[X]sm movement has sought to reform indian laws, that critics say attempts to impose hindu values on india's [Y]ic minority.

 in contrast, opponents of hindu nation[X]sts remark that eliminating religious law from india poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of muslims, and people of [Y]ic faith have a constitutional right to [Y]ic shariah-based personal laws.

 brown, early schools of [Y]ic jurisprudence  used rulings of the prophet's companions, the rulings of the c[X]phs, and practices that “had gained general acceptance among the jurists of that school”.

 by the start of the 16th century, with the malacca sultanate in the malay peninsula and parts of sumatra, the demak sultanate in java, and other kingdoms around the malay archipelago increasingly converting to [Y], it had become the dominant religion among malays, and reached as far as the modern-day philippines, leaving b[X] as an isolated outpost of hinduism today.

 a small class of malay nation[X]st intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of [Y] in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly christianity.

 at the same time, an [Y]ist party, the [Y]ic party of malaysia (pas) and a democratic soci[X]st party, the democratic action party (dap), gained increasing support, at the expense of umno and the mca respectively.

 sadat was assassinated in 1981 by [Y]ic fundament[X]st members of the egyptian army who opposed peace with israel.

 the palestinian armed factions in the gaza strip, led by the [Y]ic jihad and the popular resistance committees, fired a massive amount of rockets towards southern israel in ret[X]ation, sparking five days of clashes along the gaza border.

the history of libya comprises six distinct perspectives: ancient libya, the roman era, the [Y]ic era, ottoman rule, it[X]an rule, and the modern era.

 during the following centuries libya came under the rule of several [Y]ic dynasties, under various levels of autonomy from ummayad, abbasid and fatimid c[X]phates of the time.

 though not creating a secular state – article 5 proclaims [Y] the religion of the state – the libyan constitution did formally set out rights such as equ[X]ty before the law as well as equal civil and political rights, equal opportunities, and an equal responsibility for public duties and obligations, "without distinction of religion, belief, race, language, wealth, kinship or political or social opinions" (article 11).

 in the early hours of 21 february 2011, saif al-[Y] gaddafi, oldest son of muammar gaddafi, spoke on libyan television of his fears that the country would fragment and be replaced by "15 [Y]ic fundament[X]st emirates" if the uprising engulfed the entire state.

 the main forces involved during that period in kabul, northern, central and eastern afghanistan were the hezb-i [Y]i of gulbuddin hekmatyar directed by pakistan, the hezb-i wahdat of abdul [X] mazari directed by iran, the ittehad-i [Y]i of abdul rasul sayyaf supported by saudi arabia, the junbish-i milli of abdul rashid dostum backed by uzbekisten, the harakat-i [Y]i of hussain anwari and the shura-i nazar operating as the regular [Y]ic state forces (as agreed upon in the peshawar accords) under the defence ministry of ahmad shah massoud.

 in 1994, the t[X]ban (a movement originating from jamiat ulema-e-[Y]-run religious schools for afghan refugees in pakistan) also developed in afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.

in 1995 the hezb-i [Y]i of gulbuddin hekmatyar, the iranian-backed hezb-i wahdat as well as rashid dostum's junbish forces were defeated militarily in the capital kabul by forces of the interim government under massoud who subsequently tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the t[X]ban to join the process.

the t[X]ban started shelling kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the [Y]ic state government under ahmad shah massoud.

 the t[X]ban seized kabul on september 27, 1996, and established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 he stated that the t[X]ban and al qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of [Y]" and that without the support of pakistan the t[X]ban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.

 the t[X]ban declined to participate, saying "the [Y]ic emirate has a clear position.

 despite the t[X]ban taking kabul, the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan still exists as a rump state.

 its members included several [Y]ic organisations in india, as well as 1400 nation[X]st muslim delegates.

hamas (, ; , ; an acronym of  , "[Y]ic resistance movement") is a palestinian sunni-[Y]ic fundament[X]st, militant, and nation[X]st organization.

 the muslim brotherhood arose as an attempt to have [Y]ic values extend beyond the mosque into the secular sphere, where it challenged the core assumptions, social, political, ideological, nation[X]st and economic of the existing ruling order.

creating hamas as an entity distinct from the muslim brotherhood was a matter of practic[X]ty; the muslim brotherhood refused to engage in violence against israel, but without participating in the intifada, the [Y]ists tied to it feared they would lose support to their rivals the palestinian [Y]ic jihad and the plo.

on june 25, two israeli soldiers were killed and another, gilad sh[X]t, captured following an incursion by the izz ad-din al-qassam brigades, popular resistance committees and army of [Y].

 it declares all of palestine a waqf, an un[X]enable religious property consisting of land endowed to muslims in perpetuity by god,  with religious coexistence under [Y]'s rule.

in 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in qalqiliya were suddenly banned by the hamas led municip[X]ty, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by [Y], or "haram".

 khaled al-hroub of the west bank-based and anti-hamas palestinian daily al ayyam added that despite claims by hamas leaders that it wants to repeat the turkish model of [Y], "what is happening on the ground in re[X]ty is a replica of the t[X]ban model of [Y].

 they were behind world war i, when they were able to destroy the [Y]ic c[X]phate, making financial gains and controlling resources.

 egyptian authorities stated that the 2011 alexandria bombing was carried out by the gaza-based army of [Y], which has received sanctuary from hamas and earlier collaborated in the capture of gilad sh[X]t.

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm

 the organization was established as part of an iranian effort, through funding and the dispatch of a core group of [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps (pasdaran) instructors, to aggregate a variety of lebanese shia groups into a unified organization to resist the israeli occupation and improve the standing and status of the long margin[X]sed and underrepresented shia community in that country.

during the lebanese civil war, hezbollah's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of "the americans, the french and their allies definitely from lebanon, putting an end to any coloni[X]st entity on our land", the submission of the christian phalangists to "just power", bringing them to justice "for the crimes they have perpetrated against muslims and christians", and permitting "all the sons of our people" to choose the form of government they want, while calling on them to "pick the option of [Y]ic government".

the ideology of hezbollah has been summarized as shi'i radic[X]sm; hezbollah follows the [Y]ic shi'a theology developed by iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini.

in 2010, iran's parliamentary speaker [X] larijani said, "iran takes pride in lebanon's [Y]ic resistance movement for its steadfast [Y]ic stance.

materials aimed at instilling principles of nation[X]sm and [Y] in children are an aspect of hezbollah's media operations.

[X] kourani, the first hezbollah operative to be convicted and sentenced in the united states, was under investigation since 2013 and worked to provide targeting and terrorist recruiting information to hezbollah's [Y]ic jihad organization.

" tuení believed that hezbollah's evolution is cosmetic, conce[X]ng a sinister long-term strategy to [Y]icize lebanon and lead it into a ruinous war with israel.

academics speci[X]zing in a wide variety of the social sciences believe that hezbollah is an example of an [Y]ic terrorist organization.

hyenas are used for food and medicinal purposes in som[X]a although they are considered haraam in [Y].

in the court of al-ma'mun, imam [X] al-ridha, a descendant of the prophet muhammad and chief [Y]ic scholar in the time of the abbasid c[X]phs, was asked by the exilarch to prove that muhammad was a prophet through the torah.

the famous and revered persian [Y]ic scholar and polymath ibn qutaybah, who served as a judge during the abbasid c[X]phate, said of the prophet habakkuk: "among the words of habakkuk, who prophesied in the days of daniel, habakkuk says: 'god came from teman, and the holy one from the mountains of paran and the earth was filled with the sanctification of the praiseworthy one (aḥmad, which is a name of muhammad in [Y]), and with his right hand he exercised power over the earth and the necks of the nations,'" which has been interpreted by scholars to be a clear allusion to habakkuk 3:3-4.

the shah urged that humayun convert from sunni to shia [Y] in order to keep himself and several hundred followers [X]ve.

 during emperor shah jahan and his son aurangzeb's [Y]ic sharia reigns, the empire reached its architectural and economic zenith, and became the world's largest economy, worth over 25% of world gdp and signaled the proto-industri[X]zation.

the birth of [Y] opposite som[X]a's red sea coast meant that som[X] merchants and sailors living on the arabian peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted arab muslim trading partners.

 with the migration of muslim families from the [Y]ic world to som[X]a in the early centuries of [Y], and the peaceful conversion of the som[X] population by som[X] muslim scholars in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into [Y]ic mogadishu, berbera, zeila, barawa and merka, which were part of the berber (the medieval arab term for the ancestors of the modern som[X]s) civilization.

 the berber people, being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to arab exclusivity in orthodox [Y], adopted shi'ite and kharijite [Y], both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the abbasid c[X]phate.

 he invited scholars and architects like ishal al-tuedjin (al-sahili) to further integrate m[X] into the [Y]ic world.

 [Y] was used to extend his authority by declaring jihad on the mossi, reviving the trans-saharan trade, and having the abbasid "shadow" c[X]ph in cairo declare him as c[X]ph of sudan.

 in 1981, sadat was assassinated by members of the egyptian [Y]ic jihad under kh[X]d [Y]bouli.

 north africa serves as a raci[X]zed region of “european africa”, which is conceptually disconnected from sub-saharan africa, and conceptually connected to the middle east, asia, and the [Y]ic world.

as opposed to having been developed through field research, the analogy in the present-day european africanist paradigm, which conceptually [X]enates, dehistoricizes, and denatur[X]zes darker skinned north africans in north africa and darker skinned africans throughout the [Y]ic world at-large, is primarily rooted in an americanized textual tradition inherited from 19th century european christian abolitionists.

 under boumédiène's rule, leftist and soci[X]st concepts were merged with [Y].

  on one hand, he made token concessions and cosmetic changes to the government to appear more [Y]ic, such as putting [Y]ist ahmed taleb ibrahimi in charge of national education in 1965 and adopting policies crimin[X]zing gambling, establishing friday as the national holiday, and dropping plans to introduce birth control to paint an [Y]ic image of the new government.

 the ottoman government followed [Y]ic law when de[X]ng with the conquered christian population.

 the division was between the tanzeem nasle nau hazara, a party based in quetta, of hazara nation[X]sts and secular intellectuals, and the [Y]ist parties in hazarajat.

as the soviets withdrew in 1989, the [Y]ist groups felt the need to broaden their political appeal and turned their focus to hazara ethnic nation[X]sm.

 hazara famous football players are zohib [Y] amiri, who is currently playing for the afghanistan national football team, moshtagh yaghoubi an afghan-finnish footballer who plays for hifk, mustafa amini an afghan-austr[X]an footballer who plays as a midfielder for danish superliga club agf and the austr[X]an national team, rahmat akbari an afghan-austr[X]an footballer who plays as a midfielder for brisbane roar, and others like [X] hazara and zahra mahmoodi.

 this was influenced by the direction, energy, and resources that the early umayyad c[X]phs directed after the death of prophet muhammad (632 ce) towards spreading [Y] to the nations that they invaded and the expansion of their c[X]phate.

 however, this rising interest in [Y]ic medicine grew significantly when the abbasid c[X]phate (750-1258 ce) overthrew the umayyad c[X]phate in 750 ce.

 additionally, during this time the creation of the first [Y]ic hospital in 805 ce by the abbasid c[X]ph harun al-rashid in baghdad was recounted as a glorious event of the golden age.

 taking leads from greece and rome, [Y]ic scholars kept both the art and science of medicine [X]ve and moving forward.

 institution[X]zation of medicine was another important achievement in the [Y]ic world.

 although hospitals as an institution for the sick emerged in the byzantium empire, the model of institution[X]zed medicine for all social classes was extensive in the [Y]ic empire and was scattered throughout.

in the south, sicily had become an [Y]ic emirate in the 9th century, thriving until the italo-normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the lombard and byzantine princip[X]ties of southern italy.

 donations are allowed to christian, jewish, buddhist and hindu communities; however, [Y] remains excluded, since no muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the it[X]an state.

 the country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the united nations, world trade organization, g20, and a founding member of the non-[X]gned movement, association of southeast asian nations, east asia summit, and the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation.

indonesia has been a member of the united nations since 1950 and was a founding member of the non-[X]gned movement (nam) and the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation (oic).

 trade, [Y]ic missionary activity such as by the w[X] sanga and chinese explorer zheng he, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of [Y].

 while india was the only south asian country to recognise the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan in the 1980s, its relations were diminished during the afghan civil wars and the rule of the [Y]ist t[X]ban in the 1990s.

 on 10 september 1912, the first nation[X]st mass movement was formed: sarekat [Y].

as a multi-ethnic and multicultural democratic country with a muslim-majority population, indonesia faces the challenge of de[X]ng with terrorism linked to global militant [Y]ic movements.

 one cultural pattern consists of the formerly indianized, rice-growing peasants in the valleys and plains of sumatra, java, and b[X], another cultural complex is composed of the largely [Y]ic coastal commercial sector, a third, more marginal sector consists of the upland forest farming communities which exist by means of subsistence swidden agriculture.

 since 2001, the government of indonesia has co-operated with the us in cracking down on [Y]ic fundament[X]sm and terrorist groups.

the government of iran is an [Y]ic theocracy which includes elements of a presidential democracy, with the ultimate authority vested in an autocratic "supreme leader", a position held by [X] khamenei since khomeini's death in 1989.

 although both nation[X]sts and marxists had initially joined with [Y]ists to overthrow the shah, tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards.

 three days after, iran's [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps launched a ret[X]atory attack on us forces in iraq and by accident shot down ukraine international airlines flight 752, killing 176 civilians and leading to nation-wide protests.

 chapter ix of the constitution of the [Y]ic republic of iran sets forth the qu[X]fications for presidential candidates.

the [Y]ic republic of iran has two types of armed forces: the regular forces of the army, the air force, and the navy, and the revolutionary guards, tot[X]ng about 545,000 active troops.

legal public holidays based on the iranian solar calendar include the cultural celebrations of nowruz (farvardin 1–4; 21–24 march) and sizdebedar (farvardin 13; 2april), and the political events of [Y]ic republic day (farvardin 12; 1april), the death of ruhollah khomeini (khordad 14; 4june), the khordad 15 event (khordad 15; 5june), the anniversary of the 1979 revolution (bahman 22; 10 february), and oil nation[X]zation day (esfand 29; 19 march).

lunar [Y]ic public holidays include tasua (muharram 9; 30 september), ashura (muharram 10; 1october), arba'een (safar 20; 10 november), the death of muhammad (safar 28; 17 november), the death of [X] al-ridha (safar 29 or 30; 18 november), the birthday of muhammad (rabi-al-awwal 17; 6december), the death of fatimah (jumada-al-thani 3; 2march), the birthday of [X] (rajab 13; 10 april), muhammad's first revelation (rajab 27; 24 april), the birthday of muhammad al-mahdi (sha'ban 15; 12 may), the death of [X] (ramadan 21; 16 june), eid al-fitr (shawwal 1–2; 26–27 june), the death of ja'far al-sadiq (shawwal 25; 20 july), eid al-qurban (zulhijja 10; 1september), and eid al-qadir (zulhijja 18; 9september).

 the sassanid empire was eventually conquered by the rashidun c[X]phate in the 7th century, with iraq specifically falling under [Y]ic rule following the battle of al-qadisiyyah in 636.

 baghdad would remain the capital of the abbasid c[X]phate for the majority of its existence, during which time it became the cultural and intellectual center of the world in what is known today as the [Y]ic golden age.

in spite of having lost all governance, the abbasid c[X]phs nevertheless maintained a highly ritu[X]zed court in baghdad and remained influential in religious matters, maintaining the orthodoxy of their sunni sect in opposition to the ismaili and shia  sects of [Y].

 this demand of behramani caused much dismay on the american side as it made clear to them that they would not be de[X]ng solely with a "moderate" faction in the [Y]ic republic, as the americans liked to pretend to themselves, but rather with all the factions in the iranian government – including those who were very much involved in terrorism.

kh[X]d chraibi, the reform of the [Y]ic calendar: the terms of the debate, tabsir.

 following the abbasid takeover from the umayyads and the shift of the economic centre of the [Y]ic c[X]phate from damascus to baghdad, the western province of al-andalus was margin[X]sed and ultimately became politically autonomous as independent emirate in 756, ruled by one of the last surviving umayyad royals, abd al-rahman i.

tensions between iraq and iran were fuelled by iran's [Y]ic revolution and its appearance of being a pan-[Y]ic force, in contrast to iraq's arab nation[X]sm.

 iran's new [Y]ic administration was regarded in baghdad as an irrational, existential threat to the ba'ath government, especially because the ba'ath party, having a secular nature, discriminated against and posed a threat to the fundament[X]st shia movement in iraq, whose clerics were iran's allies within iraq and whom khomeini saw as oppressed.

 on 28 june 1981, they assassinated the secretary-general of the [Y]ic republican party, mohammad beheshti and on 30 august, killed iran's president, mohammad-[X] rajai.

 the [Y]ic revolution of iran was strengthened and radic[X]sed.

economic historians and authors such as mendels, pomeranz and kridte argue that proto-industri[X]zation in parts of europe, [Y]ic world, mughal india, and china created the social and economic conditions that led to the industrial revolution, thus causing the great divergence.

[Y]ism (also often called political [Y] or [Y]ic fundament[X]sm) is a political ideology which posits that modern states and regions should be reconstituted in constitutional, economic and judicial terms, in accordance with what is conceived as a revival or a return to authentic [Y]ic practice in its tot[X]ty.

 [Y]ists may emphasize the implementation of sharia, pan-[Y]ic political unity, the creation of [Y]ic states, or the outright removal of non-muslim influences; particularly of western or universal economic, military, political, social, or cultural nature in the muslim world; that they believe to be incompatible with [Y] and a form of western neocoloni[X]sm.

 by the turn of the twentieth century the shorter and purely arabic term "[Y]" had begun to  displace it, and by 1938, when orient[X]st scholars completed the encyclopaedia of [Y], [Y]ism seems to have virtually disappeared from english usage.

 from french, it began to migrate to the english language in the mid-1980s, and in recent years has largely displaced the term [Y]ic fundament[X]sm in academic circles.

the new use of the term "[Y]ism" at first functioned as "a marker for scholars more likely to sympathize" with new [Y]ic movements; however, as the term gained popularity it became more specifically associated with political groups such as the t[X]ban or the algerian armed [Y]ic group, as well as with highly publicized acts of violence.

 to all intents and purposes, [Y]ic fundament[X]sm and [Y]ism have become synonyms in contemporary american usage.

] the whole body of thought which seeks to invest society with [Y] which may be integrationist, but may also be tradition[X]st, reform-minded or even revolutionary"

 jihadist organizations like al-qaeda and the egyptian [Y]ic jihad, and groups such as the t[X]ban, entirely reject democracy, often declaring as kuffar those muslims who support it (see takfirism), as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis.

 fuller has described as the fundament[X]st "guardians of the tradition" (salafis, such as those in the wahhabi movement) and the "vanguard of change and [Y]ic reform" centered around the muslim brotherhood.

a writer for the international crisis group maintains that "the conception of 'political [Y]'" is a creation of americans to explain the iranian [Y]ic revolution and apolitical [Y] was a historical fluke of the "short-lived era of the heyday of secular arab nation[X]sm between 1945 and 1970", and it is quietist/non-political [Y], not [Y]ism, that requires explanation.

 olivier roy believes "the socioeconomic re[X]ties that sustained the [Y]ist wave are still here and are not going to change: poverty, uprootedness, crises in values and identities, the decay of the educational systems, the north-south opposition, and the problem of immigrant integration into the host societies".

 critics of the concept hold that [Y]ist aspirations are fundamentally incompatible with the democratic principles, thus even moderate [Y]ists are tot[X]tarian in nature.

" this state originally pertained only to iran, where "post-[Y]ism is expressed in the idea of fusion between [Y] (as a person[X]zed faith) and individual freedom and choice; and post-[Y]ism is associated with the values of democracy and aspects of modernity".

 there, muslim brothers' [Y]ism had synthesized with salafism, and led to the creation of the salafi activist trend exemplified by the sahwa movement in the 80s, promulgated by safar al-haw[X] and salman al-ouda.

 wahhabism is also characterized by its disinterest in social justice, anticoloni[X]sm, or economic equ[X]ty, expounded upon by the mainstream [Y]ists.

 under this condition, qutb had cultivated his [Y]ist ideology in his seminal work ma'[X]m fi-l-tariq (milestones), in which he equated the muslims within the nasser regime with secularism and the west, and described them as regression back to jahiliyyah (period of time before the advent of [Y]).

salafi jihadism is a term coined by gilles kepel in 2002, referring to the ideology which actively promotes and conducts violence and terrorism in order to pursue the establishment of an [Y]ic state or a new c[X]phate.

some [Y]ic reviv[X]st movements and leaders pre-dating [Y]ism include:

 shah w[X]ullah was a forerunner of reformist [Y]ists like muhammad abduh, muhammad iqbal and muhammad asad in his belief that there was "a constant need for new ijtihad as the muslim community progressed and expanded and new generations had to cope with new problems" and his interest in the social and economic problems of the poor.

 sayyid ahmad barelvi was a disciple and successor of shah w[X]ullah's son who emphasized the 'purification' of [Y] from un-[Y]ic beliefs and practices.

  unlike some later [Y]ists, early salafiyya strongly emphasized the restoration of the c[X]phate.

the crises experienced across the muslim world after the collapse of ottoman c[X]phate would re-introduce the debates over the theory of an alternative [Y]ic state into the centre of muslim religious-political thinking of the early 20th-century.

 as the circumstances shifted through further western cultural and imperial inroads, militant [Y]ists and fundament[X]sts stepped up to assert [Y]ic values using rida's ideas as the chief vehicle, starting from 1950s.

in his influential book al-khilafa aw al-imama al-'uzma ("the c[X]phate or the grand imamate"); rashid rida elaborated on the establishment of his proposed “[Y]ic state”  which emphasised the implementation of sharia as well as the adoption of an [Y]ic consultation system (shura) that enshrined leading role of the ulema ([Y]ic scholars) in political life.

in rida's c[X]phate, the kh[X]fa was to be the supreme head whose role was to govern by supervising the application of [Y]ic laws.

 this khilafa shall also be able to revit[X]se the [Y]ic civilization, restore political and legal independence to the muslim umma (community of muslim believers), and cleanse [Y] from the heretical influences of sufism.

 rashid rida's [Y]ic political theory would greatly influence many subsequent [Y]ic reviv[X]st movements across the arab world.

 rida was certain that an [Y]ic society which implemented sharia in the proper manner would be able to successfully resist both capit[X]sm as well as the disorder of class-based soci[X]sm; since such a society would be unsusceptible to its temptations.

muhammad iqbal was a philosopher, poet and politician in british india who is widely regarded as having inspired the [Y]ic nation[X]sm and pakistan movement in british india.

iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nation[X]sm weaken the spiritual foundations of [Y] and muslim society, but that india's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage, culture and political influence.

 in his travels to egypt, afghanistan, palestine and syria, he promoted ideas of greater [Y]ic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nation[X]st differences.

 trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journ[X]sm, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about [Y] and [Y]ic law.

maududi's political ideas influenced sayyid qutb a leading member of the muslim brotherhood movement, and one of the key philosophers of [Y]ism and highly influential thinkers of [Y]ic univers[X]sm.

 sharia law was not only accessible to humans and essential to the existence of [Y], but also all-encompassing, precluding "evil and corrupt" non-[Y]ic ideologies like communism, nation[X]sm, or secular democracy.

 ba'athism, arab soci[X]sm, and arab nation[X]sm suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic [Y]ist movements inspired by maududi and sayyid qutb gained ground.

the views of [X] shariati, the ideologue of the iranian revolution, resembled those of mohammad iqbal, the ideological father of the state of pakistan, but khomeini's beliefs are perceived to be placed somewhere between the beliefs of shia [Y] and the beliefs of sunni [Y]ic thinkers like mawdudi and qutb.

 he believed that complete imitation of the prophet mohammad and his successors such as [X] for the restoration of sharia law was essential to [Y], that many secular, westernizing muslims were actually agents of the west and therefore serving western interests, and that acts such as the "plundering" of muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against [Y] by western governments.

 khomeini talked not about restoring the c[X]phate or sunni [Y]ic democracy, but about establishing a state where the guardianship of the democratic or the dictatorial political system was performed by shia jurists (ulama) as the successors of shia imams until the mahdi returns from occultation.

the revolution was influenced by marxism through [Y]ist thought and also by writings that sought either to counter marxism (muhammad baqir al-sadr's work) or to integrate soci[X]sm and [Y]ism  ([X] shariati's work).

the strength of the [Y]ist movement was manifest in an event which might have seemed sure to turn muslim public opinion against fundament[X]sm, but did just the opposite.

instead of prompting a backlash against the movement from which the attackers originated, however, saudi arabia, already very conservative, responded by shoring up its fundament[X]st credentials with even more [Y]ic restrictions.

in other muslim countries, blame for and wrath against the seizure was directed not against fundament[X]sts, but against [Y]ic fundament[X]sm's foremost geopolitical enemy—the united states.

another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radic[X]ze the [Y]ist movement was the gulf war, which brought several hundred thousand us and allied non-muslim military personnel to saudi arabian soil to put an end to saddam hussein's occupation of kuwait.

  [Y]ism had been an ide[X]zed/utopian  concept to compare with the grim re[X]ty of the status quo, but in more than four decades it had failed to establish a "concrete and viable blueprint for society" despite repeated efforts (olivier roy); and instead had left a less than inspiring track record of its impact on the world (nader hashemi).

 in 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic [Y]ist movement known as the t[X]ban rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of afghanistan.

 the t[X]ban differed from other [Y]ist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as [Y]ic fundament[X]st or neofundament[X]st, interested in spreading "an ide[X]zed and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs" under the label of sharia to an entire country.

 founded as a broad [Y]ist co[X]tion in 1989 it was led by abbassi madani, and a charismatic [Y]ist young preacher, [X] belhadj.

 since 2000, the main political opposition bangladesh nation[X]st party (bnp) has been allied with it and another [Y]ic party, [Y]i oikya jote.

 [X] bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with [Y]ists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown.

mirzā ghulām [X] (13 february 1835 – 26 may 1908) was an indian religious leader and the founder of the [X]iyya movement in [Y].

born in 1835 to a rais family in qadian, ghulam [X] emerged as a writer and debater for [Y].

 as opposed to the christian and mainstream [Y]ic view of jesus (or isa), being alive in heaven to return towards the end of time, ghulam [X] asserted that he had in fact survived crucifixion and died a natural death.

although ghulam [X] is revered by [X]i muslims as the promised messiah and imām mahdi, muhammad nevertheless remains the central figure in [X]iyya [Y].

 ghulam [X]'s claim to be a subordinate (ummati) prophet within [Y] has remained a central point of controversy between his followers and mainstream muslims, who believe muhammad to be the last prophet.

in 1886, certain leaders of the arya samaj held discussion and debate with ghulam [X] about the truthfulness of [Y] and asked for a sign to prove that [Y] was a living religion.

 in one of his most well-known and praised works, barahin-e-[X]iyya, a voluminous work, he claimed to be the messiah of [Y].

 mirza ghulam [X] wrote two books named "tuhfa e qaisariah" and "sitara e qaisaria" in which he invited queen victoria to embrace [Y] and forsake christianity.

upon this, there was a clamour among the crowds, and mirza ghulam [X] was informed that the other party alleged that he was at odds with [Y]ic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs.

 furthermore, some [Y]ic scholars have opined that jesus has died (ghulam [X]'s assertion) or have expressed their own confusion on this matter, though the majority orthodox position of most muslims with regard to this issue has not changed.

 the [X]iyya muslim community, which comprises by far the majority of [X]is, believes that ghulam [X]'s prophetic status does not in any way infringe the finality of muhammad's prophethood – to which it is wholly subservient and from which it is inseparable – and is in accordance with scriptural prophecies concerning the advent of the messiah in [Y].

the movement initiated by ghulam [X] – which is often seen to have emerged as an [Y]ic religious response to the christian and arya samaj missionary activity widespread in 19th century india, and is viewed by its adherents as embodying the promised latter day revival of [Y] – has, since its establishment, grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme under the leadership of its caliphate.

some [Y]ic traditions view the name [X] as another given name of muhammad at birth by his mother, considered by muslims to be the more esoteric name of muhammad and central to understanding his nature.

traditional [Y]ic sources, such as sahih al-bukhari, sahih muslim, and others contain hadith in which muhammad personally refers to himself as [X].

 [Y]ic scholars such as william montgomery watt, however, argue that the use of [X] as a proper name for muhammad did not exist until well into the second [Y]ic century, previously being used only in an adjectival sense.

after the first round of the election, some people, including mehdi karroubi, the pragmatic reformist candidate who ranked third in the first round but was the first when partial results were first published, have alleged that a network of mosques, the [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps military forces, and basij militia forces have been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for [X]inejad.

 this despite that region's large numbers of disgruntled sunni muslims, and [X]inejad's association with "intrusive shia [Y]ism.

also, some political groups, including the reformist party [Y]ic iran participation front, have alleged that [X]inejad had only ranked second because of the illegal support and advertising activities for him during the voting by the supervisors selected by the guardian council, while the supervisors should have remained impartisan according to the election law.

 also, the reformist newspaper shargh has pointed to an announcement by movahhedi kermani, the official representative of the supreme leader in [Y]ic revolutionary guards corps, mentioning "vote for a person who keeps to the minimum in his advertisements and doesn't lavish", which uniquely pointed to [X]inejad.

[X]iyya [Y] considers jesus (ʿĪsā) as a human mortal man and prophet of god, born to the virgin mary (maryam).

 in [X]iyya [Y], jesus is thought to have died a natural death in india.

although sharing many similarities with the other [Y]ic views of jesus, the [X]iyya teachings are distinct from the beliefs held by most mainstream muslims, who deny the crucifixion of jesus and believe that he ascended bodily to heaven, and will, according to [Y]ic literary sources, return before the end of time.

[X]i scholars regard the contemporary [Y]ic interpretations relating to the second coming of jesus (see [X]i prophetology) are inaccurate.

 walter, like later scholars, identified the [Y]ic version of the barlaam and josaphat story as the primary of [X]'s evidence despite the fact that the four chapters of his book are arranged around evidence from the gospels, the quran and hadith, medical literature and historical records – respectively.

to illustrate the death of jesus, [X]iyya scholars use references to various [Y]ic hadith.

the encyclopedia of [Y] states that the post-crucifixion journey of jesus towards the east and his natural death as an aspect of [X]i belief is one of three primary tenets that distinguish [X]i teachings from general [Y]ic ones, and that it has provoked a fatwa against the movement.

the [X]iyya understanding of the term khatam an-nabiyyin (seal of prophets) with reference to muhammad, establishes that a prophet cannot come after muhammad from outside the [Y]ic dispensation.

thus [X]is regard that, as ghulam [X] was only a follower and reviver of the original [Y]ic faith, his claim of being a subordinate prophet (in the likeness of jesus being a subordinate prophet) does not in any way violate the seal of prophets (muhammed).

 in particular, contemporary [Y]ic scholars view the [X]iyya belief as a contradiction with the verse in the quran, chapter 33 (the combined forces), verse 40:

in 1894, ghulam [X] had declared that the contemporary [Y]ists views of jihad of the sword and holy war was a fundamental misrepresentation of [Y], that was invented during the dark ages.

the [X]iyya movement believe that any military jihad in [Y] is permitted only and exclusively for the defence of religious freedom and in very strictly defined circumstances (not exclusive only to [Y]).

 [X]is believe that in the modern era, the "jihad of the pen" (peaceful intellectual reasoning) is the only potent way of espousing and spreading the [Y]ic teaching.

 as a result, they are not allowed to profess the [Y]ic creed publicly or to call their places of worship mosques, to worship in non-[X]i mosques or public prayer-rooms, to perform the muslim call to prayer, to use the traditional [Y]ic greeting in public, to publicly quote from the quran, to preach in public, to seek converts, or to produce, publish, and disseminate their religious materials.

the lahore [X]iyya movement for the propagation of [Y], () is a separatist group within the [X]iyya movement that formed in 1914 as a result of ideological and administrative differences following the demise of hakim nur-ud-din, the first caliph after mirza ghulam [X].

adopting a position more congruent with the mainstream of sunni [Y] regarding the issues of dispute, muhammad ali led the lahore [X]iyya movement as amīr (president) from 1914 until his death in 1951.

 notwithstanding, the group was subsumed within pakistan's anti-[X]i laws declaring [X]is to be non-muslims and prohibiting them from any public expression of the [Y]ic faith.

 muhammad ali held that the type of prophecy described by ghulam [X] in reference to himself did not make him a prophet in the technical sense of the word as used in [Y]ic terminology, amounted to nothing more than sainthood (walāya) and that [Y]ic mystics preceding ghulam [X] had similarly described experiences of prophecy within [Y] in the context of their relationship with muhammad.

in contrast, mahmud [X] posited that ghulam [X]'s messianic claim and role were qualitatively distinct to the claims of the saints preceding him in [Y] and that his prophetic status, though completely subservient to muhammad, being a mere reflection of his own prophethood and not legislating anything new, still made him technically a prophet irrespective of the type of prophethood or the adjectives added to qualify it.

 that which subsists outside of [Y] in contrast to that which does not entail exclusion from it, although mahmud [X] held that muslims who did not accept ghulam [X] technically fell into the category of disbelief, and that rejection of him ultimately amounted to rejection of muhammad, he utilised the broad connotations and usages of the arabic word kafir to stress that his use of the term in reference to such muslims did not carry its demotic meaning, but rather meant to signify doctrinal deviancy and to express that only [X]is were true muslims.

 he held, therefore, that non-[X]i muslims were to be classified as disbelievers albeit within the remit of [Y] and not in the sense that they had a religion other than [Y]; and, further, that the movement passed no judgement as to their fate in the hereafter and never proactively expressed this opinion of them.

 although he refused demands from outside the movement to accept that the term kafir did not apply to non-[X]i muslims, mahmud [X] did maintain that such muslims were not deemed to be outside the pale of [Y].

towards the end of 1905, mirza ghulam [X] published a short treatise anticipating his own death entitled al-wasiyyat (or the will) in which he established the sadr anjuman [X]iyya (central [X]iyya council), an executive body set up to administer the movement and to collect and distribute funds to support the propagation of [Y].

 [X]is claim the [X]iyya movement to embody the latter day revival of [Y] and the movement has also been seen to have emerged as an [Y]ic religious response to the christian and arya samaj missionary activity that was widespread in 19th century india.

 the movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to ghulam [X]'s claim to be a prophet within [Y].

 in 1984, ordinance xx was promulgated by the government of pakistan which prohibited [X]i muslims from any public expression of the [Y]ic faith, rendering the caliph unable to perform his duties as the leader of the community.

since the [X]iyya is widely viewed as a heterodox movement by the mainstream of sunni and shi'ite [Y], most muslims outside the movement do not recognise [X]i claims to a caliphate as valid.

 in terms of the political aspect of the caliphate as envisioned within the [X]iyya community, since god's sovereignty is seen as extending over the universe, the ideal polity within [Y] is one where the caliph is the spiritual head guiding, in accordance with [Y]ic principles, a federation or confederation of autonomous states (functioning under any political system or form of government) associated together for the maintenance of peace and cooperating in promoting human welfare throughout the world.

 however, the [X]iyya caliphate is seen as a continuation of the first [Y]ic caliphate of muhammad and the [X]iyya caliphs as successors to ghulam [X] as well as ultimately to muhammad.

according to non-muslim scholars, [Y] started during the lifetime of [X] in the 7th century ce, and so did architectural components such as the mosque.

 in this case, either the mosque of the companions in the eritrean city of massawa, or the quba mosque in the hejazi city of medina (the first structure built by [X] upon his emigration from mecca in 622 ce), would be the first mosque that was built in the history of [Y].

despite his at times vehement denunciations of other religious groups for their supposedly heretical beliefs, ibn abd al wahhab never called for their destruction or death … he assumed that these people would be punished in the afterlife …"according to vahid hussein ranjbar, "[X] ibn ʿabd al-wahhab saw it as his mission to restore a more purer and original form of the faith of [Y]".

the nation of [Y] (noi) is a religious and political organization founded in the united states by wallace fard [X] in 1930.

wallace fard [X] established the nation of [Y] in detroit.

 members seeking to retain elijah [X]'s teachings re-established the nation of [Y] under louis farrakhan's leadership in 1977.

 its members have been called "black muslims," and its second leader, elijah [X], stated that "[Y] is the natural religion of the black nation.

he increasingly aligned the group with sunni [Y], rejecting many of the nation's idiosyncratic teachings, including its claim that fard was god, that elijah [X] had been a prophet, the myth of yakub, and the claims about the mother plane.

 wallace [X] claimed that these changes were in accordance with his father's intentions; he claimed to be in contact with fard [X], and that the founder had established the noi's idiosyncratic beliefs as a means of gradually introducing [Y]ic teachings to african americans, with the ultimate intention of bringing them to mainstream sunni [Y].

the leading figure in rejecting wallace [X]'s reforms was louis farrakhan, who, with other disaffected members began to rebuild the nation of [Y] in 1977.

 under farrakhan, the noi adopted more elements of mainstream [Y]ic practice, although not to the extent of wallace [X].

 it holds that the [Y]ic prophet [X] designated ali ibn abi talib as his successor and the imam (spiritual and political leader) after him, most notably at the event of ghadir khumm, but was prevented from succeeding [X] as the leader of the muslims as a result of the choice made by some of [X]'s other companions at saqifah.

 in other words, twelver clerics provide guardianship of the [Y]ic jurisprudence, which was defined by [X] and his twelve successors.

 they believe god chose ali to be [X]'s successor, infallible, the first caliph (khalifah, head of state) of [Y].

 maclean, a link between sindh and shias or proto-shias can be traced to hakim ibn jabalah al-abdi, a companion of the [Y]ic prophet [X], who traveled across sind to makran in the year 649ad and presented a report on the area to the caliph.

this difference between following either the ahl al-bayt ([X]'s family and descendants) or caliph abu bakr has shaped shia and non-shia views on some of the quranic verses, the hadith (narrations from [X]) and other areas of [Y].

 the members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the muslims and the crusaders, but raynald ignored this and insulted the [Y]ic prophet, [X], before murdering and torturing a number of them.

 in the early 7th century, the [Y]ic prophet [X] united the population of arabia and created a single [Y]ic religious polity.

[X], the prophet of [Y], was born in mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, before migrating to medina in 622.

 the masjid al-haram (the grand mosque) in mecca is the location of the kaaba, [Y]'s holiest site, and the masjid al-nabawi (the prophet's mosque) in medina is the location of [X]'s tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, mecca and medina became pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of muslims from across the muslim world.

 the al ash-sheikh are the descendants of [X] ibn abd al-wahhab, the 18th century founder of the wahhabi form of sunni [Y] which is today dominant in saudi arabia.

 isma'īl then grew up at mecca (in today's saudi arabia) and from which his descendants are the adnanite arabs (from the [Y]ic patriarch and ancestor adnan) - who is then one of the ancestors directly linked to the [Y]ic prophet [X].

the season fourteen episodes "200" and "201" were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the [Y]ic prophet, [X].

 classical sufi texts, which stressed certain teachings and practices of the quran and the sunnah (exemplary teachings and practices of the [Y]ic prophet [X]), gave definitions of tasawwuf that described ethical and spiritual goals and functioned as teaching tools for their attainment.

 brown notes that during the lifetime of [X], some companions were more inclined than others to "intensive devotion, pious abstemiousness and pondering the divine mysteries" more than [Y] required, such as abu dharr al-ghifari.

 ) – congregations formed around a grand master  who will trace their teaching through a chain of successive teachers back to the [Y]ic prophet [X].

according to ibn arabi, [Y] is the best religion because of [X].

 in this view, [Y] is the best religion because [X] is [Y].

 one of the outstanding pieces in the brooklyn museum's [Y]ic gallery has been the museum's associate curator of [Y]ic art, is a large 19th- or early-20th-century portrayal of the battle of karbala painted by abbas al-musavi, which was a violent episode in the disagreement between the sunni and shia branches of [Y]; during this battle, husayn ibn ali, a pious grandson of the [Y]ic prophet [X], died and is considered a martyr in [Y].

 to accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in judaism the torah, in christianity there is christ, for buddhism, buddha, and in [Y], [X].

al-khatib al-baghdadi, an 11th-century [Y]ic scholar, referenced a statement by the companion of [X], jabir ibn abd-allah:

[Y]: the [Y]ic society of central new york mosque is located on comstock avenue and [X]'s study group on west kennedy street.

the hadith (sayings of the [Y]ic prophet [X]) and the bible indicated that jesus would return during the latter days.

 [Y]ic tradition commonly depicts that jesus, upon his second coming, would be an ummati (muslim) and a follower of [X] and that he would revive the truth of [Y] rather than fostering a new religion.

the publication of the satanic verses in september 1988 caused immediate controversy in the [Y]ic world because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depiction of [X].

in response to the protests, on 22 january 1989 rushdie published a column in the observer that called [X] "one of the great geniuses of world history," but noted that [Y]ic doctrine holds [X] to be human, and in no way perfect.

 other books written by him include a biography of the [Y]ic prophet [X] titled "first and the last", while his other books are focused more on the relation between [Y] and science like miraculous quran, life after death and doomsday, and kitab-e-zindagi (in urdu).

according to the traditional muslim view, the major precepts of sharia were passed down directly from the [Y]ic prophet [X] without "historical development," and the emergence of [Y]ic jurisprudence (fiqh) also goes back to the lifetime of [X].

 820 ce/204 ah), who formulated this idea (that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources) and other elements of classical legal theory in his work al-risala, but who was preceded by a body of [Y]ic law not based on primacy of [X]'s hadiths.

the most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the egyptian [Y]ic scholar [X] ʿabduh (1849–1905).

 the liberal [Y]ic view is influenced by [X] abduh's emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion.

in classical fiqh, blasphemy refers to any form of cursing, questioning or annoying god, [X] or anything considered sacred in [Y],r ibrahim (2013), crucified again, , pp.

] constitute[s] a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by [Y]", while [X] sayyid tantawy, grand imam of al-azhar and former grand mufti of egypt has stated that "attacking innocent people is not courageous; it is stupid and will be punished on the day of judgment".

rape is considered a serious crime in the sharia law since the [Y]ic prophet [X] ordered rapists to be punished by stoning.

in [Y], sunnah (, ) are the traditions and practices of the [Y]ic prophet, [X], that constitute a model for muslims to follow.

 according to classical [Y]ic theories, the sunnah are documented by hadith (the verbally transmitted record of the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions or disapprovals of [X]), and along with the quran (the book of [Y]), are the divine revelation (wahy) delivered through [X] that make up the primary sources of [Y]ic law and belief/theology.

 differing from sunni classical [Y]ic theories are those of shia muslims, who hold that the twelve imams interpret the sunnah, and sufi who hold that [X] transmitted the values of sunnah "through a series of sufi teachers.

 during the early [Y]ic period, the term referred to any good precedent set by people of the past, including both [X], and his companions.

the classical meaning that now prevails was introduced later in the late second century of [Y], when under the influence of the scholar al-shafi‘i, [X]'s example as recorded in hadith was given priority over all other precedents set by other authorities.

"the actions and sayings of the prophet [X]" (oxford [Y]ic studies online).

 the path, the methodology and the way of [X]; and to "adhering to [Y] in the manner prescribed, without adding to it or introducing innovations into the religion", which hadith does not; fuqaha' scholars use the word "sunnah" when explaining the ruling on doing a specific action as being mustahabb (liked or encouraged), which they do not with hadith).

 according to seyyed nasr, the hadith contains the words of [X], while the sunnah contains his words and actions along with pre-[Y]ic practices of which he approved.

 christians, jews and the arab descendants of ishmael, the arabized arabs or ishmaelites, when [X] reinstituted this practice as an integral part of [Y].

the tradition which not directly sourced from hadith or practice of [X] and instead traced to solely some sahabah were also acknowledged as one of the source of jurisprudence, as it was regarded by scholars of [Y] such as nawawi as "unrecorded hadith" which not explicitly attributed to [X] himself but clearly practiced by the first generation of [X]'s follower.

 brown), the classical [Y]ic definition of sunnah as the customs and practices of [X] (only) was not the original one.

in al-Ṭabarī's history of early [Y], the term "sunnah of the prophet" is not only used "surprisingly infrequently", but used to refer to "political oaths or slogans used by rebels", or "a general standard of justice and right conduct", and not "to specific precedents set by [X]", let alone hadith.

 schools of fiqh in the second century of [Y], limited sunnah to "traditions traced back to the prophet [X] himself" (sunna al-nabawiyyah).

[Y] jurists divide sunnah into that which has no legal consequences --al-sunna al-ʿādīyah -- (the "personal habits and preferences" of [X]); and that which is binding on muslims -- al-sunna al-hudā.

 to them [X]'s attitude, his piety, the quality of his character constitute the truer and deeper aspect of what it means by sunnah in [Y], rather than the external aspects alone.

the primary collections of sunnah of shia [Y] were written by three authors known as the 'three [X]s', and they are:

[X] ali jinnah claimed that the pakistan movement started when the first muslim put his foot on the soil of sindh, which he labelled the "gateway of [Y]" in india.

[Y] in sindh has a long history, starting with the capture of sindh by [X] bin qasim in 712 ce.

early [Y]ic historians like ibn ishaq and ibn hisham always included shem's name in the genealogy of [X].

 it was later popularized by pan-[Y]ic scholars such as [X] rashid rida in his treatise as-sunna wa-š-šiʿa au al-wahhābīya wa-r-rāfiḍa: Ḥaqāʾiq dīnīya taʾrīḫīya iǧtimaʿīya iṣlaḥīya ("the sunna and the shia, or wahhabism and rāfidism: religious history, sociological und reformoriented facts“) published in 1928-29 c.

one common mistake is to assume that sunni [Y] represents a normative [Y] that emerged during the period after [X]'s death, and that sufism and shi'ism developed out of sunni [Y].

sunnis believe the companions of [X] to be reliable transmitters of [Y], since god and [X] accepted their integrity.

 syrian-albanian athari theologian [X] nasir al-din al-albani rejected extremism in excluding ash'aris from sunni [Y].

the quran as it exists today in book form was compiled by [X]'s companions (sahabah) within a handful of months of his death, and is accepted by all sects of [Y].

 according to ibn 'umar, [X] said that [Y] is based on the following five principles:

the palace of the lions is one of the most famous palaces in [Y]ic architecture and exemplifies the apogee of nasrid architecture under the reign of [X] v.

 however, a few shiite [Y]ists supported taliban rule, such as ustad [X] akbari.

gold: faruqi "فاروقی" for the pagoda (umar al-faruq, the second caliph) – sadîqi "صدیقی" for the double-pagoda (abu bakr al-sadiq, the first caliph) – ahmadi "احمدی" for the four-pagoda ( "most praised ", one of the name of the [Y]ic prophet [X]).

 the latter is described in the ahadith and the kitab al miraj (translated into latin in 1264 or shortly before as liber scalae machometi, "the book of [X]'s ladder"), and has significant similarities to the paradiso, such as a sevenfold division of paradise, although this is not unique to the kitab al miraj or [Y]ic cosmology.

 after initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of [Y]ic scholars who feared pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, [X] secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in indonesia to adhere to pancasila as a fundamental principle.

having been appointed president, [X] still needed to share power with various elements including indonesian generals who considered [X] as mere primus inter pares, and [Y]ic and student groups who participated in the anti-communist purge.

 [X] had also attempted at consolidating pancasila as the only state ideology, which was also turned down by the fierce resistance of [Y]ic groups.

 another prominent member was amien rais who would later become a major opponent of the [X] regime and chief of muhammadiyah, reputedly the largest [Y]ic organization in the world.
