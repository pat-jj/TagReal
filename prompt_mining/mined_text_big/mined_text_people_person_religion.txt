its founder, hassan al-banna, was influenced by pan-[Y]ic scholars [X] abduh and rashid rida (who attacked the taqlid of the official `ulama, and he insisted that only the quran and the best-attested hadiths should be sources of the sharia), with the group structure and approach being influenced by sufism.

the muslim brothers consider their movement to be the practical extension of the pan-[Y]ist movement championed by sayyid jamal al-din afghani, [X] 'abduh, and sayyid rashid rida.

 this vision was based upon the [Y]ic state doctrines of [X] rashid rida.

in the 1960s, malcolm x began to grow disillusioned with the nation of [Y], as well as with its leader elijah [X].

in late 1948, malcolm wrote to elijah [X], the leader of the nation of [Y].

 [X] instructed his followers to leave their family names behind when they joined the nation of [Y] and use "x" instead.

malcolmx is widely regarded as the second most influential leader of the nation of [Y] after elijah [X].

when malcolmx left the nation of [Y], he tried to convince clay (who had just been renamed [X] ali by elijah [X]) to join him in converting to sunni [Y], but clay instead broke ties with him, later describing the break as one of his greatest regrets.

 [X]; the son told malcolm x about his skepticism toward his father's "unorthodox approach" to [Y].

 wallace [X] was excommunicated from the nation of [Y] several times, although he was eventually re-admitted.

during 1962 and 1963, events caused malcolmx to reassess his relationship with the nation of [Y], and particularly its leader, elijah [X].

 malcolmx was again blocked by elijah [X] when he spoke of the nation of [Y] starting to work with civil rights organizations, local black politicians, and religious groups.

in 2021, [X] abdul aziz and khalil [Y] (formerly norman 3x butler and thomas 15x johnson) were exonerated from their murder convictions, following a review that found the fbi and the new york police department withheld key evidence during the trial.

 malcolmx had confided to a reporter that ali exacerbated tensions between him and elijah [X] and that he considered ali his "archenemy" within the nation of [Y] leadership.

 mecca also is reputedly the birthplace of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

 according to [Y]ic tradition, this was the year of [X]'s birth.

[X] was born in mecca in 570, and thus [Y] has been inextricably linked with it ever since.

 it was in mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of hira on jabal al-nour, that, according to [Y]ic tradition, [X] began receiving divine revelations from god through the archangel jibreel in 610 ce.

 the pagan imagery was destroyed by [X]'s followers and the location [Y]ized and rededicated to the worship of allah alone.

situated atop jabal an-nur, this is the place where muslims believe [X] received the first revelation from allah through the archangel gabriel (jibril in [Y]ic tradition) at the age of 40.

 each religion sees its founder ([X] for [Y], and joseph smith for mormonism) as being a true prophet of god, called to re-establish the truths of these ancient theological belief systems that have been altered, corrupted, or lost.

 [Y] proclaims that its prophet [X] was the "seal of the prophets", and that no further prophets would come after him.

the nation of [Y] (noi) is a religious and political organization founded in the united states by wallace fard [X] in 1930.

wallace fard [X] established the nation of [Y] in detroit.

 following elijah [X]'s death in 1975, his son warith deen mohammed took over the organization, moving it towards sunni [Y] and renaming it the world community of [Y] in the west.

 members seeking to retain elijah [X]'s teachings re-established the nation of [Y] under louis farrakhan's leadership in 1977.

 although employing the same name, the nation of [Y] has represented two distinct organizations: the first was established by wallace fard [X] in the 1930s and lasted until 1975, and the second then created by louis farrakhan in the late 1970s.

 its members have been called "black muslims," and its second leader, elijah [X], stated that "[Y] is the natural religion of the black nation.

 unlike most forms of [Y], the noi does not teach that the 6th/7th century arabian religious leader [X] was the final nor the most important messenger of god, instead treating its first two leaders, fard [X] and elijah [X], as being more important.

 it has established [X] universities of [Y]; most of these are elementary schools, although a few also offer secondary education.

the nation of [Y] was founded by wallace fard [X], who appeared in detroit in july 1930, when he began preaching his ideas among the city's african americans.

 fard [X] claimed that he was an arab from mecca who had come to the united states on a mission to the african american people, whom he called the "nation of [Y]," to restore them to their original faith.

 on joining the nation of [Y], fard [X] gave poole the new name of elijah karriem.

 increasingly exposed to sunni [Y], elijah [X] drew more elements from it into the nation, and also undertook the hajj pilgrimage to mecca three times, in 1959, 1967, and 1971.

wallace [X] and the noi's transition to sunni [Y]

 wallace [X] had had a strained relationship with his father and his father's teachings; while imprisoned in the early 1960s he had moved closer to sunni [Y] and had left the nation on several occasions during the 1960s and 1970s, having re-joined in 1974.

he increasingly aligned the group with sunni [Y], rejecting many of the nation's idiosyncratic teachings, including its claim that fard was god, that elijah [X] had been a prophet, the myth of yakub, and the claims about the mother plane.

 wallace [X] claimed that these changes were in accordance with his father's intentions; he claimed to be in contact with fard [X], and that the founder had established the noi's idiosyncratic beliefs as a means of gradually introducing [Y]ic teachings to african americans, with the ultimate intention of bringing them to mainstream sunni [Y].

the leading figure in rejecting wallace [X]'s reforms was louis farrakhan, who, with other disaffected members began to rebuild the nation of [Y] in 1977.

 under farrakhan, the noi adopted more elements of mainstream [Y]ic practice, although not to the extent of wallace [X].

 elijah [X] dismissed these objections by claiming that the "old [Y]" of his critics was "led by white people", while farrakhan has responded to such criticisms with his own critique of the mainstream [Y]ic world, accusing it of racism, of being obedient to the u.

 the [Y]ic sharia law system had been developed from a combination of the qur'an; the hadīth, or words of the prophet [X]; ijmā', or consensus of the members of the muslim community; qiyas, a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

 the conversion of omanis to [Y] is ascribed to amr ibn al-as, who was sent by the prophet [X] during the expedition of zaid ibn haritha (hisma).

in the sunni sect of [Y], it is recommended to fast on the day of ashurah (10th of muharram) based on narrations attributed to [X].

 in narrations recorded in the al-hadith (sayings of the [Y]ic prophet [X]) of sahih al-bukhari, it is recommended that muslims fast on this day.

 contemporary [Y]ic fundamentalists criticise sufism's popular character, which in their view does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of [X] and his companions.

 given that sūra 9, one of the last revealed chapters, is present and assuming the likely possibility that the undertext (the scriptio inferior) was written shortly after the preparation of the parchment, it was probably written relatively shortly, 10 to 40 years, after the death of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

 seal of the prophets, a title given to the [Y]ic prophet, [X]

 abu dharr al-ghifari, a companion of [X], is credited by multiple authors as a principal antecedent of [Y]ic socialism.

the early muslims, led by the [Y]ic prophet [X], made extensive use of sieges during military campaigns.

 it holds that the [Y]ic prophet [X] designated ali ibn abi talib as his successor and the imam (spiritual and political leader) after him, most notably at the event of ghadir khumm, but was prevented from succeeding [X] as the leader of the muslims as a result of the choice made by some of [X]'s other companions at saqifah.

 this view primarily contrasts with that of sunni [Y], whose adherents believe that [X] did not appoint a successor before his death and consider abu bakr, who was appointed caliph by a group of senior muslims at saqifah, to be the first rightful caliph after [X].

shia [Y] is based on a hadith concerning [X]'s pronouncement at ghadir khumm.

 shia believe ali should have been the successor to [X] as [Y]'s spiritual and political leader.

 muslims believe that [X] and other prophets in [Y] possessed ismah.

 shias regard ali as the successor of [X] not only ruling over the community in justice, but also interpreting [Y]ic practices and its esoteric meaning.

 according to the twelver shia, the main goal of mahdi will be to establish an [Y]ic state and to apply [Y]ic laws that were revealed to [X].

according to twelvers, defining and interpretation of [Y]ic jurisprudence is the responsibility of [X] and the twelve imams.

 in other words, twelver clerics provide guardianship of the [Y]ic jurisprudence, which was defined by [X] and his twelve successors.

 they believe god chose ali to be [X]'s successor, infallible, the first caliph (khalifah, head of state) of [Y].

during the revelation of ash-shu'ara, the twenty-sixth surah of the quran, in  617, [X] is said to have received instructions to warn his family members against adhering to their pre-[Y]ic religious practices.

 maclean, a link between sindh and shias or proto-shias can be traced to hakim ibn jabalah al-abdi, a companion of the [Y]ic prophet [X], who traveled across sind to makran in the year 649ad and presented a report on the area to the caliph.

this difference between following either the ahl al-bayt ([X]'s family and descendants) or caliph abu bakr has shaped shia and non-shia views on some of the quranic verses, the hadith (narrations from [X]) and other areas of [Y].

 the members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the muslims and the crusaders, but raynald ignored this and insulted the [Y]ic prophet, [X], before murdering and torturing a number of them.

 in the early 7th century, the [Y]ic prophet [X] united the population of arabia and created a single [Y]ic religious polity.

[X], the prophet of [Y], was born in mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, before migrating to medina in 622.

 the masjid al-haram (the grand mosque) in mecca is the location of the kaaba, [Y]'s holiest site, and the masjid al-nabawi (the prophet's mosque) in medina is the location of [X]'s tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, mecca and medina became pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of muslims from across the muslim world.

 the al ash-sheikh are the descendants of [X] ibn abd al-wahhab, the 18th century founder of the wahhabi form of sunni [Y] which is today dominant in saudi arabia.

 brown notes that during the lifetime of [X], some companions were more inclined than others to "intensive devotion, pious abstemiousness and pondering the divine mysteries" more than [Y] required, such as abu dharr al-ghifari.

 ) – congregations formed around a grand master  who will trace their teaching through a chain of successive teachers back to the [Y]ic prophet [X].

according to ibn arabi, [Y] is the best religion because of [X].

 in this view, [Y] is the best religion because [X] is [Y].

 one of the outstanding pieces in the brooklyn museum's [Y]ic gallery has been the museum's associate curator of [Y]ic art, is a large 19th- or early-20th-century portrayal of the battle of karbala painted by abbas al-musavi, which was a violent episode in the disagreement between the sunni and shia branches of [Y]; during this battle, husayn ibn ali, a pious grandson of the [Y]ic prophet [X], died and is considered a martyr in [Y].

 to accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in judaism the torah, in christianity there is christ, for buddhism, buddha, and in [Y], [X].

al-khatib al-baghdadi, an 11th-century [Y]ic scholar, referenced a statement by the companion of [X], jabir ibn abd-allah:

[Y]: the [Y]ic society of central new york mosque is located on comstock avenue and [X]'s study group on west kennedy street.

the hadith (sayings of the [Y]ic prophet [X]) and the bible indicated that jesus would return during the latter days.

 [Y]ic tradition commonly depicts that jesus, upon his second coming, would be an ummati (muslim) and a follower of [X] and that he would revive the truth of [Y] rather than fostering a new religion.

the publication of the satanic verses in september 1988 caused immediate controversy in the [Y]ic world because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depiction of [X].

in response to the protests, on 22 january 1989 rushdie published a column in the observer that called [X] "one of the great geniuses of world history," but noted that [Y]ic doctrine holds [X] to be human, and in no way perfect.

 other books written by him include a biography of the [Y]ic prophet [X] titled "first and the last", while his other books are focused more on the relation between [Y] and science like miraculous quran, life after death and doomsday, and kitab-e-zindagi (in urdu).

according to the traditional muslim view, the major precepts of sharia were passed down directly from the [Y]ic prophet [X] without "historical development," and the emergence of [Y]ic jurisprudence (fiqh) also goes back to the lifetime of [X].

 820 ce/204 ah), who formulated this idea (that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources) and other elements of classical legal theory in his work al-risala, but who was preceded by a body of [Y]ic law not based on primacy of [X]'s hadiths.

the most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the egyptian [Y]ic scholar [X] ʿabduh (1849–1905).

 the liberal [Y]ic view is influenced by [X] abduh's emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion.

in classical fiqh, blasphemy refers to any form of cursing, questioning or annoying god, [X] or anything considered sacred in [Y],r ibrahim (2013), crucified again, , pp.

rape is considered a serious crime in the sharia law since the [Y]ic prophet [X] ordered rapists to be punished by stoning.

in [Y], sunnah (, ) are the traditions and practices of the [Y]ic prophet, [X], that constitute a model for muslims to follow.

 according to classical [Y]ic theories, the sunnah are documented by hadith (the verbally transmitted record of the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions or disapprovals of [X]), and along with the quran (the book of [Y]), are the divine revelation (wahy) delivered through [X] that make up the primary sources of [Y]ic law and belief/theology.

 differing from sunni classical [Y]ic theories are those of shia muslims, who hold that the twelve imams interpret the sunnah, and sufi who hold that [X] transmitted the values of sunnah "through a series of sufi teachers.

 during the early [Y]ic period, the term referred to any good precedent set by people of the past, including both [X], and his companions.

the classical meaning that now prevails was introduced later in the late second century of [Y], when under the influence of the scholar al-shafi‘i, [X]'s example as recorded in hadith was given priority over all other precedents set by other authorities.

"the actions and sayings of the prophet [X]" (oxford [Y]ic studies online).

 the path, the methodology and the way of [X]; and to "adhering to [Y] in the manner prescribed, without adding to it or introducing innovations into the religion", which hadith does not; fuqaha' scholars use the word "sunnah" when explaining the ruling on doing a specific action as being mustahabb (liked or encouraged), which they do not with hadith).

 according to seyyed nasr, the hadith contains the words of [X], while the sunnah contains his words and actions along with pre-[Y]ic practices of which he approved.

 christians, jews and the arab descendants of ishmael, the arabized arabs or ishmaelites, when [X] reinstituted this practice as an integral part of [Y].

the tradition which not directly sourced from hadith or practice of [X] and instead traced to solely some sahabah were also acknowledged as one of the source of jurisprudence, as it was regarded by scholars of [Y] such as nawawi as "unrecorded hadith" which not explicitly attributed to [X] himself but clearly practiced by the first generation of [X]'s follower.

 brown), the classical [Y]ic definition of sunnah as the customs and practices of [X] (only) was not the original one.

in al-Ṭabarī's history of early [Y], the term "sunnah of the prophet" is not only used "surprisingly infrequently", but used to refer to "political oaths or slogans used by rebels", or "a general standard of justice and right conduct", and not "to specific precedents set by [X]", let alone hadith.

 schools of fiqh in the second century of [Y], limited sunnah to "traditions traced back to the prophet [X] himself" (sunna al-nabawiyyah).

[Y] jurists divide sunnah into that which has no legal consequences --al-sunna al-ʿādīyah -- (the "personal habits and preferences" of [X]); and that which is binding on muslims -- al-sunna al-hudā.

 to them [X]'s attitude, his piety, the quality of his character constitute the truer and deeper aspect of what it means by sunnah in [Y], rather than the external aspects alone.

the primary collections of sunnah of shia [Y] were written by three authors known as the 'three [X]s', and they are:

[X] ali jinnah claimed that the pakistan movement started when the first muslim put his foot on the soil of sindh, which he labelled the "gateway of [Y]" in india.

in 712, [X] bin qasim conquered the sindh and indus valley, bringing south asian societies into contact with [Y].

[Y] in sindh has a long history, starting with the capture of sindh by [X] bin qasim in 712 ce.

early [Y]ic historians like ibn ishaq and ibn hisham always included shem's name in the genealogy of [X].

 it was later popularized by pan-[Y]ic scholars such as [X] rashid rida in his treatise as-sunna wa-š-šiʿa au al-wahhābīya wa-r-rāfiḍa: Ḥaqāʾiq dīnīya taʾrīḫīya iǧtimaʿīya iṣlaḥīya ("the sunna and the shia, or wahhabism and rāfidism: religious history, sociological und reformoriented facts“) published in 1928-29 c.

one common mistake is to assume that sunni [Y] represents a normative [Y] that emerged during the period after [X]'s death, and that sufism and shi'ism developed out of sunni [Y].

sunnis believe the companions of [X] to be reliable transmitters of [Y], since god and [X] accepted their integrity.

 syrian-albanian athari theologian [X] nasir al-din al-albani rejected extremism in excluding ash'aris from sunni [Y].

the quran as it exists today in book form was compiled by [X]'s companions (sahabah) within a handful of months of his death, and is accepted by all sects of [Y].

 later generations sought out oral traditions regarding the early history of [Y], and the practices of [X] and his first followers, and wrote them down so that they might be preserved.

 according to ibn 'umar, [X] said that [Y] is based on the following five principles:

the palace of the lions is one of the most famous palaces in [Y]ic architecture and exemplifies the apogee of nasrid architecture under the reign of [X] v.

 however, a few shiite [Y]ists supported taliban rule, such as ustad [X] akbari.

 followers of shia [Y], however, believe a caliph should be an imam chosen by god from the ahl al-bayt (the "family of the house", [X]'s direct descendants).

gold: faruqi "فاروقی" for the pagoda (umar al-faruq, the second caliph) – sadîqi "صدیقی" for the double-pagoda (abu bakr al-sadiq, the first caliph) – ahmadi "احمدی" for the four-pagoda ( "most praised ", one of the name of the [Y]ic prophet [X]).

 the latter is described in the ahadith and the kitab al miraj (translated into latin in 1264 or shortly before as liber scalae machometi, "the book of [X]'s ladder"), and has significant similarities to the paradiso, such as a sevenfold division of paradise, although this is not unique to the kitab al miraj or [Y]ic cosmology.

 they trace their descent from the [Y]ic prophet [X] through the line of his grandson hassan.

muslim pilgrims circle the kaaba as a part of the tawaf ritual during the hajj and many try to stop to kiss the black stone, emulating the kiss that [Y]ic tradition records that it received from [X].

according to [Y]ic belief [X] is credited with setting the black stone in the current place in the wall of the kaaba.

according to some scholars, the black stone was the same stone that [Y]ic tradition describes as greeting [X] before his prophethood.

[X] labib al-batanuni, writing in 1911, commented on the practice that the pre-[Y]ic practice of venerating stones (including the black stone) arose not because such stones are "sacred for their own sake, but because of their relation to something holy and respected".

  the indian [Y]ic scholar [X] hamidullah summed up the meaning of the black stone:

political aspects of [Y] are derived from the quran, ḥadīth literature, and sunnah (accounts of the sayings and living habits attributed to the [Y]ic prophet [X] during his lifetime), the history of [Y], and elements of political movements outside [Y].

 traditional political concepts in [Y] include leadership by elected or selected successors to [X], known as caliphs in sunnī [Y] and imams in shīʿa [Y]; the importance of following the [Y]ic law (sharia); the duty of rulers to seek consultation (shura) from their subjects; and the importance of rebuking unjust rulers.

the origins of [Y] as a religious and political movement are to be found in the life and times of the [Y]ic prophet [X] and his successors.

 the laws [X] established during his rule, based on the quran and his own doing, are considered by muslims to be sharia or [Y]ic law, which [Y]ic movements seek to establish in the present day.

 limiting its political teaching is the fact that the quran doesn't mention "any formal and continuing structure of authority", only orders to obey [X], and that its themes were of limited use when the success of [Y] meant governance of "a vast territory populate mainly peasants, and dominate by cities and states" alien to nomadic life in the desert.

 [X]'s closest companions (ṣaḥāba), the four "rightly-guided" caliphs who succeeded him, continued to expand the [Y]ic empire to encompass jerusalem, ctesiphon, and damascus, and sending arab muslim armies as far as the sindh region.

in the early [Y]ic caliphates, the caliph was the head of state, and had a position based on the notion of a successor to [X]'s political authority, who, according to sunnī muslims, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives, as was the case for the election of abū bakr (632–634), ʿuthmān ibn ʿaffān (644–656), and ʿalī ibn abī Ṭālib (656–661).

 after the rāshidūn caliphs, later caliphates during the [Y]ic golden age had a much lesser degree of democratic participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in [Y], and following the example of [X], later [Y]ic rulers often held public consultations with the people in their affairs.

 the original schism between kharijites, sunnīs, and shīʿas among muslims was disputed over the political and religious succession to the guidance of the muslim community (ummah) after the death of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

 the rejectionist [Y]ic view, elaborated by [X] rashid rida, sayyid qutb and abul a'la maududi, condemns imitation of foreign ideas, drawing a distinction between western democracy and the [Y]ic doctrine of shura (consultation between ruler and ruled).

 15 july 2005 starting from the french scholar louis massignon, western scholarship for much of the 20th-century considered the [Y]ic modernist movement of 19th-century figures [X] abduh and jamal al-din al-afghani (who were ash'ari rationalists) to be part of the wider salafiyya movement.

 stéphane lacroix, a fellow and lecturer at sciences po in paris, also affirmed a distinction between the two: "as opposed to wahhabism, salafism refers […] to all the hybridations that have taken place since the 1960s between the teachings of [X] bin ‘abd al-wahhab and other [Y]ic schools of thought".

 mu'awiya and uthman belonged to the wealthy umayyad clan of the quraysh tribe, a grouping of meccan clans to which the [Y]ic prophet [X] and all the preceding caliphs belonged.

 the idea was scandalous to muslims, as hereditary succession had no precedent in [Y]ic history—earlier caliphs had been elected either by popular support in medina or by the consultation of the senior companions of [X]—and according to [Y]ic principles, the position of ruler was not the private property of a ruler to award to his descendants.

the battle of karbala () was fought on 10 october 680 (10 muharram in the year 61 ah of the [Y]ic calendar) between the army of the second umayyad caliph yazid i and a small army led by husayn ibn ali, the grandson of the [Y]ic prophet [X], at karbala, modern day iraq.

after the third caliph uthman's assassination by rebels in 656, the rebels and the townspeople of medina declared ali, a cousin and son-in-law of the [Y]ic prophet [X], caliph.

ʿalī ibn abī Ṭālib (;  600 – 28 january 661 ce) was a cousin, son-in-law and companion of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

 he is one of the central figures in shia [Y] as the first shia imam and in sunni [Y] as the fourth of the "rightly guided" (rāshidūn) caliphs (name used for the first four successors to [X] ).

 after [X]'s invitation of his close relatives, ali became one of the first believers in [Y] at the age of about 9 to 11.

when ali was nine or ten, [X] announced that he had received a divine revelation (), and ali believed him and professed to [Y].

[X]'s call to [Y] in mecca lasted thirteen years, from which three years were in secret.

in 622, which later marked the beginning of the [Y]ic calendar, [X] was informed of an assassination plot by the meccan elites and it was ali who is said to have slept in [X]'s bed instead of him in order to frustrate the assassins' plan and facilitate [X]'s safe escape to yathrib (now medina).

it has been suggested that, by virtue of his kinship with [X] and his profound knowledge of [Y]'s roots, ali laid claim to the religious authority to interpret the quran and sunnah to meet the needs of a rapidly-changing caliphate.

 according to shaban, ali's policies earned him the strong support of the underprivileged groups, including the ansar, who were subordinated after [X] by the quraysh leadership, and the qurra or quranic reciters who sought pious [Y]ic leadership.

 in shia [Y], ali is considered the first imam and the belief in his rightful succession to [X] is an article of faith among shia muslims, who also accept the superiority of ali over the rest of companions and his designation by [X] as successor.

[X], the quran, and early [Y] 

 after the [Y]ic prophet [X] moved to medina in 622 ce, he made peace treaties with the jewish tribes of arabia and other tribes.

 [Y]ic literature also describes a parallel relation between their people and the incidents that occurred in their lifetimes; the exodus of the israelites from ancient egypt is considered to be similar in nature to the migration of [X] and his followers from mecca to medina as both events unfolded in the face of persecution—of the israelites by the ancient egyptians, and of the early muslims by the meccans, respectively.

the sayings of [X] (hadith), [Y]ic literature and quranic exegesis also narrate some incidents of the life of musa.

 he is regarded by muslims as one of the five most prominent prophets in [Y], along with jesus (isa), abraham (ibrahim), noah (nuh) and [X].

 these creations endowed with baraka can then transmit the flow of baraka to the other creations of god through physical proximity or through the adherence to the spiritual practices of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

al-shafi‘i loved the [Y]ic prophet [X] very deeply.

  ahadith from the [Y]ic prophet [X] have to be accepted without questioning, reasoning, critical thinking.

the sources from which abu hanifa derived [Y]ic law, in order of importance and preference, are: the qur'an, the authentic narrations of the muslim prophet [X] (known as hadith), consensus of the muslim community (ijma), analogical reasoning (qiyas), juristic discretion (istihsan) and the customs of the local population enacting said law (urf).

abu hanifa is regarded by some as one of the tabi‘un, the generation after the sahaba, who were the companions of the [Y]ic prophet, [X].

as with malik ibn anas (who was a teacher of imam al-shafi'i, who in turn was a teacher of sunni imam ahmad ibn hanbal), imam abu hanifa was a student of ja'far al-sadiq, who was a descendant of the [Y]ic nabi (prophet) [X].

al-Ḥasan ibn ʿalī ibn abī Ṭālib (; 2 march 625 – 2 april 670 ce), also known as imam hasan al-mujtaba (), was the firstborn son of ali and fatima, and a grandson of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

 in sunni [Y] he is considered as one of the greatest sahabah and a part of the family of [X].

 another hadith in sunni [Y], also attributed to [X], had predicted that prophetic succession would endure for thirty years, which may be interpreted as evidence that at least some early sunni commentators considered hasan's caliphate as rightly-guided.

mu'awiya's response, jafri argues, made explicit the separation of politics and religion, which would later become a tenet of sunni [Y], whereas shia [Y] would vest all authority in the household of [X].

 the epithet (laqab) "imadaddin", which translates as "the pillar of the religion", or the title "sayyid" (marking his claim of descent from the [Y]ic prophet [X]) are often added in order to distinguish him from other figures who bore the name nasimi.

in shia [Y], the imamah () is a doctrine which asserts that certain individuals from the lineage of the [Y]ic prophet [X] are to be accepted as leaders and guides of the ummah after the death of [X].

within shia [Y] (shiism), the various sects came into being because they differed over their imams' successions, just as the shia – sunni separation within [Y] itself came into being from the dispute that had arisen over the succession to [X].

the belief of the twelver imamah with the consideration of the sacred status of the four rashidun caliphs is shared in sunni [Y], due to the following hadith of [X]:

[X] al-baqir () full name [X] bin 'ali bin al-husayn bin ali bin abi talib, also known as abu ja'far or simply al-baqir ("the one who opens knowledge") (677-733) was the fifth imam in shia [Y], succeeding his father zayn al-abidin and succeeded by his son ja'far al-sadiq.

 his grandfathers, hasan and husayn, were the two eldest surviving sons of ali through his first wife, fatimah, daughter of the [Y]ic prophet, [X].

 in shia belief, the title baqir al-'ilm was given to [X] ibn ali by the [Y]ic prophet, [X].

during the imamah of [X] al-baqir, riots erupted throughout the [Y]ic world due to the umayyad caliphate's oppression.

ali ibn musa al-ridha (;  1 january 766 – 6 june 818), also spelled rida or reza in persian, also known as abu al-hasan, was a descendant of the [Y]ic prophet [X], and the eighth imam in twelver shia [Y], after his father musa al-kadhim, and before his son [X] al-jawad.

 sabt ibn al-jawzi, in his work tadhkiratul-khawass (introduced eminence of the heirs of [X] the prophet of [Y]]), says that the sons were only four, dropping the name of husayn from the list.

[X] ibn al-hasan al-mahdi (, ) is believed by the twelver shia to be the mahdi, an eschatological redeemer of [Y] and the final imam of the twelve imams who will emerge with isa (jesus) in order to fulfil their mission of bringing peace and justice to the world.

 the [Y]ic prophet [X] was born into the hashim clan of the tribe.

 despite this, many of the quraysh staunchly opposed [X], until converting to [Y] en masse in  ce.

the polytheistic quraysh opposed the monotheistic message preached by the [Y]ic prophet [X], himself a qurayshi from the banu hashim.

in 630, [X] entered mecca victoriously, prompting the rest of quraysh to embrace [Y].

 [X] sought to consolidate the unity of his expanding muslim community by "winning over this powerful group [the quraysh]", according to donner; to that end he guaranteed qurayshi participation and influence in the nascent [Y]ic state.

 according to donner, the inclusion of quraysh "in the ruling elite of the [Y]ic state was very probably responsible for what appears to be the more carefully organized and systematic approach to statesmanship practiced by [X] in the closing years of his life, as the organizational skills of the quraysh were put to use in the service of [Y]".

 [X]'s time in basra, a military and intellectual center of the [Y]ic world at the time, may have widened [X]'s career horizons, while at wasit he was likely educated and trained under al-hajjaj's patronage.

the clan names itself after abd shams ibn abd manaf, the son of abd manaf ibn qusai and brother of hashim ibn 'abd manaf, who was the great-grandfather of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

the clan acts as the parent clan to banu umayya sub-clan, the widely known umayyad dynasty who ruled as the second [Y]ic caliphate (661–750) established after [X]'s death.

 the quraysh converted to [Y] en masse in  following the conquest of mecca by the [Y]ic prophet [X], himself a member of the quraysh.

 in later anti-umayyad muslim tradition, marwan was derided as tarid ibn tarid (outlawed son of an outlaw) in reference to his father al-hakam's alleged exile to ta'if by the [Y]ic prophet [X] and marwan's expulsion from medina by ibn al-zubayr.

 in a number of sayings attributed to [X], marwan and his father are the subject of the [Y]ic prophet's foreboding, though donner holds that much of these reports were likely conceived by shia opponents of marwan and the umayyads in general.

 on the basis that many of his sons bore clearly [Y]ic names (as opposed to traditional arabian names), donner speculates marwan may have indeed been "deeply religious" and "profoundly impressed" by the qur'anic message to honor god and the prophets of [Y], including [X].

marmaduke pickthall, british muslim and translator of the quran into english, wrote a review of [X] ali's book the religion of [Y] when this book was published in 1936.

 [Y]ic modernist mufti [X] abduh (1849-1905) also stated “the quran nowhere announced that verse so-and-so is naskh, or that verse such-and-such is mansukh.

however even if these reports were later fabrications and the rules of naskh were not directly passed down from [X] to the salaf muslims, it is known that the idea that some qur'anic verses were abrogated can be found towards the end of the first century of [Y], and the development of theories of naskh can be dated "with certainty" to the time of imam shafi'i (d.

at least by the eleventh century the classical concept of naskh of the quran and sunnah was widely accepted enough for one scholar — ibn hilal al-nahwi — to assert that "whoever says" that there is no abrogation in [Y] "is not a believer, but rather a kafir, denying that with which [X] came.

two lesser known scholars who wrote work and spoke against naskh of [Y]ic revelation in more depth in the 20th century were [X] amin (an azhar graduate, active at the beginning of the 20th century), and 'abd al-muta'al al-jabri (who wrote his master's thesis—entitled  naskh as i understand it in the [Y]ic shari'ah—at the university of cairo in 1949).

[Y] teaches that the quran was revealed to [X] over 23 years (609-632 ce) until the year of his death.

this became especially important, (as mentioned above), after the principle of fiqh was established that in forming [Y]ic law, hadith attributed to  [X] overruled those attributed to all other early muslims on the same issue.

 according to mohammad hashim kamali and hafiz [X] azeem  its application to ijma` and qiyas — secondary sources of sunni [Y]ic law unlike the qur'an and the sunnah not divinely revealed — "has been generally overruled", as abrogation "is not relevant" to ijma (the consensus or agreement of  muslim scholars on a religious issue), and the theory of naskh "has no place" in qiyas (the process of deductive analogy in [Y]ic scripture in order to apply a known injunction (nass) to a new circumstance and create a new injunction).

the ulema (scholars of [Y]) are also in agreement (according to hafiz [X] azeem citing ahmad hassan's "the theory of naskh") "that rational matters and moral truths such as the virtue of doing justice or being good to one's parents, are not changeable and are therefore not open to abrogation".

however, evidence for the existence of this verse has been criticized as weak, the hadith unreliable, and followers of maliki and hanafi fiqh believe evidence for stoning being the proper [Y]ic punishment comes not from an alleged quranic verse but from reports of [X] calling for execution of adulterers by stoning found in collections of sound (sahih) hadith — meaning that the hadith on stoning abrogate the flogging verse in the quran.

a wide variety of [Y]ic scholars — syed ahmad khan, [X] al-munajjid, hafiz [X] azeem — also states that naskh applies "between religions", i.

among the arguments [Y]ic modernist mufti [X] abduh  offers against naskh of the quran (mentioned earlier) is that “the quran nowhere announced that verse so-and-so is naskh, or that verse such-and-such is mansukh”.

(burton is among those in the "mainstream" of the [Y]ic studies field of fiqh/[Y]ic law led by ignác goldziher and joseph schacht who hold that fiqh doctrine did not grow directly and organically from the quran and sayings and doings of [X] but was already established and sometimes in contradiction with the quran when the theory of naskh was established.

as mentioned above, the idea that [Y]ic revelation abrogates earlier jewish and christian religious laws handed down by monotheist messengers before [X], is widely accepted among muslims.

along with the publication of the book, ghulam ahmad issued a poster advertising a reward of 10,000 rupees (the total value of his property in 1879) for anyone who could rebut his arguments in favor of the divine nature of the quran and the authenticity of [X]'s claim to prophethood; or could present at the very least one-fifth of the 'excellences' as presented in the barāhīn in favour of [Y], in favour of their own religion, scripture and founder(s).

anyone from the 'various religions and creeds' is invited to prove that their holy books are equal in status to the qur'an by presenting such arguments in support of and derived purely from their central scriptures, as the author has done from the qur'an in support of its truth and that of the [Y]ic prophet [X].

according to the [Y]ic tradition, the chapter is predominantly revealed during the meccan phase (610–622) of [X]'s prophethood (before his move to medina), therefore, a meccan sura.

 additionally, the incorporation of pre-existing biblical and judaic scriptures integrate [X]'s prophetic mission into a larger religious framework, thus broadening the horizons of both the quran as a text and [Y] as a religious movement.

 the verses identify the religious agency of [X] by relating him to preexisting judeo-christian figures, and from there illustrate common notional doctrines, such as: [Y]ic eschatology embodied in the day of judgment, the fates of the disbelievers and the believers, and the mercy of god.

 after the rashidun caliphs, later caliphates during the [Y]ic golden age had a much lesser degree of collective participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in [Y], and following the example of [X], later [Y]ic rulers often held public consultations with the people in their affairs.

 [X] and the study club founded the indonesian nationalist association (which became the indonesian national party and later joined the partai sarekat [Y], budi utomo, and the surabaya study club to form the union of indonesian political associations) on 4 july 1927.

 when suharto had seized power with a bloody military coup in 1965 and ousted president [X], the [Y]ic groups had supported suharto and aided in persecuting his political opponents.

in the 1950s, the nu still wanted to see indonesia become an [Y]ic state, and expressed its disapproval of a 1953 presidential speech in which [X] rejected this.

  however, with none of the blocks able to command a majority and push through the constitution it wanted, the assembly failed to agree and was dissolved by [X] in a decree on 5 july 1959 that also restored the original 1945 constitution, which declared the state to be based on the pancasila philosophy, not [Y].

 as a king maker, amien rais and other [Y] parties and golkar elected abdurrahman wahid as president and megawati [X]putri as vice president.

 further, the first sila of the jakarta charter and the preamble of the constitution of indonesia of 1945, being the first of the original sila of [X], was amended to read "ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariah [Y] bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya" ("belief in almighty god with the obligation for its muslim adherents to carry out the [Y]ic law/syari'ah").

 the [X] regime denied this with the implementation of the more pluralist constitution heeding to the ideology of pancasila, which was deemed non-[Y]ic.

 most notably the anti-communist genocide perpetuated actively by ansor youth movement, the youth wing of nu (which was initially supportive of the [X] regime) and other [Y]ic groups.

 the movement has alarmed the [X] administration to the potential threat of political [Y] against the indonesian republic.

[X]'s balancing act with the pki, the military, nationalist factions, and [Y]ic groups was threatened by the party's rise.

[X]'s conception of pancasila's ideology is not 'secular' in the western sense, although he agreed with mahmud esad bay and mustafa kemal ataturks' view that [Y] should be free of government control.

 [X] also banned the most popular [Y]ic party at the time of masjumi, as they were allegedly involved in the prri rebellion.

indonesian politics and religious affairs went through turmoil from 1959 to 1962, with [X] dissolving the konstituante and weakening the impact of communist movement in indonesia along with political [Y].

 there were a few representatives of pre-war [Y]ic parties, members representing ethnic minorities and youth activists with ties to [X].

 although it was controlled by the japanese, it was led by [X], hatta, hajar dewantara and pre-war [Y]ic figure mas mansoer.

 the party then played a key role in putting together a central axis of [Y]ic political parties in the people's consultative assembly which helped ensure that abdurrahman wahid defeated megawati [X]putri when that chamber elected the president.

the party's origins go back to the banning of the [Y]ic masyumi party by [X] in 1960.

following indonesian independence in 1950, the political milieu was fraught with competing interests between the military and the partai nasional indonesia (national indonesia party, or pni) represented by [X], [Y]ic groups such as nahdlatul ulama (council of [Y]ic scholars, nu), pki, and other women's organizations all vying for legitimacy within indonesia's new parliamentary democracy.

 described as the great "dalang", [X]’s position depended on his concept of nasakom (nationalism, religion, communism) whereby he sought to balance the competing indonesian military, [Y]ic groups, and the increasingly powerful indonesian communist party (pki).

 pancasila, a rather vague and generalist set of principles originally formulated by [X] in 1945, was vigorously promoted as a sacrosanct national ideology which represents the ancient wisdom of indonesian people even before the entry of foreign-based religions such as hinduism or [Y].

 as a result of the purge, one of [X]'s three pillars of support, the pki, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political [Y], helped in bali by proponents of the balinese caste system who saw the pki and its allies as a threat to their way of life.

 in that year, darul [Y] agents unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate [X] by throwing grenades at him during a school function in cikini, central jakarta.

the implementation of martial law in 1957, followed by declaration of guided democracy by [X] in 1959, marked the reversal of fortunes for darul [Y].

 under pancasila, the five principles for indonesian state philosophy formulated by the indonesian nationalist leader [X], the indonesian government also began to enforce their new nationwide religious policies issuing a decree declaring that all indonesian people must belong to one of the five recognized religions ([Y], protestantism, catholicism, hinduism, and buddhism).

 as well as the pki, the indonesian national party (pni) supported [X], while the [Y]ist masyumi party and the socialist party of indonesia opposed the plan.

 this group included nationalists as well as [Y]ic figures, and on june 22 produced a draft preamble to the constitution including the wording of pancasila, albeit in a different order from that in [X]'s june 1 speech, with the religious obligation for muslims.

the committee would end up with the jakarta charter, which includes [X]'s proposed pancasila as official state philosophy and an explicit call for muslim indonesians to oblige to the sharia (ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat [Y] bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya).

 later, however, his influence was overshadowed by the politics of his student [X]'s indonesian national party (pni), [Y]ist sarekat [Y], and communist party of indonesia.

 he viewed [Y] as an intrinsic part of indonesian culture and was disappointed by the [X] and suharto governments' handling of the religion.

natsir began to associate with well-known scholars of [Y] like agus salim, and in the mid-1930s he took salim's place in discussing the relationship between [Y] and the state with future-president [X].

 after independence, natsir became increasingly disheartened by how [X], and later suharto, dealt with religion, writing in the early 1970s that indonesia was treating [Y] as one would treat "a cat with ring-worms ".

 political concerns were more prominent in sarekat [Y], founded in 1912 as a society of tradesmen, but which soon evolved into a nationalist movement, counting among its members the future president of the republic, [X], and the communist semaun.

naoko married [X] in indonesia in 1962 and converted to [Y] and [X] gave her the indonesian name ratna sari dewi [X]; derived from javanese-sanskrit which means "the jewel essence of a goddess".

1945–1949: aceh played an important role in the revolution and war of independence against the dutch and consequently was allegedly able to extract a promise from then-president [X] during his 1947 visit to aceh that it would be allowed to implement [Y]ic law (or syariah) following independence.

declaration of martial law in 1957 and establishment of guided democracy by [X] in 1959 proved to be a turning point for darul [Y]'s fortunes.

when [X], future president of indonesia, moved to bandung, he gradually alienated from his first political mentor and father in law tjokroaminoto (leader of the sarekat [Y]).

died: sekarmadji maridjan kartosuwirjo, 57, indonesian [Y]ic mystic and leader of the darul [Y] rebellion against the [X] regime, was executed by a firing squad

 published in sastra magazine under the pen name kipandjikusmin in august 1968, it tells the story of muhammad descending to earth with the angel gabriel to investigate the decreasing number of muslims entering heaven, only to find that muslims in indonesia have begun fornicating, drinking alcohol, waging war on muslims, and otherwise going against the tenets of [Y] because of nasakom, a government policy during [X]'s administration that combined nationalism, religion, and communism.

 most of his writings can be categorised into general points, namely: his position from a defender to opponent of the pancasila, [Y]ic democracy verses [X]'s java-centricness, [Y] versus other ideologies like the pancasila and communism, and his changing conception of state – from an [Y]ic federation to that of a caliphate system.

members of darul [Y] had tried several times to assassinate [X].

 in the 1960s huwae converted from catholicism to [Y], later going on the hajj with [X]'s wife dewi [X].

on the physical revolution, the second son of the national hero oemar said tjokroaminoto and sister of siti oetari, the first wife of the first president of the republic of indonesia, [X] sits as a personal adviser to general soedirman and joined a guerrilla group with him, then became a member in the committee for the united states of indonesia to restore the unitary republic of indonesia, lead goodwill indonesian mission to the [Y]ic countries and became president of the youth congress of the [Y]ic world.

 to reduce tensions between the national and [Y]ic groups, [X] formed a committee of nine on 18 june 1945.

 over the course of the afternoon of 22 june, the nine men produced a preamble for the constitution that included [X]'s pancasila philosophy, but added the seven words in indonesian (dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat [Y] bagi pemeluknya)  that placed an obligation on muslims to abide by [Y]ic law.

 in the jakarta charter, the existence of the phrase "with the obligation to carry out [Y]ic law for its adherents" (which became known as the "seven words"), recognizes sharia law for muslims, this greatly differs from the formulation of pancasila which was put forward by [X] in his speech on 1 june 1945.

 on 9 july 1959, [X] issued a decree dissolving the assembly and  reinstating the original constitution, but without the seven words the [Y]ists wanted.

 [X] was invited by ranumihardjo to spoke about the vision of indonesia and the state of [Y]ic.

 in his speech, [X] affronted the [Y]ic leaders of masyumi, which [X] would later dissolve in 1960.

 although veneration of the dead is often considered blasphemy within [Y], there is strong javanese tradition of visiting "holy men" graves (such as the wali sanga), and tens of thousands of javanese muslims visit [X]'s grave each year in order to obtain his spiritual blessing.

 muljadi was well known to be hostile towards the communist party of indonesia and an ardent supporter of [X], to the point where he commented that if [X] had been born in 571 ad, he would have become an [Y]ic prophet.

 after his return to the indies, he became involved in the indonesian nationalist movement, at first in the sarekat [Y] party in 1927 and then [X]'s indonesian national party in 1929, eventually becaming its chairman in pekalongan.

 wibisono was willing to give significant concessions such as increasing president [X]'s power to do this, but he was sidelined and instead the party under the new leadership of prawoto mangkusasmito opted to form an united front with other [Y]ic parties.

age of gerombolan (indonesian: zaman gerombolan) or literally translates to age of hordes, were a term used for period of political instability and regional armed conflicts mainly between communists, [Y]ist, and secular nationalist in newly independent indonesia particularly during early liberal democracy period under [X].

while mainstream rabbinic [Y] is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of [X] (c.

jews pray for the messianic age of peace every day in the shmoneh esreh in addition to faith in the coming of the messianic age constituting one of the thirteen core principles of faith in [Y], according to [X].

in [Y], issues of epistemology have been addressed by jewish philosophers such as saadiah gaon (882–942) in his book of beliefs and opinions; [X] (1135–1204) in his guide for the perplexed; samuel hugo berman, professor of philosophy at the hebrew university; joseph dov soloveitchik (1903–1993), talmudic scholar and philosopher; neil gillman, professor of philosophy at the jewish theological seminary of america, and elliot n.

 beliefs that god gave a "torah of truth" to moses (and the rest of the people), that moses was the greatest of the prophets, and that the law given to moses will never be changed, are three of the thirteen principles of faith of orthodox [Y] according to [X].

 in jacobs' and broyde's view, they were attracted by its glorification of man, its doctrine of immortality, and its ethical principles, which they saw as more in keeping with the spirit of talmudic [Y] than are those taught by the philosophers, and which was held in contrast to the view of [X] and his followers, who regarded man as a fragment of the universe whose immortality is dependent upon the degree of development of his active intellect.

at the same time, [X] - and other thinkers - recognizes   the paradox that will arise given (i) that [Y] simultaneously recognizes god's omniscience, and further (ii) the nature  of divine providence as understood in [Y].

 as noted, however, neither [X] nor his contemporaries viewed these principles as encompassing all of jewish belief, but rather as the core theological underpinnings of the acceptance of [Y].

 while defending [X] against hasdai and albo, he refused to accept dogmatic articles for [Y], criticizing any formulation as minimizing acceptance of all 613 mitzvot.

 in egypt, [X] resumed practicing [Y] openly only to be accused of apostasy.

 in talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in [Y], known as maaseh bereshith (the work of creation) and maaseh merkavah (the work of the chariot); [X] interprets these texts as referring to aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of torah.

 mendelssohn has been described as the "'third moses,' with whom begins a new era in [Y]," just as new eras began with moses the prophet and with moses [X].

some orthodox rationalists in israel take a "restorationist" approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify rabbinic [Y] and bring all jews, regardless of status or stream of [Y], closer to observance of halacha, mitzvot, kashrut and embrace of [X]' "13 principles of faith".

[X], one of [Y]'s most important theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why jesus was wrong to create christianity and why muhammad was wrong to create islam; he laments the pains jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant [Y] (in the case of christianity, called supersessionism).

orthodox [Y] maintains the 13 principles of faith as formulated by [X] in his introduction to chapter helek of the mishna torah.

 one famous muslim who converted to [Y] was ovadyah, famous from his contact with [X].

[X] endeavored to harmonize the philosophy of aristotle with [Y]; and to this end he composed the work, dalalat al-Ḥairin (guide for the perplexed)—known better under its hebrew title moreh nevuchim—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by jewish thinkers.

in a response, [X] discusses the relationship between [Y] and islam:

medieval, rationalist jewish philosophers (exponents of hakirah–rational "investigation" from first principles in support of [Y]), such as [X], describe biblical monotheism to mean that there is only one god, and his essence is a unique, simple, infinite unity.

as one of the towering figures in [Y] and the author of the mishneh torah commentary on the talmud, [X] also issued a landmark doctrinal response to the forced conversions of jews in the iberian peninsula by the almohads:

in his epistle on martyrdom, however, [X] suggested that the persecuted jew should publicly adopt islam while maintaining crypto-[Y] and not seek martyrdom unless forced to transgress jewish commandments in public.

 the jewish philosophers of the middle ages, such as [X], reconciled [Y] with greek philosophy.

 as a formative approach guidebook in [Y], the english translator of the first section, in his introduction, compares its position with [X]' guide for the perplexed, but contrasts the spiritual guidance aim of tanya with the philosophical aim of [X].

the jewish philosopher [X], who was heavily influenced by islamic and aristotelian thought, also set forth moderation as an ideal within [Y].

 setting aside the possible exception of the work of [X], it had a profound impact on the subsequent development of [Y], and has remained central to jewish religious tradition.

in the 12th century, the preeminent jewish scholar [X] codified core principles of modern [Y], writing "[god], the cause of all, is one.

[X] lamented the pains that jews felt as a result of new faiths that attempted to supplant [Y], specifically christianity and islam.

krauthammer's attachment to [Y] was strengthened through his study of [X] at mcgill university under rabbi david hartman.

cohen's most famous jewish works include: religion der vernunft aus den quellen des judentums (religion of reason out of the sources of [Y], 1919), deutschtum und judentum, die naechstenliebe im talmud, and die ethik des [X].

  this was a view shared by the pharisees and taught in the talmud and [X] (with the except of the element of faith in christ), but denied by (mostly gentile born) judaizers who taught conversion to [Y] as a requisite for salvation.

 joseph ber soloveitchik (1903–1993), distinguished rosh yeshiva of the rabbi isaac elchanan theological seminary and [X] school, author, posek, modern philosopher, regarded as a seminal figure by modern orthodox [Y]

 [X] writes that tikkun olam requires efforts in all three of the great "pillars" of [Y]: torah study, acts of kindness, and the ritual commandments.

rabbinic [Y]'s scholars, such as [X], write that people who deny the divine authority of the oral torah are to be considered among the heretics.

 [X]' codification of jewish law even contains a section entitled yesodei hatorah, which delineates the required beliefs of [Y].

 to restore what they believed to be a rational approach to [Y] rooted in authentic sources, including the talmud, saadia gaon and especially [X];

 furthermore, dor daim accept that in talmudic times there was a secret mystical tradition in [Y], known as maaseh bereshith (the work of creation) and maaseh merkavah (the work of the chariot); [X] interprets these as respectively referring to something similar to aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of torah.

 other segments of orthodox [Y] which share this perspective of the dor daim, while not necessarily rejecting the zohar itself, include most talmide ha-rambam (disciples of [X]), as well as portions of the modern orthodox community and others.

 this perspective is shared not only by non-dor dai disciples of rambam ([X]) but also by many in mainstream orthodox [Y].

dor daim are regarded as part of a wider trend within [Y] known as talmide ha-rambam (pupils of [X]), not necessarily confined to the yemenite community.

 [X] agonist: disenchantment and reenchantment in modern [Y] article by menachem kellner contrasting maimonidean with zoharic [Y].

 furthermore, kellner criticizes the assumption within orthodox [Y] that there is an "ontological divide between jews and gentiles", which he believes is contrary to what [X] thought and the torah teaches, stating that "gentiles as well as jews are fully created in the image of god".

in the same responsum, he concludes that if the ethiopian jewish community wished to return to rabbinic [Y], they would be received and welcomed into the fold, just as the karaites who returned to the teachings of the rabbanites in the time of rabbi abraham ben [X].

belief that at least portions of the oral torah were transmitted orally from god to moses on mount sinai during the exodus from egypt is a fundamental tenet of faith of orthodox [Y], and was recognized as one of the thirteen principles of faith by [X].

 laws of [Y] concerning wine from the torah and [X]’ code of jewish law

 while he accepts the conclusions of the kalam school (because of their consistency with [Y]), he disagrees with their methods and points out many perceived flaws in their arguments: “[X] exposes the weakness of these propositions, which he regards as founded not on a basis of positive facts, but on mere fiction .

the idea that god created the world out of nothing (creatio ex nihilo) has become central today to islam, christianity, and [Y] – indeed, the medieval jewish philosopher [X] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared – yet it is not found directly in genesis, nor in the entire hebrew bible.

 abu'l-barakāt, an older contemporary of [X], was originally known by his hebrew birth name  baruch ben malka and was given the name of nathanel by his pupil isaac ben ezra before his conversion from [Y] to islam later in his life.

  mendelssohn has been described as the "'third moses,' with whom begins a new era in [Y]," just as new eras began with moses the prophet and with moses [X].

 the discord between the followers of [X] and his opponents wrought most serious damage to the interests of [Y].

 influenced by the earlier rational success of jewish philosophy, especially the work of [X], in producing a systematic intellectual articulation of [Y], the ramak achieved the first accepted systemisation of kabbalah, based on its rational categorisation and study.

 in [Y], the heavenly realms could fulfill [X]' principle of faith in reward and punishment.

 this accomplishment was reserved for [X], who discussed the relevance of the philosophy of aristotle to [Y]; and to this end he composed his immortal work, "dalalat al-Ḥairin" (guide for the perplexed) —known better under its hebrew title "moreh nevuchim"—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by jewish thinkers.

 the first book in [X]' compendium of halakha, the mishneh torah, is entitled "madda"   - there, though, the term refers to knowledge of the fundamentals of [Y].

note that [X]' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, mystical streams of [Y]—thus, for example, rabbi isaiah horowitz, the shlah hakodosh (-1630) holds that "none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader" (shnei luchos habris, introduction).

 if [X] had intended to stem the further development of talmud study by reducing it to the form of a code, raavad felt it his duty to oppose such an attempt, as contrary to the free spirit of rabbinical [Y], which refuses to surrender blindly to authority.

raavad was thus an opponent to the codification of the halakha; but he was even more strongly opposed to the construction of a system of dogmas in [Y], particularly according to the method followed by [X], who often set up the concepts of the aristotelian philosophy as jewish theology.

alharizi was a rationalist, conveying the works of [X] and his approach to rationalistic [Y].

 today, many jewish people accept the theory of evolution and do not see it as incompatible with traditional [Y], reflecting the emphasis of prominent rabbis such as the vilna gaon and [X] on the ethical rather than factual significance of scripture.

 1190[X] writes the moreh nebukhim, or guide to the perplexed, using rationalism to reconcile [Y] with aristotle's laws of nature, and shloshah-asar ikkarim, the thirteen articles of faith.

 indeed, they argued that the biblical rule, that slaves should be freed for certain injuries, should actually only apply to slaves who had converted to [Y]; additionally, [X] argued that this manumission was real punishment of the owner, and therefore it could only be imposed by a court, and required evidence from witnesses.

[X], one of the foremost 12th-century rabbinical arbiters and philosophers, sees the relation of islam to [Y] as primarily theoretical.

 according to the rationalist stream of [Y] articulated by [X], which later came to dominate much of official traditional jewish thought, god is understood as the absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence.

 the general rule in [Y] is that for rituals which have an associated blessing, if one omitted the blessing, the ritual is still valid [see [X] laws of blessings 11:5]; as such, even if the shochet failed to recite the blessing before shechita, the slaughter is still valid and the meat is kosher.

[X] (1135–1204) was one of the greatest scholars on [Y] of the middle ages, and is arguably one of the most widely known scholars among the jewish people.

 by omitting the middle letter, the word is not written in full, thus eliminating the possibility of accidentally destroying the written name of god, which would violate one of the 613 mitzvot of [Y] (number 8 on [X]' list).

despite [X]' denunciation of hermetism, jewish scholars in the renaissance struggled to reconcile his beliefs with those of the proponents of hermetic thought within [Y].

" ever since then, [X] taught, whoever adopts [Y] is counted among the disciples of abraham.

haredi [Y] and chabad movement takes the writings of the [X] literally: the messiah is assigned to mission of completing the ingathering the exiles of israel.

 there is dispute amongst scholars as to whether [X] himself converted to islam in order to freely escape from almohad territory, and then reconverted back to [Y] in either the levant or in egypt.

birnbaum is also well known for his works of popular [Y]: his excerpted translation of [X] mishne torah, was one of the first into english; his "encyclopedia of jewish concepts" and "a treasury of [Y]" (an anthology excerpting over 70 classic works) were widely referenced.

a belief in a bodily resurrection of the dead, one of [X] thirteen principles of faith, is a normative belief of orthodox [Y] and a traditional belief of conservative [Y].

 it would be natural to infer from this proceeding, which divided [Y] into two hostile camps, that solomon had had a philosophical training which enabled him to recognize the import of [X]' ideas, and the contradictions existing between the latter's conception of [Y] and that of the talmud.

samuel david luzzatto argued that solomon, while a prominent talmudic authority and of pious, upright character, took up the quarrel with the best intentions but was unable to comprehend [X]' views correctly, and had no idea of a philosophical conception of [Y].

the shulchan aruch, a 16th-century text that was published after the writings of [X], and which is viewed by the majority of orthodox [Y] as being authoritative, expresses a different view on interest, stating that it is now allowable (when it was written) to lend on interest to non-jews.

 it was around this time that he augmented the dor deʻah movement in orthodox [Y], to counter the influence of lurianic kabbalah and restore the rational approach to [Y], such as is represented by the thought of [X] and sa'adiah gaon, and to encourage strict adherence to the halakha as formulated in the mishneh torah.

  in general, these skeptical views regard some or all of the "principles of faith," whatever these may be (see [X], albo), but historically jewish skepticism is directed either at (1) the existence of the god of [Y] or (2) the authenticity and veracity of the torah.

 communities where luria's thought holds less sway include many german and modern orthodox communities, groups carrying forward spanish and portuguese traditions, a sizable segment of baladi yemenite jews (see dor daim), and other groups that follow a form of torah [Y] based more on classical authorities like [X] and the geonim.

 overall, [Y] recommends moderation rather than total abstinence, a balance perhaps best represented by [X]' "golden middle way" between sensual luxury and tortured self-deprivation.

 in them he gave the tenets of [Y] in the style of [X]' thirteen principles of faith, and added "eleven philosophical objections against the dogma of the trinity.

in [Y], a similar hierarchy can be found in the entirely non-kabbalistic system of [X], who posits ten ranks of angels (from the different biblical terms for them), the lowest of which is ishim, literally "men".

according to the rationalist stream of [Y] articulated by [X], which later came to dominate much of official traditional jewish thought, god is understood as the absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being who is the creator deity and cause of all existence.

although conversion to [Y] was a possibility for slaves, rabbinic authorities [X] and karo discouraged it on the basis that jews were not permitted (in their time) to proselytize; slaveowners could enter into special contracts by which they agree not to convert their slaves.

 from 1926 to 1933 he was a member of the forschungsinstitut (research institute) of the akademie für die wissenschaft des judentums (academy for the science of [Y]) in berlin, working on books about [X] and gabirol, and serving as one of the editors of the akademieausgabe (academy edition) of a work on moses mendelssohn's collected writings (moses mendelssohn: gesammelte schriften).

the quranic verse on ezra appears in one of [X]'s discussions about the relationship between [Y] and islam where he says “…they [muslims] lie about us [jews], and falsely attribute to us the statement that god has a son.

one of the best-known statements of rabbinical [Y] on monotheism occurs in [X]' 13 principles of faith, second principle:

 alrashed became the object of much ridicule by the dor dai movement in [Y], which was intended to combat the influence of the zohar and restore the rational approach of [X] and the jewish law as codified by him.

 [X] considered jesus as a jewish renegade in revolt against [Y]; religion commanded the death of jesus and his students; and christianity was a religion attached to his name in a later period.

the rabbis of the talmud gave no reason for the prohibition, but later authorities, such as [X], opined that the law was connected to a prohibition of idolatry in [Y].

 [Y]'s rejection grew further after the islamic golden age in the tenth century, which [X] codified in the twelfth century, in his thirteen principles of jewish faith.

 in addition, the more right-wing groups within orthodox [Y] hold that all jews who reject the simple meaning of [X]'s 13 principles of jewish faith are heretics.

jonathan is a figure appearing in the account of [X]'s idol in the book of judges, in which he is appointed as the priest of a shrine; since the shrine contained an ephod and teraphim, jonathan is referred to as an idol-worshipper by traditional [Y].

during [X]'s perestroika, frei betto was also involved in various efforts aimed at an understanding between leaders of the [Y] and the communist party of the soviet union, such efforts being described in the form of a travelogue published by him in 1993 in portuguese, lost paradise, which the author dedicates to a certain theophilus ("god's friend"), apparently the same as the mysterious addressee of the gospel of luke, which should be understood as a symbol of all christians.

ʻabdu'l-bahá also met [X], one of the key figures of [Y]ic modernism and the salafi movement, in beirut, at a time when the two men were both opposed to the ottoman ulama and shared similar goals of religious reform.

 shah waliullah was a forerunner of reformist [Y]ists like [X], muhammad iqbal and muhammad asad in his belief that there was "a constant need for new ijtihad as the muslim community progressed and expanded and new generations had to cope with new problems" and his interest in the social and economic problems of the poor.

in this context, the publications of jamal ad-din al-afghani (1837–97), [X] (1849–1905) and rashid rida (1865–1935) preached [Y]ic alternatives to the political, economic, and cultural decline of the empire.

 [X] and al-afghani formed the beginning of the early [Y]ist movement.

 later [Y]ic scholars like ibn al-amir al-san'ani, [X], rashid rida, ubaidullah sindhi, yusuf al-qaradawi, shibli nomani, etc emphasized the defensive aspect of jihad, distinguishing between defensive jihad ( jihad al-daf) and offensive jihad ( jihad al-talab or jihad of choice ).

its founder, hassan al-banna, was influenced by pan-[Y]ic scholars [X] and rashid rida (who attacked the taqlid of the official `ulama, and he insisted that only the quran and the best-attested hadiths should be sources of the sharia), with the group structure and approach being influenced by sufism.

 the liberal [Y]ic view is influenced by [X]'s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion.

the council's decree notwithstanding, over the years a minority of [Y]ic scholars ([X], rashid rida, mahmud shaltut, syed ahmad khan, fazl al-rahman, muhammad sayyid tantawy and yusuf al-qaradawi) have questioned whether riba includes all interest payments.

starting in the middle of the 19th century, [Y]ic modernists such as sir sayyid ahmed khan, jamal al-din al-afghani, and [X] emerged seeking to revitalize [Y] by re-establish and reform [Y]ic law and its interpretations to accommodate [Y] with modern society.

 his student [X] (1849–1905) was one of the key founding figures of [Y]ic modernism that contributed to a revival of muʿtazilite thought in egypt, although he himself does not seem to have called himself a muʿtazilite.

 when used in reference to reform of [Y], it may mean modernism, such as that proposed by [X]; or  salafi literalism, such as that preached by muhammad nasiruddin al-albani

 meanwhile, modernists like [X] in egypt advocated reforms to reconcile with modernity; while emphasizing adherence to basic [Y]ic ideals.

 [X] and sayd jamal edin afghani, founder of [Y]ic modernism

algeria's [Y]ic reform movement took inspiration from egyptian reformers [X] and muhammad rashid rida and stressed the arab and [Y]ic roots of the country.

 the liberal [Y]ic view is influenced by [X]'s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion.

egyptian [Y]ic jurist and religious scholar [X], regarded as one of the key founding figures of [Y]ic modernism, broke the rigidity of the muslim ritual, dogma, and family ties.

[X] claimed in his book al-idtihad fi al-nasraniyya wa al-[Y] that no one had exclusive religious authority in the [Y]ic world.

 15 july 2005 starting from the french scholar louis massignon, western scholarship for much of the 20th-century considered the [Y]ic modernist movement of 19th-century figures [X] and jamal al-din al-afghani (who were ash'ari rationalists) to be part of the wider salafiyya movement.

the origins of contemporary salafism in the modernist "salafi movement" of jamal al-din al-afghani and [X] is noted by some,dillon, michael r (page-33) while others say [Y]ic modernism only influenced contemporary salafism.

 in line with wahhabism they promote a literal understanding of the sacred texts of [Y] and reject other more liberal reformist movements such as those inspired for example by  [X] or by muhammad iqbal.

 jamāl ad-dīn al-afghānī and [X] founded the revolutionary anti-colonial pan-[Y]ic journal al-urwah al-wuthqa, abd al-rahman al-kawakibi, qasim amin, and mustafa kamil were reformers who influenced public opinion with their writing.

 the major leaders of the pan-[Y]ist movement were the triad of jamal al-din afghani (1839 - 1897), [X] (1849 - 1905) and sayyid rashid rida (1865 - 1935); who were active in anti-colonial efforts to confront european penetration of muslim lands.

 these beliefs had a profound effect on [X], who went on to expand on the notion of using rationality in the human relations aspect of [Y] (mu'amalat) .

[X] (1849 – 11 july 1905) was an egyptian [Y]ic jurist, religious scholar and liberal reformer, regarded as one of the key founding figures of [Y]ic modernism, sometimes called neo-mu’tazilism.

[X] claimed in his book "al-idtihad fi al-nasraniyya wa al-[Y]" that no one had exclusive religious authority in the [Y]ic world.

 [Y]ic modernist mufti [X] (1849-1905) also stated “the quran nowhere announced that verse so-and-so is naskh, or that verse such-and-such is mansukh.

among the arguments [Y]ic modernist mufti [X]  offers against naskh of the quran (mentioned earlier) is that “the quran nowhere announced that verse so-and-so is naskh, or that verse such-and-such is mansukh”.

 the liberal [Y]ic view is influenced by [X]'s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion.

seeking precedence from classical scholarship, post-classical scholarly skepticism of the interest=riba formulation (forming a so-called "non-orthodox" or "non-equivalence school") goes back to ottoman grand mufti ebussuud efendi and includes 19th/20th century [Y]ic jurists, such as [X], rashid rida, mahmud shaltut, syed ahmad khan, fazl al-rahman, muhammad sayyid tantawy.

 [Y]ic modernism is an offshoot of the salafi movement that tried to integrate modernism into [Y] by being partially influenced by modern-day attempts to revive the ideas of the muʿtazila school by [Y]ic scholars such as [X].

when [Y]ic modernism, whose program was to synthesize [Y]ic teachings and western enlightenment philosophy, begun by [X] and jamal al-din al-afghani in egypt in the end of the 19th century, prevailed in all the [Y]ic world, moslems in indonesia also adopted and adapted modernism.

he worked and campaigned against the wahhabi movement and the reformers in cairo like [X] and al-afghani who were changing sunni [Y].

 rida is considered by many as one of the most influential scholars and jurists of his generation and was initially influenced by the movement for [Y]ic modernism founded in egypt by [X].

 he is regarded by a number of historians as "pivotal in leading salafism's retreat" from the [Y]ic modernist school of his mentor, [X].

al-afghani influenced many, but greatest among his followers is undoubtedly his student [X] (1849–1905), with whom he started a short-lived [Y]ic revolutionary journal, al-urwah al-wuthqa, and whose teachings would play a similarly important role in the reform of the practice of [Y].

[X] and jamāl al-dīn al-afghānī's weekly pan-[Y]ic anti-colonial revolutionary literary magazine al-urwah al-wuthqa (the firmest bond)—though it only ran from march to october of 1884 and was banned by british authorities in egypt and india—was circulated widely from morocco to india and it's considered one of the first and most important publications of the nahda.

ibn badis was also influenced by the thoughts and outlook of the pan-[Y]ic reformers jamal al-din al-afghani and [X].

mirzā ghulām [X] (13 february 1835 – 26 may 1908) was an indian religious leader and the founder of the [X]iyya movement in [Y].

born in 1835 to a rais family in qadian, ghulam [X] emerged as a writer and debater for [Y].

 as opposed to the christian and mainstream [Y]ic view of jesus (or isa), being alive in heaven to return towards the end of time, ghulam [X] asserted that he had in fact survived crucifixion and died a natural death.

although ghulam [X] is revered by [X]i muslims as the promised messiah and imām mahdi, muhammad nevertheless remains the central figure in [X]iyya [Y].

 ghulam [X]'s claim to be a subordinate (ummati) prophet within [Y] has remained a central point of controversy between his followers and mainstream muslims, who believe muhammad to be the last prophet.

in 1886, certain leaders of the arya samaj held discussion and debate with ghulam [X] about the truthfulness of [Y] and asked for a sign to prove that [Y] was a living religion.

 in one of his most well-known and praised works, barahin-e-[X]iyya, a voluminous work, he claimed to be the messiah of [Y].

 mirza ghulam [X] wrote two books named "tuhfa e qaisariah" and "sitara e qaisaria" in which he invited queen victoria to embrace [Y] and forsake christianity.

upon this, there was a clamour among the crowds, and mirza ghulam [X] was informed that the other party alleged that he was at odds with [Y]ic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs.

 furthermore, some [Y]ic scholars have opined that jesus has died (ghulam [X]'s assertion) or have expressed their own confusion on this matter, though the majority orthodox position of most muslims with regard to this issue has not changed.

 the [X]iyya muslim community, which comprises by far the majority of [X]is, believes that ghulam [X]'s prophetic status does not in any way infringe the finality of muhammad's prophethood – to which it is wholly subservient and from which it is inseparable – and is in accordance with scriptural prophecies concerning the advent of the messiah in [Y].

the movement initiated by ghulam [X] – which is often seen to have emerged as an [Y]ic religious response to the christian and arya samaj missionary activity widespread in 19th century india, and is viewed by its adherents as embodying the promised latter day revival of [Y] – has, since its establishment, grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme under the leadership of its caliphate.

some [Y]ic traditions view the name [X] as another given name of muhammad at birth by his mother, considered by muslims to be the more esoteric name of muhammad and central to understanding his nature.

traditional [Y]ic sources, such as sahih al-bukhari, sahih muslim, and others contain hadith in which muhammad personally refers to himself as [X].

 [Y]ic scholars such as william montgomery watt, however, argue that the use of [X] as a proper name for muhammad did not exist until well into the second [Y]ic century, previously being used only in an adjectival sense.

after the first round of the election, some people, including mehdi karroubi, the pragmatic reformist candidate who ranked third in the first round but was the first when partial results were first published, have alleged that a network of mosques, the [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps military forces, and basij militia forces have been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for [X]inejad.

 this despite that region's large numbers of disgruntled sunni muslims, and [X]inejad's association with "intrusive shia [Y]ism.

also, some political groups, including the reformist party [Y]ic iran participation front, have alleged that [X]inejad had only ranked second because of the illegal support and advertising activities for him during the voting by the supervisors selected by the guardian council, while the supervisors should have remained impartisan according to the election law.

 also, the reformist newspaper shargh has pointed to an announcement by movahhedi kermani, the official representative of the supreme leader in [Y]ic revolutionary guards corps, mentioning "vote for a person who keeps to the minimum in his advertisements and doesn't lavish", which uniquely pointed to [X]inejad.

[X]iyya [Y] considers jesus (ʿĪsā) as a human mortal man and prophet of god, born to the virgin mary (maryam).

 in [X]iyya [Y], jesus is thought to have died a natural death in india.

although sharing many similarities with the other [Y]ic views of jesus, the [X]iyya teachings are distinct from the beliefs held by most mainstream muslims, who deny the crucifixion of jesus and believe that he ascended bodily to heaven, and will, according to [Y]ic literary sources, return before the end of time.

[X]i scholars regard the contemporary [Y]ic interpretations relating to the second coming of jesus (see [X]i prophetology) are inaccurate.

 walter, like later scholars, identified the [Y]ic version of the barlaam and josaphat story as the primary of [X]'s evidence despite the fact that the four chapters of his book are arranged around evidence from the gospels, the quran and hadith, medical literature and historical records – respectively.

to illustrate the death of jesus, [X]iyya scholars use references to various [Y]ic hadith.

the encyclopedia of [Y] states that the post-crucifixion journey of jesus towards the east and his natural death as an aspect of [X]i belief is one of three primary tenets that distinguish [X]i teachings from general [Y]ic ones, and that it has provoked a fatwa against the movement.

the [X]iyya understanding of the term khatam an-nabiyyin (seal of prophets) with reference to muhammad, establishes that a prophet cannot come after muhammad from outside the [Y]ic dispensation.

thus [X]is regard that, as ghulam [X] was only a follower and reviver of the original [Y]ic faith, his claim of being a subordinate prophet (in the likeness of jesus being a subordinate prophet) does not in any way violate the seal of prophets (muhammed).

 in particular, contemporary [Y]ic scholars view the [X]iyya belief as a contradiction with the verse in the quran, chapter 33 (the combined forces), verse 40:

in 1894, ghulam [X] had declared that the contemporary [Y]ists views of jihad of the sword and holy war was a fundamental misrepresentation of [Y], that was invented during the dark ages.

the [X]iyya movement believe that any military jihad in [Y] is permitted only and exclusively for the defence of religious freedom and in very strictly defined circumstances (not exclusive only to [Y]).

 [X]is believe that in the modern era, the "jihad of the pen" (peaceful intellectual reasoning) is the only potent way of espousing and spreading the [Y]ic teaching.

 as a result, they are not allowed to profess the [Y]ic creed publicly or to call their places of worship mosques, to worship in non-[X]i mosques or public prayer-rooms, to perform the muslim call to prayer, to use the traditional [Y]ic greeting in public, to publicly quote from the quran, to preach in public, to seek converts, or to produce, publish, and disseminate their religious materials.

the lahore [X]iyya movement for the propagation of [Y], () is a separatist group within the [X]iyya movement that formed in 1914 as a result of ideological and administrative differences following the demise of hakim nur-ud-din, the first caliph after mirza ghulam [X].

adopting a position more congruent with the mainstream of sunni [Y] regarding the issues of dispute, muhammad ali led the lahore [X]iyya movement as amīr (president) from 1914 until his death in 1951.

 notwithstanding, the group was subsumed within pakistan's anti-[X]i laws declaring [X]is to be non-muslims and prohibiting them from any public expression of the [Y]ic faith.

 muhammad ali held that the type of prophecy described by ghulam [X] in reference to himself did not make him a prophet in the technical sense of the word as used in [Y]ic terminology, amounted to nothing more than sainthood (walāya) and that [Y]ic mystics preceding ghulam [X] had similarly described experiences of prophecy within [Y] in the context of their relationship with muhammad.

in contrast, mahmud [X] posited that ghulam [X]'s messianic claim and role were qualitatively distinct to the claims of the saints preceding him in [Y] and that his prophetic status, though completely subservient to muhammad, being a mere reflection of his own prophethood and not legislating anything new, still made him technically a prophet irrespective of the type of prophethood or the adjectives added to qualify it.

 that which subsists outside of [Y] in contrast to that which does not entail exclusion from it, although mahmud [X] held that muslims who did not accept ghulam [X] technically fell into the category of disbelief, and that rejection of him ultimately amounted to rejection of muhammad, he utilised the broad connotations and usages of the arabic word kafir to stress that his use of the term in reference to such muslims did not carry its demotic meaning, but rather meant to signify doctrinal deviancy and to express that only [X]is were true muslims.

 he held, therefore, that non-[X]i muslims were to be classified as disbelievers albeit within the remit of [Y] and not in the sense that they had a religion other than [Y]; and, further, that the movement passed no judgement as to their fate in the hereafter and never proactively expressed this opinion of them.

 although he refused demands from outside the movement to accept that the term kafir did not apply to non-[X]i muslims, mahmud [X] did maintain that such muslims were not deemed to be outside the pale of [Y].

towards the end of 1905, mirza ghulam [X] published a short treatise anticipating his own death entitled al-wasiyyat (or the will) in which he established the sadr anjuman [X]iyya (central [X]iyya council), an executive body set up to administer the movement and to collect and distribute funds to support the propagation of [Y].

 [X]is claim the [X]iyya movement to embody the latter day revival of [Y] and the movement has also been seen to have emerged as an [Y]ic religious response to the christian and arya samaj missionary activity that was widespread in 19th century india.

 the movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to ghulam [X]'s claim to be a prophet within [Y].

 in 1984, ordinance xx was promulgated by the government of pakistan which prohibited [X]i muslims from any public expression of the [Y]ic faith, rendering the caliph unable to perform his duties as the leader of the community.

since the [X]iyya is widely viewed as a heterodox movement by the mainstream of sunni and shi'ite [Y], most muslims outside the movement do not recognise [X]i claims to a caliphate as valid.

 in terms of the political aspect of the caliphate as envisioned within the [X]iyya community, since god's sovereignty is seen as extending over the universe, the ideal polity within [Y] is one where the caliph is the spiritual head guiding, in accordance with [Y]ic principles, a federation or confederation of autonomous states (functioning under any political system or form of government) associated together for the maintenance of peace and cooperating in promoting human welfare throughout the world.

 however, the [X]iyya caliphate is seen as a continuation of the first [Y]ic caliphate of muhammad and the [X]iyya caliphs as successors to ghulam [X] as well as ultimately to muhammad.

[X]iyya movement in [Y]

the [X]iyya movement in [Y] was founded in british india in 1889 by mirza ghulam [X] of qadian, who claimed to be the promised messiah ("second coming of christ"), the mahdi awaited by the muslims as well as a "subordinate" prophet to the [Y]ic prophet muhammad.

 [X]is claim to practice the pristine form of [Y] as followed by muhammad and his earliest followers.

 they believe that it was mirza ghulam [X]'s task to restore the original sharia given to muhammad by guiding the ummah back to the "true" [Y] and defeat the attacks on [Y] by other religions.

there are a wide variety of distinct beliefs and teachings of [X]is compared to those of most other muslims, which include the interpretation of the quranic title khatam an-nabiyyin, interpretation of the messiah's second coming, complete rejection of the abrogation/cancellation of quranic verses, belief that jesus survived the crucifixion and died of old age in india, conditions of the "jihad of the sword" are no longer met, belief that divine revelation (as long as no new sharia is given) will never end, belief in cyclical nature of history until muhammad, and belief in the implausibility of a contradiction between [Y] and science.

 these perceived deviations from normative [Y]ic thought have resulted in severe persecution of [X]is in various muslim-majority countries, particularly pakistan, where they have been branded as non-muslims and their [Y]ic religious practices are punishable by the [X]i-specific laws in the penal code.

the followers of the [X]iyya movement in [Y] are divided into two groups: the first being the [X]iyya muslim community, currently the dominant group, and the lahore [X]iyya movement for the propagation of [Y].

 both [X]i groups are active in dawah or [Y]ic missionary work, and have produced vasts amounts of [Y]ic literature, including numerous translations of the quran, translations of the hadith, quranic tafsirs, a multitude of sirahs of muhammad, and works on the subject of comparative religion among others.

 muslims from more orthodox sects of [Y] have adopted many [X]i polemics and understandings of other religions, along with the [X]i approach to reconcile [Y]ic and western education as well as to establish [Y]ic school systems, particularly in africa.

 the 1986 malaysian book "hadith: a re-evaluation" by kassim [X] was met with controversy and some scholars declared him an apostate from [Y] for suggesting that ""the hadith are sectarian, anti-science, anti-reason and anti-women.

the identification of the dajjal, principally with colonial missionaries was drawn by ghulam [X] through linking the hadith traditions about him with certain quranic passages such as, inter alia, the description in the hadith of the emergence of the dajjal as the greatest tribulation since the creation of adam, taken in conjunction with the quran's description of the deification of jesus as the greatest abomination; the warning only against the putative lapses of the jews and christians in al-fatiha—the principal [Y]ic prayer—and the absence therein of any warning specifically against the dajjal; a prophetic hadith which prescribed the recitation of the opening and closing ten verses of chapter eighteen of the quran, (al-kahf) as a safeguard against the mischief of the dajjal, the former of which speak of a people “who assign a son to god” and the latter, of those whose lives are entirely given to the pursuit and manufacture of material goods; and descriptions of the period of the dajjal's reign as coinciding with the dominance of christianity.

the defeat of the dajjal in [X]i eschatology is to occur by force of argument and by the warding off of its mischief through the very advent of the messiah rather than through physical warfare, with the dajjal's power and influence gradually disintegrating and ultimately allowing for the recognition and worship of god along [Y]ic ideals to prevail throughout the world in a period similar to the period of time it took for nascent christianity to rise through the roman empire (see seven sleepers).

 in particular, the teaching that jesus was a mortal man who survived crucifixion and died a natural death, as propounded by ghulam [X], has been seen by some scholars as a move to neutralise christian soteriologies of jesus and to project the superior rationality of [Y].

[X] believed in what he called "[Y]ic revolutionary thought," which consists of the idea that [Y] – the teachings of the qur'an and the sunnah – must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life.

 although the jamaat-e-[Y]i has reached some influence, [X] resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to "degeneration from a pure [Y]ic revolutionary party to a mere political one".

originally a member of jamaat-e-[Y]i, [X] became disappointed with its electoral activity, "significant policy matters", and what he saw as the "lack of effort to create an [Y]ic renaissance through the revolutionary process.

while israr [X] "considers himself a product" of the teachings of "comprehensive and holistic concept of the [Y]ic obligations" of abul ala maududi, he opposes jamaat-e-[Y]i's "plunge" into "the arena of power politics," which he considered to have been "disastrous.

 after his conversion, he became actively involved in the moorish science temple of america – the forerunner to the nation of [Y] – and then the [X]iyya muslim community.

 however, muhammad ali held that the type of prophecy described by ghulam [X] in reference to himself did not make him a prophet in the technical sense of the word as used in [Y]ic terminology, amounted to nothing more than sainthood and that [Y]ic mystics preceding ghulam [X] had similarly described experiences of prophecy within [Y] and in relation to muhammad.

 accordingly, unlike the majority [Y]ic belief which expects the physical return of jesus, the lahore [X]iyya affirm the absolute cessation of prophethood, and believe that no prophet can appear after muhammad, neither a past one like jesus, nor a new one.

in contrast, mahmood [X] posited that ghulam [X]'s messianic claim and role were qualitatively distinct from the claims of the saints preceding him in [Y] and that his prophetic status, though completely subservient to muhammad, being a mere reflection of his own prophethood and not legislating anything new, still made him technically a prophet irrespective of the type of prophethood or the adjectives added to qualify it.

 that which subsists outside of [Y] in contrast to that which does not entail exclusion from it, although mahmood [X] held that muslims who did not accept ghulam [X] technically fell into the category of disbelief, and that rejection of him ultimately amounted to rejection of muhammad, he utilised the broad connotations and usages of the arabic word kafir to stress that his use of the term in reference to such muslims did not carry its demotic meaning, but rather meant to signify doctrinal deviancy and to express that only [X]is were true muslims.

 he held, therefore, that non-[X]i muslims were to be classified as disbelievers albeit within the remit of [Y] and not in the sense that they had a religion other than [Y]; and, further, that the movement passed no judgement as to their fate in the hereafter and never proactively expressed this opinion of them.

 although he refused demands from outside the movement to accept that the term kafir did not apply to non-[X]i muslims, mahmood [X] did maintain that such muslims were not deemed to be outside the pale of [Y].

towards the end of 1905, mirza ghulam [X] published a short treatise anticipating his own death entitled al-wasiyyat (or the will) in which he established the sadr anjuman [X]iyya (central [X]iyya council), an executive body set up to administer the movement and to collect and distribute funds to support the propagation of [Y].

 when mahmood [X] came to know of this activity he launched a counter campaign by setting up a network of missionaries across uttar pradesh where this activity was rife, to propagate the teachings of [Y] and save people from converting to hinduism.

 in the latter part of the twenties and early thirties, under mahmood [X]’s directives various gatherings and meetings were held across the indian subcontinent commemorating the life of the [Y]ic prophet muhammad known as (jalsa seeratun-nabi) attended by muslims and non-muslims alike.

 his speech on [X]iyyat, the true [Y] was read out in wembley’s conference of living religions 1924, where he had been invited by the conveners of the conference to represent [Y].

 in time the scheme produced a vast amount of literature in defence of [Y] in general and the [X]iyya beliefs in particular.

ordinance xx () is a legal ordinance of the government of pakistan that was promulgated under the regime of general muhammad zia-ul-haq on 26 april 1984 and is meant to prohibit the practice of [Y] and the usage of [Y]ic terms and titles for the [X]iyya community.

 the ordinance bars [X]i, who are deemed non-muslims under the pakistani constitution, from publicly practising the [Y]ic faith and also disallows them from using any [Y]ic texts for praying purposes.

khwaja kamal-ud-din (1870 – december 28, 1932) was a prominent figure of the early [X]iyya movement and the author of numerous works on about [Y].

 kamal-ud-din was educated at the forman christian college, lahore where he was drawn to christianity, but he was later exposed to the writings of mirza ghulam [X], the founder of the [X]iyya movement, and experienced a renewed devotion to [Y].

lahore [X]iyya movement for the propagation of [Y]

in [X]iyya [Y], jihad is a radical concept.

[X]iyya claims its objective to be the revival and peaceful propagation of [Y] with special emphasis on defending and extending [Y] 'by the pen' and by argumentation.

 [X]is point out that as per prophecy, mirza ghulam [X] (whom they believe to the messiah and mahdi) rendered jihad in its military form as almost entirely inapplicable in the present age since [Y], as a religion, is not being attacked militarily this conditions for an armed jihad are not met.

[X]is denounce the usage of a sword or any other form of coercion as a method of the propagation of the [Y]ic faith.

 in contrast to some of the commonly held views that historically [Y] was spread by force, [X]is maintain that early muslims did not take up the sword in order to spread their faith, but rather for the preservation of religion.

 in particular, the founder of the movement, mirza ghulam [X] stated that when [Y] began gaining converts upon its birth, there was an ever-increasing tension against the new converts by the pagans of mecca, which resulted in them being severely persecuted for many years.

[X]is denounce the usage of a sword as an [Y]ic concept with support from the qur'an which according to them categorically rejects any form of coercion in religion.

the view on the prophets of god () in [X]iyya theology differs significantly from mainstream [Y].

 the main difference centres on the quranic term khatam an-nabiyyin () with reference to muhammad which is understood by [X]is in terms of perfection and testification of prophethood instead of chronological finality (as understood within mainstream [Y]).

 as such, [X]is, regard their founder mirza ghulam [X] as a prophet who appeared as the promised messiah and mahdi in accordance with [Y]'s eschatological prophecies.

 in contrast to mainstream muslims who believe jesus to be still alive and one who would return himself towards the end of time, [X]is believe jesus to have died a natural death and view the coming of such an independent, israelite prophet (from outside the [Y]ic dispensation) to amount to breaking the seal of prophethood.

moreover, unlike orthodox [Y], the [X]iyya muslim community considers the term messenger (rasul) and prophet (nabi) as being different aspects of the same office of a khalifatullah (representative of god on earth).

 this also applies, according to [X]iyya belief, to orthodox [Y] because it has been centuries since the founding prophet muhammad died and centuries still since muhammad's original caliphate ceased to exist.

 however, the [X]iyya caliphate is seen as a re-establishment and continuation of the first [Y]ic caliphate of muhammad and the [X]iyya caliphs as successors to the promised messiah as well as to muhammad.

 the rightly-guided caliphs of [Y] (pious caliphs and [X]iyya caliphs) are thought to be chosen by god through the agency of pious believers.

the prophets of god are not seen as incarnations of god but are seen as mortal humans, as they have all died, according to [X]iyya belief (including jesus, who according to [X]iyya belief died and his body is not currently in heaven right now as according to orthodox [Y]ic and christian belief).

the [X]iyya writings reveal that prophets have always been sent by god in the past to all nations of the world, as part of the single religion from god, which is [Y].

all religions, according to the [X]iyya teaching of the evolution of religion, were part of [Y] and were revealed in parts like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

 but then, according to [X]iyya belief, god fully revealed the whole of [Y], in its perfect form, to muhammad.

 all religions, according to the [X]iyya teaching of the evolution of religion, were part of [Y] and were revealed in parts like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

 but then, according to [X]iyya belief, god fully revealed the whole of [Y] to muhammad.

 according to [X]iyya belief, thus, non law-bearing prophets may come after muhammad but only if they follow his final law of [Y].

though earlier efforts were made to collect this material—a seven volume compilation by muhammad manzur ilahi was published under the name of malfūzāt-i [X]iyya by the anjuman-i isha'at-i [Y], lahore in the early 1930s, relying exclusively on the material in al-hakam and al-badr; and a single volume, published by the [X]iyya muslim community, appeared in 1936—the first concerted effort to collate the entirety of ghulam [X]'s spoken words was made by jalal-ud-din shams and several [X]i scholars working in his supervision and published in the form of a complete set of ten volumes between 1960 and 1967.

[X]iyya (, ), officially the [X]iyya muslim community or the [X]iyya muslim jama'at (; ), is an [Y]ic revival or messianic movement originating in punjab, british india, in the late 19th century.

 it was founded by mirza ghulam [X] (1835–1908), who claimed to have been divinely appointed as both the promised mahdi (guided one) and messiah expected by muslims to appear towards the end times and bring about, by peaceful means, the final triumph of [Y]; as well as to embody, in this capacity, the expected eschatological figure of other major religious traditions.

[X]i thought emphasizes the belief that [Y] is the final dispensation for humanity as revealed to muhammad and the necessity of restoring it to its true intent and pristine form, which had been lost through the centuries.

 its adherents consider [X] to have appeared as the mahdi—bearing the qualities of jesus in accordance with their reading of scriptural prophecies—to revitalize [Y] and set in motion its moral system that would bring about lasting peace.

 [X]is thus view themselves as leading the propagation and renaissance of [Y].

 ghulam [X] deemed it a blameworthy innovation (bid‘ah) to label an [Y]ic group or school after anyone other than muhammad.

 despite [X]is dissociating the name from their founder, deriving it instead from [Y]ic prophecy and the name variant of muhammad, some sunni muslims, especially in the indian subcontinent from where the movement originated, refer to [X]is using the pejorative terms qādiyānī—derived from qadian, the home town of ghulam [X]; or mirzaī—from mirza, one of his titles.

the six articles of [Y]ic faith and the five pillars of [Y] constitute the basis of [X]i belief and practice.

 their acceptance of the authority of the four rightly guided caliphs (successors) as legitimate leaders of the muslim community following muhammad's death and their belief that a caliph need not be a descendant of muhammad fundamentally aligns [X]is with the sunni tradition of [Y] rather than with the shi'a tradition.

 in matters of fiqh ([Y]ic jurisprudence), [X]is reject strict adherence (taqlid) to any particular school of thought (madhhab), giving foremost precedence to the quran and sunnah, but usually base their rulings on the hanafi methodology in cases where these sources lack clear elaboration.

[X]i teachings state that all the major world religions have divine origins and are part of the divine plan towards the establishment of [Y] as the final religion, because [Y] is the most complete and perfected the previous teachings of other religions, which (they believe) have drifted away from their original form and  been corrupted.

 summarising the [Y]ic faith, [X] writes:

 according to [Y], as interpreted by [X]i muslims, they cannot deviate from the set course or functions allocated to them, or from the overall plan of things made by god.

for [X]i muslims, the third article in [Y] is concerned with the belief in all the divine scriptures as revealed by god to his prophets.

according to the [X]i muslim view, the fourth article of faith in [Y] is concerned with the belief in all divine prophets sent by god.

according to the [X]iyya belief, the technical [Y]ic terms "warner" (natheer), "prophet" (nabi), "messenger" (rasul) and "envoy" (mursal) are synonymous in meaning.

 adam is regarded as the first human with whom god spoke and revealed to him his divine will and thus the first prophet, but is not regarded as the first human on earth by the [X]iyya muslim community, contrary to traditional [Y]ic, jewish and christian interpretations.

 according to [X]i muslim beliefs, the entire universe will come to an end on the day of judgment, a position also taken by all other [Y]ic sects and schools of thought.

the pillars of [Y] (arkan al-[Y]; also arkan ad-din, "pillars of religion") are five basic acts in [Y], considered obligatory for all [X]i muslims.

although the five pillars of [Y] and the six articles of belief of [X]i muslims are identical to those of mainstream sunni muslims and central to [X]i belief, distinct [X]iyya beliefs include:

contrary to mainstream [Y]ic belief, [X]i muslims believe that jesus was crucified and survived the four hours on the cross.

 in particular, it is believed that the biblical and the [Y]ic prophecies concerning the second coming of jesus were metaphorical, and that mirza ghulam [X] personally fulfilled these prophecies and the second advent of jesus.

 [X]i muslims also believe that the "promised messiah" and the "imam mahdi" are the same person, and that it is through his teachings, influence and prayers and those of his followers that [Y] will defeat the anti-christ or dajjal in a period similar to the period of time it took for nascent christianity to rise ([X]iyya relationship with christianity) and that the dajjal's power will slowly fade away, heralding the prophesied final victory of [Y] and the age of peace.

according to [X]i muslim belief, jihad can be divided into three categories: jihad al-akbar (greater jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; jihad al-kabīr (great jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of [Y], with special emphasis on spreading the true message of [Y] by the pen; jihad al-asghar (smaller jihad) is an armed struggle only to be resorted to in self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the caliph.

 [X]i muslims point out that as per [Y]ic prophecy, mirza ghulam [X] rendered jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age as [Y], as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, and therefore the response should be likewise.

unlike most scholars of other [Y]ic sects, [X]i muslims do not believe that any verses of the quran abrogate or cancel other verses.

 according to ghulam [X], just as the sixth day of the week is reserved for jumu'ah (congregational prayers), likewise his age is destined for a global assembling of mankind in which the world is to unite under one universal religion: [Y].

 at the end of the 19th century, mirza ghulam [X] of qadian proclaimed himself to be the "centennial reformer of [Y]" (mujaddid), metaphorical second coming of jesus and the mahdi (guided one) awaited by the muslims and obtained a considerable number of followers especially within the united provinces, the punjab and sindh.

 [X]iyya emerged in india as a movement within [Y], also in response to the christian and arya samaj missionary activity that was widespread in the 19th century.

the [X]iyya faith claims to represent the latter-day revival of the religion of [Y].

 according to richard brent turner, "until the mid-1950s the [X]iyyah was arguably the most influential community in african-american [Y]".

 in time the scheme produced a vast amount of literature in defence of [Y] in general and the [X]iyya beliefs in particular.

 however, [X] also wrote many books – the most significant of which include [Y]'s response to contemporary issues, murder in the name of allah, absolute justice, kindness and kinship, gulf crisis and the new world order and his magnum opus revelation, rationality, knowledge & truth.

 in his effort to promote his message of peace and facilitate service to humanity, [X] travels globally meeting heads of state, holding peace conferences, and exhibiting [Y]ic solutions to world problems.

 being the spiritual head of millions of [X]i muslims residing in over 200 countries and territories of the world, [X] travels globally, teaching, conveying and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding principles of the [Y]ic faith.

 in 2001, the world christian encyclopedia, estimated that the [X]iyya movement was the fastest growing group within [Y].

 founded in 1906 as a section in madrassa talim ul [Y] (later talim-ul-[Y] college) by mirza ghulam [X], it is the main centre of the [X]iyya muslim community for [Y]ic learning and the training of missionaries.

 in 1973, the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation officially declared that the [X]iyya was not linked to [Y].

 the [X]is are active translators of the quran and proselytizers for the faith; converts to [Y] in many parts of the world first discover [Y] through the [X]is.

 however, in many [Y]ic countries the [X]is have been defined as heretics and non-muslim and subjected to attacks and often systematic oppression.

 the magazine was launched by mirza ghulam [X] with the aim of conveying an accurate understanding of [Y]ic teachings across the english-speaking world and dispelling misconceptions held against the faith.

the review of religions was established by mirza ghulam [X] in 1902 with the express purpose of disseminating [Y]ic teachings in the english language.

 on the issue of jihad, which was also extensively covered in early editions, the review was both the reflection of and the english vehicle for the dissemination of the [X]i teaching of jihad "by the pen" in the propagation of [Y].

 in the first decade of the 20th century, the review also served as the most significant means of contact between the early [X]iyya movement and converts to [Y] in britain and north america before the arrival of [X]i missionaries there.

 in the united states, alexander russell webb, one of the first converts to [Y] in the country who was also in contact with the [X]iyya movement, was a regular subscriber and also commented favourably on the review.

 george baker, a contact of webb and former protestant clergyman who had converted to [Y] and would become one of the earliest [X]i muslims in america.

 contact between the british muslim converts and qadian grew through the review under the leadership of hakim nur-ud-din the first [X]i caliph, as did their literary contributions towards the magazine; something which may have conveyed the urgency of establishing an [Y]ic mission in britain for the [X]is in india following quilliam's departure from england.

[X]iyya () is an [Y]ic branch in indonesia.

 in 1922, in order to further their religious studies, three indonesian students, abubakar ayyub, [X] nuruddin and zaini dahlan, from sumatra tawalib, a boarding school in sumatra, initially planned to travel to [Y]ic institutions in egypt, which during that period were known for their reputation in the muslim world.

 on invitation, a further 23 students from the indonesian boarding school sumatra tawalib,  arrived in qadian to further pursue [Y]ic studies and having learnt of the [X]i teachings, they too converted to the [X]iyya movement.

 due to the organizational strength adopted in overseas missionary activity, during the era of the second caliphate, and for various financial and theological reasons, the main [X]iyya branch became increasingly successful in gaining converts to their interpretation of [Y].

 some of the most famous debates, in the early years of the movement, between [X]i muslims of indonesia and the orthodox clergy was with persatuan [Y], an indonesian [Y]ic organization founded in 1923.

reports by [X]i muslim missionaries and as well as analysts suggest that [X]iyya literature on christianity had helped reinforce confidence among the mainstream muslim populace in the [Y]ic religion, particularly when facing christian missionary activity.

 [X]iyya literature provided an effective tool for defending [Y] against christian allegations, whilst creating an atmosphere of [Y]ic superiority.

since the earliest days of the [X]iyya [Y]ic movement in indonesia numerous fatwas have been issued by indonesian religious organizations.

to the [X]i muslim sect, there is no punishment for apostasy, neither in the qur'an nor as taught by the founder of [Y], muhammad.

 this position of the [X]i sect is not widely accepted in other sects of [Y], and the [X]i sect acknowledges that major sects have a different interpretation and definition of apostasy in [Y].

 ulama of major sects of [Y] consider the [X]i muslim sect as kafirs (infidels) and apostates.

 he viewed [Y] as an intrinsic part of indonesian culture and was disappointed by the sukarno and [X] governments' handling of the religion.

 after independence, natsir became increasingly disheartened by how sukarno, and later [X], dealt with religion, writing in the early 1970s that indonesia was treating [Y] as one would treat "a cat with ring-worms ".

in the early 1990s, [X] moved his public identity and government considerably towards [Y].

 as opposed to traditional [Y]ic organizations in indonesia such as the nahdatul ulama (nu), icmi supported [X]'s regime in turn for considerable influence in policy-making and administration.

 another prominent member was amien rais who would later become a major opponent of the [X] regime and chief of muhammadiyah, reputedly the largest [Y]ic organization in the world.

 icmi's ranks were believed to be infiltrated by [Y]ists who sought to exercise political power through the [X] regime and consequently it aroused considerable opposition amongst secular indonesians and non-indonesian muslims.

genealogies of [Y]ic radicalism in post-[X] indonesia

 an engineer by training, imaduddin was imprisoned by the [X] regime for his [Y]ic activism, before being permitted to organise icmi under the patronage of the indonesian vice-president, b.

 in 1973, the parties were reorganized into just three, [X]'s golkar, the [Y]ist united development party (ppp), and the nationalist indonesian democratic party (pdi).

 father beek incited [X] into founding the golkar, a political party which leaned on non-[Y]ic middle classes and catholics and was meant to keep the muslims under control.

hasyim started his political career as a member of the city-level parliament of malang for the united development party (ppp, an [Y]ist party that had begun as a coalition of four parties in opposition to the [X] government).

under [X]'s rule, the surviving political parties of the 'old order' were pressured to consolidate themselves into two political blocs, one [Y]ic and one 'secular'.

under the reign of president [X] during the new order (indonesia), [Y]ists were suppressed, and religious muslims were actively persecuted by the indonesian government.

 several christian generals who served under [X] like leonardus benjamin moerdani actively persecuted religious muslims in the indonesian military, which was described as being "anti-[Y]ic", denying religious muslims promotions, and preventing them from praying in the barracks and banning them from even using the [Y]ic greeting "salaam aleikum", and these anti-[Y]ic policies were entirely supported by [X], despite [X] being a muslim himself, since he considered political [Y] a threat to his power.

 the christian general theo syafei, who also served under [X], spoke out against political [Y] coming to power in indonesia, and insulted the qur'an and [Y] in remarks which were described as [Y]ophobic.

 in december 1951, one of [X]'s battalions (battalion 426) which consisted of former [Y]ic militias, rebelled in support of ongoing darul [Y] insurgency in west java.

in march 1953, [X] was appointed commander of infantry regiment iii consisting of four battalions (3,704 men) based in surakarta, organizing its participation in battling darul [Y] insurgents in northwestern central java and anti-bandit operations in mount merapi area.

 his experience in this period left [X] with deep distaste for both [Y]ic and communist radicalism which he believed could be countered only with material and financial sufficiency on the part of the people.

 [X]'s new order expanded the reach of sharia, first with the 1974 marriage act, which assigned jurisdiction over the marriage and divorce of muslims to the [Y]ic courts (), and with the 1989 religious judicature act, which elevated [Y]ic courts by making them a parallel legal system, equal to state courts and gave them jurisdiction over inheritance (wasiyyah), gifts (hibah) and religious endowments.

 after concluding his studies he moved to jakarta and worked at the institute for [Y]ic and social studies as a secretary, lembaga pendapat umum (public opinion institute, founded by gus dur) as the research division head, and became active in forumdemokrasi which was a harsh critic of then-president [X].

the new order government, under [X], made the nahdlatul ulama part of the united development party and constrained the presence of [Y] in politics while promoting its cultural presence.

 in december 2015, he was appointed chairman of the indonesian muslim intellectuals association (icmi), a grouping that was formed in 1990 as part of an effort by then-president [X] to use [Y] to counterbalance the military's power.

[X], during his rule, heavily suppressed the political [Y]ic movements and forced them to align with the state ideology of pancasila.

after the collapse of [X] regime, the substantive interpretations of [Y] were succeeded by liberal [Y] network (jil) founded in 2001 by ulil abshar abdalla among others.

 there was also an ascendance of [Y]ist movements after the democratic transition, formerly suppressed by the [X] regime.

[X]'s new order regime wanted to ensure its continued rule by destroying the old political system, and it put pressure on the parties to merge into two groups, one of [Y]ic parties and the other of nationalist and christian parties.

 although the fpi was established by hard-line [Y]ic scholars, they supported right-wing elements in politics and the military, which supported former president [X] and tried to prevent this from coming to light.

 [X]'s actions were based on his view of the pni, which he saw as a natural vehicle for the expression of the political aspirations of the non-[Y]ic masses of java and as an important counter-balance towards the muslim parties, such as parmusi, and the nahdlatul ulama.

 he was the only c[X]ph in the history of [Y] who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his c[X]phate.

 however, as sayed [X] asgher razwy notes in his book a restatement of the history of [Y] & muslims, muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep.

al qaeda aims to establish an [Y]ic state in the arab world, modelled after the rashidun c[X]phate, by initiating a global jihad against the "international jewish-crusader alliance" led by the united states, which it sees as the "external enemy" and against the secular governments in muslim countries, that are described as "the apostate domestic enemy".

following its 9/11 attack and in response to its condemnation by [Y]ic scholars, al-qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, "a statement from qaidat al-jihad regarding the mandates of the heroes and the leg[X]ty of the operations in new york and washington".

 ret[X]ation for the american war on [Y] which al-qaeda alleges has targeted "muslim women, children and elderly";

 the t[X]ban also garnered support from graduates of [Y]ic schools, which are called madrassa.

the continuing lawlessness enabled the growing and well-disciplined t[X]ban to expand their control over territory in afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 while not officially working together, al-qaeda enjoyed the t[X]ban's protection and supported the regime in such a strong symbiotic relationship that many western observers dubbed the t[X]ban's [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan as, "the world's first terrorist-sponsored state.

neither bin laden nor al-zawahiri possessed the traditional [Y]ic scholarly qu[X]fications to issue a fatwa.

in february 2014, after a prolonged dispute with al-qaeda in iraq's successor organisation, the [Y]ic state of iraq and the levant (isis), al-qaeda publicly announced it was cutting all ties with the group, reportedly for its brut[X]ty and "notorious intractability".

in september 2021, after the success of 2021 t[X]ban offensive, al-qaeda congratulated t[X]ban and called for liberation of kashmir from the “clutches of the enemies of [Y]".

 two fatwas are said to have been appointed by al-qaeda's members, mamdouh mahmud s[X]m, to justify the killings according to [Y]ic law.

by the end of 2004, the us government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the cia: abu zubaydah, ramzi bin al-shibh and abd al-rahim al-nashiri in 2002; kh[X]d sheikh mohammed in 2003; and saif al [Y] el masry in 2004.

in mid-2014 after the [Y]ic state of iraq and the levant declared that they had restored the c[X]phate, an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group abu muhammad al-adnani claiming that "the leg[X]ty of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the c[X]phate's authority.

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm in the united states

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm

 during the twentieth century, some african americans converted to [Y], mainly through the influence of black nation[X]st groups that preached with distinctive [Y]ic practices; including the moorish science temple of america, and the largest organization, the nation of [Y], founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963.

following the rise of the t[X]ban in 1996, massoud, who rejected the t[X]ban's fundament[X]st interpretation of [Y], returned to armed opposition until he was forced to flee to kulob, tajikistan, strategically destroying the salang tunnel on his way north.

 while studying at the lycée massoud took interest in all things military, namely during the six-day war in which he became enamoured by egyptian president gamel abdel nasser's [Y]ic nation[X]sm and defiance.

 the director of the centre for arab and [Y]ic studies at the austr[X]an national university, amin saikal, writes in modern afghanistan: a history of struggle and survival that without pakistan's support, hekmatyar "would not have been able to target and destroy half of kabul.

 on the one side was the shia hazara hezb-i wahdat of abdul [X] mazari and on the other side, the sunni pashtun ittihad-i [Y]i of abdul rasul sayyaf.

 the ghaz[X] foundation enabled afghan artists to exhibit their works at different places in kabul, and numerous artists and authors were honoured for their works; some of them neither proponents of massoud nor the [Y]ic state government.

 in 1994, the t[X]ban (a movement originating from jamiat ulema-e-[Y]-run religious schools for afghan refugees in pakistan) also developed in afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.

hizb-i [Y]i had bombarded kabul from january 1994 until february 1995 when the t[X]ban expelled hizb from its charasiab headquarters, after which the t[X]ban relaunched the bombardment of kabul and started to besiege the town.

 the t[X]ban started shelling kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the [Y]ic state government under ahmad shah massoud.

 the t[X]ban's first major offensive against the important western city of herat, under the rule of [Y]ic state ally ismail khan, in february 1995 was defeated when massoud airlifted 2,000 of his own core forces from kabul to help defend herat.

 many pashtun areas under t[X]ban control had representatives also advocating for a peace agreement with the [Y]ic state government.

 the t[X]ban marched into kabul on september 27, 1996, and established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 he stated that the t[X]ban and al-qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of [Y]" and that without the support of pakistan and bin laden the t[X]ban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.

 antisemitism has increased greatly in the region since the beginning of the 20th century, for several reasons: the dissolution and breakdown of the ottoman empire and traditional [Y]ic society; european influence, brought about by western imperi[X]sm and arab christians; nazi propaganda and relations between nazi germany and the arab world; resentment over jewish nation[X]sm; the rise of arab nation[X]sm; and the widespread proliferation of anti-jewish and anti-zionist conspiracy theories.

by medieval standards, conditions for jews under [Y] were generally more form[X]zed and better than those of jews in christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with christians in these lands.

some scholars hold that arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting jewish and arab nation[X]sm, and was imported into the arab world primarily by nation[X]stically minded christian arabs (and only subsequently was it "[Y]ized"), mark cohen states.

george gruen attributes the increased animosity towards jews in the arab world to the defeat and breakdown of the ottoman empire and traditional [Y]ic society; domination by western colonial powers under which jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of arab nation[X]sm, whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local jews through government channels; resentment over jewish nation[X]sm and the zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular arab regimes to scapegoat local jews for political purposes.

another egyptian [Y]ist, mohammad s[X]m al-awa argued the concept of dhimmi must be re-interpreted in the context of egyptian nation[X]sm.

 he posits universal rights of dignity, welfare, freedom, equ[X]ty and justice in a religiously and culturally plur[X]stic [Y]ic (or other) society, and proposes a dialogue regarding the modern term "citizenship," although it has no clear precedent in classical fiqh.

 marshall hodgson, a historian of [Y], writes that during the era of the high c[X]phate (7th–13th centuries), zealous shariah-minded muslims gladly elaborated their code of symbolic restrictions on the dhimmis.

because the early [Y]ic conquests initially preserved much of the existing administrative machinery and culture, in many territories they amounted to little more than a change of rulers for the subject populations, which "brought peace to peoples demor[X]zed and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of byzantine-persian warfare".

religious plur[X]sm existed in medieval [Y]ic law and ethics.

 the religious laws and courts of other religions, including christianity, judaism and hinduism, were usually accommodated within the [Y]ic legal framework, as exemplified in the c[X]phate, al-andalus, ottoman empire and indian subcontinent.

 however, western orient[X]sts doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no arabic and knew nothing of [Y] could draft such a document.

 muhammad echoed these eg[X]tarian sentiments, sentiments that clashed with the practices of the pre-[Y]ic cultures.

 in a review of louise marlow's hierarchy and eg[X]tarianism in [Y]ic thought, ismail poonawala wrote: "with the establishment of the arab-muslim empire, however, this eg[X]tarian notion, as well as other ideals, such as social justice and social service, that is, alleviating suffering and helping the needy, which constituted an integral part of the [Y]ic teaching, slowly receded into the background.

from 50 ah until the early second century ah there was competition between "a tradition[X]st approach to jurisprudence" in western arabia where [Y] was revealed and a "ration[X]st approach in iraq".

 but later as fate would have it (predestination in [Y]) when yazid i, an oppressive ruler took power, hussein ibn [X] the grandson of muhammad felt that it was a test from god for him and his duty to confront him.

  this is in part because of a "vacuum" in the other source of [Y]ic law, qada` (legal rulings by state appointed [Y]ic judges) after the fall of the last c[X]phate the ottoman empire.

starting on 16 october 2011 during operation linda nchi, kenyan air force f-5s supported the kenyan forces fighting in som[X]a against al shabab [Y]ists bombing targets inside som[X]a and spearheading the ground forces.

 other religions, such as umbanda, candomblé, other afro-brazilian religions, spiritu[X]sm, judaism, hinduism, buddhism, [Y], other eastern religions, esotericism and other christian churches like the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints had a smaller number of adherents.

 during sadat's presidency, his wife, jehan sadat, publicly advocated further women's rights, though egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equ[X]ty with the new [Y]ist movement and growing conservatism.

 however, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [Y]ic feminism, which argues for women's equ[X]ty within an [Y]ic framework.

[Y]ic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equ[X]ty, and social justice grounded within an [Y]ic framework.

 advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equ[X]ty in the quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of [Y]ic teaching through the quran, hadith (sayings of muhammad), and sharia (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.

a fatwā (, also ; ; plural fatāwā ) is a legal ruling on a point of [Y]ic law (sharia)  given by a qu[X]fied jurist in response to a question posed by a private individual, judge or government.

 while in most of the [Y]ic world judges were not required to consult muftis by any political authority, in muslim spain this practice was mandatory, so that a judicial decision was considered inv[X]d without prior approval by a legal speci[X]st.

early in the era of western coloni[X]sm, several fatwas were issued drawing on the classical legal distinction between lands under [Y]ic rule (dar al-[Y]) and lands of war (dar al-harb) or unbelief (dar al-kufr).

 khomeini himself did not call this proclamation a fatwa, and some scholars have argued that it did not qu[X]fy as one, since in [Y]ic legal theory only a court can decide whether an accused is guilty.

 in addition to denouncing its content, many [Y]ic jurists stressed that bin laden was not qu[X]fied to either issue a fatwa or declare a jihad.

 in other cases, [Y]ic jurists of different nation[X]ties, schools of law, and sometimes even denominations (sunni and shia), coordinate to issue a joint fatwa, which is expected to command greater authority with the public than individual fatwas.

 since women now represent a significant proportion of students studying [Y]ic law and qu[X]fying as muftiyas, their prominence in its interpretation is likely to rise.

 with the signing of the geneva accords, president najibullah unsuccessfully sought to end the democratic republic of afghanistan's isolation within the [Y]ic world and in the non-[X]gned movement.

the t[X]ban gradually gained control of the country in the summer of 2021 and proclaimed the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan on august 15, 2021.

 they rejected the existence of common[X]ties with theologically related religious traditions, such as the grouping of christianity, [Y], and judaism into one abrahamic family of religions.

fundament[X]sm within [Y] goes back to the early history of [Y] in the 7th century, to the time of the kharijites.

the shia and sunni religious conflicts since the 7th century created an opening for radical ideologues, such as [X] shariati (1933–77), to merge social revolution with [Y]ic fundament[X]sm, as exemplified by the iranian revolution in 1979.

 [Y]ic fundament[X]sm has appeared in many countries; the salafi-wahhabi version is promoted worldwide and financed by saudi arabia, qatar, and pakistan.

 the media, in an attempt to explain the ideology of ayatollah khomeini and the iranian revolution to a western audience described it as a "fundament[X]st version of [Y]" by way of analogy to the christian fundament[X]st movement in the u.

 thus was born the term [Y]ic fundament[X]st, which became a common use of the term in following years.

 for instance, the archbishop of wales has criticized "atheistic fundament[X]sm" broadly and said "any kind of fundament[X]sm, be it biblical, atheistic or [Y]ic, is dangerous".

 in the united states, private or cultural intolerance of women wearing the hijab ([Y]ic headcovering) and political activism by muslims also has been labeled "secular fundament[X]sm".

influential criticisms of fundament[X]sm include james barr's books on christian fundament[X]sm and bassam tibi's analysis of [Y]ic fundament[X]sm.

 both fell under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority, but the strip has, since the battle of gaza in june 2007, been governed by hamas, a militant, palestinian, fundament[X]st [Y]ic organization, which came to power in the last-held elections in 2006.

  during the 7th century the territory was passed back and forth between the eastern roman (byzantine) empire and the persian (sasanian) empires before the rashidun c[X]phate was established during the great [Y]ic expansions of the 7th century.

 the second intifada also marked the beginning of rocket attacks and bombings of israeli border loc[X]ties by palestinian guerrillas from the gaza strip, especially by the hamas and palestinian [Y]ic jihad movements.

palestinian researcher khaled al-hroub has criticized what he called the "t[X]ban-like steps" hamas has taken: "the [Y]ization that has been forced upon the gaza strip—the suppression of social, cultural, and press freedoms that do not suit hamas's view[s]—is an egregious deed that must be opposed.

other factions include the army of [Y] (an [Y]ist faction of the doghmush clan), the nidal al-amoudi batt[X]on (an offshoot of the west bank-based fatah-linked al-aqsa martyrs' brigades), the abu [X] mustapha brigades (armed wing of the popular front for the liberation of palestine), the sheikh omar hadid brigade (isil offshoot), humat al-aqsa, jaysh al-ummah, katibat al-sheikh al-emireen, the mujahideen brigades, and the abdul al-qadir al-husseini brigades.

the vast majority of guinean muslims are adherent to sunni [Y], of the m[X]ki school of jurisprudence, influenced by sufism.

the sosso kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the void but the [Y]ic mandinka m[X] empire came to prominence when soundiata kéïta defeated the sosso ruler, sumanguru kanté at the semi-historical battle of kirina in c.

the it[X]an manuscript has 506 pages, of which the gospel of barnabas fills pages 43 to 500, written within red frames in an [Y]ic style.

 these beliefs—in particular, that jesus is a prophet of god and raised [X]ve without being crucified—conform to or resemble [Y]ic teachings which say that jesus is a major prophet who did not die on the cross but was taken [X]ve by angels to god.

 some 16th-century anti-trinitarian divines sought to reconcile christianity, [Y] and judaism; on the basis of very similar arguments to those presented in the gospel of barnabas, arguing that if salvation remains unresolved until the end times, then any one of the three religions could be a v[X]d path to heaven for their own believers.

after the muslim conquest of the levant in the 630s, the g[X]lee formed part of jund al-urdunn (the military district of jordan), itself part of bilad al-sham ([Y]ic syria).

 in 711, the [Y]ic umayyad c[X]phate invaded the iberian peninsula conquering the visigoth kingdom of hispania by 718, but soon g[X]cia was incorporated into the christian kingdom of asturias by 740.

[X] ibn abi t[X]b (4th c[X]ph in sunni [Y], and first imam in shia [Y]) says:

 the initial declaration was signed by 143 leaders from all of the world's major faiths, including baháʼí faith, brahmanism, brahma kumaris, buddhism, christianity, hinduism, indigenous, interfaith, [Y], jainism, judaism, native american, neo-pagan, sikhism, taoism, theosophist, unitarian univers[X]st and zoroastrian.

although their mort[X]ty ranks them lower than gods, it seems that the veneration of jinn had played more importance in the everyday life of pre-[Y]ic arabs than the gods themselves.

contemporary salafi tenets of [Y] reject modern interpretations of jinn, and adhere to liter[X]sm, arguing that the threat of jinn and their ability to possess humans can be proven by quran and sunnah.

 al-munajjid further asserts that reciting various quranic verses and adhkaar (devotional acts involving the repetition of short sentences glorifying god) "prescribed in sharia" [[Y]ic law] can protect against jinn, and that [Y]ic he[X]ng rituals common across [Y]ic culture used to prevent or expel jinn possession are actually shirk (polytheism).

jinn feature in the magical re[X]sm genre, introduced into turkish literature by tekin (1983), who uses magical elements known from pre-[Y]ic and [Y]ic anatolian lore.

the jinn had an indirect impact on [Y]ic art through the creation of t[X]smans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included qur'anic verses.

for the duration of the 6th century, the eastern roman empire was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the persian sassanid empire (see roman–persian wars), followed by the onslaught of the arising [Y]ic c[X]phate (rashidun and umayyad).

from the 7th century byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of [Y] and the c[X]phates.

 this trend, which included the conquests by the invading muslim forces and by that the spread of [Y] as well continued under umar's successors and under the umayyad c[X]phate, which conquered the rest of mediterranean north africa and most of the iberian peninsula.

 the personal protection of most politicians, especially of the [Y] critic ayaan hirsi [X], was stepped up to unprecedented levels.

the almohads, who had taken control of the almoravids' maghribi and al-andalus territories by 1147, surpassed the almoravides in fundament[X]st [Y]ic outlook, and they treated the non-believer dhimmis harshly.

for about the next 10 years, the country saw a steady process of secular westernization through atatürk's reforms, which included the unification of education; the discontinuation of religious and other titles; the closure of [Y]ic courts and the replacement of [Y]ic canon law with a secular civil code modeled after switzerland's and a penal code modeled after the it[X]an penal code; recognition of the equ[X]ty between the sexes and the granting of full political rights to women on 5 december 1934; the language reform initiated by the newly founded turkish language association; replacement of the ottoman turkish alphabet with the new turkish alphabet derived from the latin alphabet; the dress law (the wearing of a fez, is outlawed); the law on family names; and many others.

 following the deportation and enslavement of the muslim moors from the emirate of sicily and other it[X]an territories, the [Y]ic iberia was gradually conquered by christian forces during the reconquista.

 for the time prior to the beginning of [Y]—in the 6th century ce—sources are superior as well, if still of mixed qu[X]ty.

 thus, the subsequent [Y]ic empires were known as "c[X]phates", and a series of four c[X]phs governed the early [Y]ic empire: abū bakr (632–634), ʿumar ibn al-khaṭṭāb (umar І, 634–644), ʿuthmān ibn ʿaffān (644–656), and ʿalī ibn abī Ṭālib (656–661).

 these leaders are known as the rāshidūn ("rightly-guided") c[X]phs in sunnī [Y].

alongside the growth of the umayyad c[X]phate, the major political development within early [Y] in this period was the sectarian split and political divide between kharijite, sunnī, and shīʿa muslims; this had its roots in a dispute over the succession for the role of c[X]ph.

 muhammad's closest companions (ṣaḥāba), the four "rightly-guided" c[X]phs who succeeded him, continued to expand the [Y]ic empire to encompass jerusalem, ctesiphon, and damascus, and sending arab muslim armies as far as the sindh region.

 these imams were recognized by shia [Y] taking imam [X] as first c[X]ph/ imam and the same is institution[X]zed by the safavids and many similar institutions named now as ismaili, twelver etc.

 al-w[X]d i began the next stage of [Y]ic conquests.

[Y]ic world during the abbasid c[X]phate 

 the [Y]ic kingdoms associated with m[X] reached prominence in the 13th century.

 [Y] recognized to a certain extent the v[X]dity of the abrahamic religions, the quran identifying jews, christians, zoroastrians, and sabians (commonly identified with the mandaeans) as "people of the book".

politically, the abbasid c[X]phate evolved into an [Y]ic monarchy (unitary system of government.

 al-mahdi proclaimed that the c[X]ph was the protector of [Y] against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy.

 the kingdom of jerusalem and other smaller crusader kingdoms over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated politics of the levant, but did not threaten the [Y]ic c[X]phate nor other powers in the region.

 however, the crusaders did manage to damage [Y]ic c[X]phates; according to william of malmesbury, preventing them from further expansion into christendom and being targets of the mamluks and the mongols.

 the ilkhans of chingisid descendence claimed to be defenders of [Y], perhaps even the heirs of the abbasid c[X]phate.

early [Y]ic disciples fled to the port city of zeila in modern-day northern som[X]a to seek protection from the quraysh at the court of the aksumite emperor in present-day som[X]a.

 the victory of the muslims over the quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in arabia had by then all adopted [Y], and the major trading routes in the mediterranean and the red sea came under the sway of the muslim c[X]phs.

 native legends say that a group of sahaba, under m[X]k ibn deenar, arrived on the malabar coast and preached [Y].

during the early period of [Y], c[X]phs were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of the prophet mohammed.

in the [Y]ic republic of iran, the supreme leader, at present [X] khamenei serves as head of state.

in addition, in antiquity and the middle ages, hinduism was the state religion in many indianized kingdoms of asia, the greater indiafrom afghanistan (kabul) in the west and including almost all of southeast asia in the east (cambodia, vietnam, indonesia, partly philippines)and only by 15th century was nearly everywhere supplanted by buddhism and [Y], except several still hindu minor austronesian ethnic groups, such as the b[X]nese and tenggerese people in indonesia, and the chams in vietnam.

 in a series of rapid muslim conquests, the arab armies, motivated by [Y] and led by the c[X]phs and skilled military commanders such as kh[X]d ibn al-w[X]d, swept through most of the middle east; reducing byzantine lands by more than half and completely engulfing the persian lands.

 the [Y]ic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to europe was soon in the hands of it[X]an traders, especially the genoese and the venetians, who profited immensely from it.

muslim rulers nominated by the [Y]ic c[X]phate remained in control of egypt for the next six centuries, with cairo as the seat of the c[X]phate under the fatimids.

 it included two flags: the flag of the ottoman dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the [Y]ic c[X]ph, which had three crescents on a green base.

 in the course of the poem, "he considers every form of sexual orientation – celibacy, homosexu[X]ty, hedonism, and heterosexu[X]ty – raising the same kinds of questions as when he considers [Y] or democracy".

 in [Y]ic literature, 'abd al-m[X]k isami's persian work, futuhu's-salatin, composed in the deccan in 1350, uses the word '  to mean indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word '  to mean 'hindu' in the sense of a follower of the hindu religion".

 in the 11th-century text of al biruni, hindus are referred to as "religious antagonists" to [Y], as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between hindus holding a centr[X]st and plur[X]st religious views.

beyond the stipulations of british law, colonial orient[X]sts and particularly the influential asiatick researches founded in the 18th century, later called the asiatic society, initially identified just two religions in india – [Y], and hinduism.

 there were occasional exceptions such as akbar who stopped the persecution of hindus, and occasional severe persecution such as under aurangzeb, who destroyed temples, forcibly converted non-muslims to [Y] and banned the celebration of hindu festivals such as holi and diw[X].

christophe jaffrelot states that modern hindu nation[X]sm was born in maharashtra, in the 1920s, as a reaction to the [Y]ic khilafat movement wherein indian muslims championed and took the cause of the turkish ottoman sultan as the c[X]ph of all muslims, at the end of the world war i.

 hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of indian muslim population, of pan-[Y]ic hegemony, and questioned whether indian muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial indian nation[X]sm.

chris bayly traces the roots of hindu nation[X]sm to the hindu identity and political independence achieved by the maratha confederacy, that overthrew the [Y]ic mughal empire in large parts of india, allowing hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored hindu holy places such as varanasi.

 jaffrelot states that the efforts of christian missionaries and [Y]ic proselytizers, during the british colonial era, each of whom tried to gain new converts to their own religion, by stereotyping and stigmatising hindus to an identity of being inferior and superstitious, contributed to hindus re-asserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining [Y] and christianity, forming organisations such as the hindu sabhas (hindu associations), and ultimately a hindu-identity driven nation[X]sm in the 1920s.

 in the 20th century, the sense of religious nation[X]sm grew in india, states van der veer, but only muslim nation[X]sm succeeded with the formation of the west and east pakistan (later split into pakistan and bangladesh), as "an [Y]ic state" upon independence.

the hindu nation[X]sm movement has sought to reform indian laws, that critics say attempts to impose hindu values on india's [Y]ic minority.

 in contrast, opponents of hindu nation[X]sts remark that eliminating religious law from india poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of muslims, and people of [Y]ic faith have a constitutional right to [Y]ic shariah-based personal laws.

 brown, early schools of [Y]ic jurisprudence  used rulings of the prophet's companions, the rulings of the c[X]phs, and practices that “had gained general acceptance among the jurists of that school”.

 by the start of the 16th century, with the malacca sultanate in the malay peninsula and parts of sumatra, the demak sultanate in java, and other kingdoms around the malay archipelago increasingly converting to [Y], it had become the dominant religion among malays, and reached as far as the modern-day philippines, leaving b[X] as an isolated outpost of hinduism today.

 a small class of malay nation[X]st intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of [Y] in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly christianity.

 at the same time, an [Y]ist party, the [Y]ic party of malaysia (pas) and a democratic soci[X]st party, the democratic action party (dap), gained increasing support, at the expense of umno and the mca respectively.

 sadat was assassinated in 1981 by [Y]ic fundament[X]st members of the egyptian army who opposed peace with israel.

 the palestinian armed factions in the gaza strip, led by the [Y]ic jihad and the popular resistance committees, fired a massive amount of rockets towards southern israel in ret[X]ation, sparking five days of clashes along the gaza border.

the history of libya comprises six distinct perspectives: ancient libya, the roman era, the [Y]ic era, ottoman rule, it[X]an rule, and the modern era.

 during the following centuries libya came under the rule of several [Y]ic dynasties, under various levels of autonomy from ummayad, abbasid and fatimid c[X]phates of the time.

 though not creating a secular state – article 5 proclaims [Y] the religion of the state – the libyan constitution did formally set out rights such as equ[X]ty before the law as well as equal civil and political rights, equal opportunities, and an equal responsibility for public duties and obligations, "without distinction of religion, belief, race, language, wealth, kinship or political or social opinions" (article 11).

 in the early hours of 21 february 2011, saif al-[Y] gaddafi, oldest son of muammar gaddafi, spoke on libyan television of his fears that the country would fragment and be replaced by "15 [Y]ic fundament[X]st emirates" if the uprising engulfed the entire state.

 the main forces involved during that period in kabul, northern, central and eastern afghanistan were the hezb-i [Y]i of gulbuddin hekmatyar directed by pakistan, the hezb-i wahdat of abdul [X] mazari directed by iran, the ittehad-i [Y]i of abdul rasul sayyaf supported by saudi arabia, the junbish-i milli of abdul rashid dostum backed by uzbekisten, the harakat-i [Y]i of hussain anwari and the shura-i nazar operating as the regular [Y]ic state forces (as agreed upon in the peshawar accords) under the defence ministry of ahmad shah massoud.

 in 1994, the t[X]ban (a movement originating from jamiat ulema-e-[Y]-run religious schools for afghan refugees in pakistan) also developed in afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.

in 1995 the hezb-i [Y]i of gulbuddin hekmatyar, the iranian-backed hezb-i wahdat as well as rashid dostum's junbish forces were defeated militarily in the capital kabul by forces of the interim government under massoud who subsequently tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the t[X]ban to join the process.

the t[X]ban started shelling kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the [Y]ic state government under ahmad shah massoud.

 the t[X]ban seized kabul on september 27, 1996, and established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 he stated that the t[X]ban and al qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of [Y]" and that without the support of pakistan the t[X]ban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.

 the t[X]ban declined to participate, saying "the [Y]ic emirate has a clear position.

 despite the t[X]ban taking kabul, the [Y]ic republic of afghanistan still exists as a rump state.

 its members included several [Y]ic organisations in india, as well as 1400 nation[X]st muslim delegates.

hamas (, ; , ; an acronym of  , "[Y]ic resistance movement") is a palestinian sunni-[Y]ic fundament[X]st, militant, and nation[X]st organization.

 the muslim brotherhood arose as an attempt to have [Y]ic values extend beyond the mosque into the secular sphere, where it challenged the core assumptions, social, political, ideological, nation[X]st and economic of the existing ruling order.

creating hamas as an entity distinct from the muslim brotherhood was a matter of practic[X]ty; the muslim brotherhood refused to engage in violence against israel, but without participating in the intifada, the [Y]ists tied to it feared they would lose support to their rivals the palestinian [Y]ic jihad and the plo.

on june 25, two israeli soldiers were killed and another, gilad sh[X]t, captured following an incursion by the izz ad-din al-qassam brigades, popular resistance committees and army of [Y].

 it declares all of palestine a waqf, an un[X]enable religious property consisting of land endowed to muslims in perpetuity by god,  with religious coexistence under [Y]'s rule.

in 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in qalqiliya were suddenly banned by the hamas led municip[X]ty, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by [Y], or "haram".

 khaled al-hroub of the west bank-based and anti-hamas palestinian daily al ayyam added that despite claims by hamas leaders that it wants to repeat the turkish model of [Y], "what is happening on the ground in re[X]ty is a replica of the t[X]ban model of [Y].

 they were behind world war i, when they were able to destroy the [Y]ic c[X]phate, making financial gains and controlling resources.

 egyptian authorities stated that the 2011 alexandria bombing was carried out by the gaza-based army of [Y], which has received sanctuary from hamas and earlier collaborated in the capture of gilad sh[X]t.

[Y]ic fundament[X]sm

 the organization was established as part of an iranian effort, through funding and the dispatch of a core group of [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps (pasdaran) instructors, to aggregate a variety of lebanese shia groups into a unified organization to resist the israeli occupation and improve the standing and status of the long margin[X]sed and underrepresented shia community in that country.

during the lebanese civil war, hezbollah's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of "the americans, the french and their allies definitely from lebanon, putting an end to any coloni[X]st entity on our land", the submission of the christian phalangists to "just power", bringing them to justice "for the crimes they have perpetrated against muslims and christians", and permitting "all the sons of our people" to choose the form of government they want, while calling on them to "pick the option of [Y]ic government".

the ideology of hezbollah has been summarized as shi'i radic[X]sm; hezbollah follows the [Y]ic shi'a theology developed by iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini.

in 2010, iran's parliamentary speaker [X] larijani said, "iran takes pride in lebanon's [Y]ic resistance movement for its steadfast [Y]ic stance.

materials aimed at instilling principles of nation[X]sm and [Y] in children are an aspect of hezbollah's media operations.

[X] kourani, the first hezbollah operative to be convicted and sentenced in the united states, was under investigation since 2013 and worked to provide targeting and terrorist recruiting information to hezbollah's [Y]ic jihad organization.

" tuení believed that hezbollah's evolution is cosmetic, conce[X]ng a sinister long-term strategy to [Y]icize lebanon and lead it into a ruinous war with israel.

academics speci[X]zing in a wide variety of the social sciences believe that hezbollah is an example of an [Y]ic terrorist organization.

hyenas are used for food and medicinal purposes in som[X]a although they are considered haraam in [Y].

in the court of al-ma'mun, imam [X] al-ridha, a descendant of the prophet muhammad and chief [Y]ic scholar in the time of the abbasid c[X]phs, was asked by the exilarch to prove that muhammad was a prophet through the torah.

the famous and revered persian [Y]ic scholar and polymath ibn qutaybah, who served as a judge during the abbasid c[X]phate, said of the prophet habakkuk: "among the words of habakkuk, who prophesied in the days of daniel, habakkuk says: 'god came from teman, and the holy one from the mountains of paran and the earth was filled with the sanctification of the praiseworthy one (aḥmad, which is a name of muhammad in [Y]), and with his right hand he exercised power over the earth and the necks of the nations,'" which has been interpreted by scholars to be a clear allusion to habakkuk 3:3-4.

the shah urged that humayun convert from sunni to shia [Y] in order to keep himself and several hundred followers [X]ve.

 during emperor shah jahan and his son aurangzeb's [Y]ic sharia reigns, the empire reached its architectural and economic zenith, and became the world's largest economy, worth over 25% of world gdp and signaled the proto-industri[X]zation.

the birth of [Y] opposite som[X]a's red sea coast meant that som[X] merchants and sailors living on the arabian peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted arab muslim trading partners.

 with the migration of muslim families from the [Y]ic world to som[X]a in the early centuries of [Y], and the peaceful conversion of the som[X] population by som[X] muslim scholars in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into [Y]ic mogadishu, berbera, zeila, barawa and merka, which were part of the berber (the medieval arab term for the ancestors of the modern som[X]s) civilization.

 the berber people, being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to arab exclusivity in orthodox [Y], adopted shi'ite and kharijite [Y], both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the abbasid c[X]phate.

 he invited scholars and architects like ishal al-tuedjin (al-sahili) to further integrate m[X] into the [Y]ic world.

 [Y] was used to extend his authority by declaring jihad on the mossi, reviving the trans-saharan trade, and having the abbasid "shadow" c[X]ph in cairo declare him as c[X]ph of sudan.

 in 1981, sadat was assassinated by members of the egyptian [Y]ic jihad under kh[X]d [Y]bouli.

 north africa serves as a raci[X]zed region of “european africa”, which is conceptually disconnected from sub-saharan africa, and conceptually connected to the middle east, asia, and the [Y]ic world.

as opposed to having been developed through field research, the analogy in the present-day european africanist paradigm, which conceptually [X]enates, dehistoricizes, and denatur[X]zes darker skinned north africans in north africa and darker skinned africans throughout the [Y]ic world at-large, is primarily rooted in an americanized textual tradition inherited from 19th century european christian abolitionists.

 under boumédiène's rule, leftist and soci[X]st concepts were merged with [Y].

  on one hand, he made token concessions and cosmetic changes to the government to appear more [Y]ic, such as putting [Y]ist ahmed taleb ibrahimi in charge of national education in 1965 and adopting policies crimin[X]zing gambling, establishing friday as the national holiday, and dropping plans to introduce birth control to paint an [Y]ic image of the new government.

 the ottoman government followed [Y]ic law when de[X]ng with the conquered christian population.

 the division was between the tanzeem nasle nau hazara, a party based in quetta, of hazara nation[X]sts and secular intellectuals, and the [Y]ist parties in hazarajat.

as the soviets withdrew in 1989, the [Y]ist groups felt the need to broaden their political appeal and turned their focus to hazara ethnic nation[X]sm.

 hazara famous football players are zohib [Y] amiri, who is currently playing for the afghanistan national football team, moshtagh yaghoubi an afghan-finnish footballer who plays for hifk, mustafa amini an afghan-austr[X]an footballer who plays as a midfielder for danish superliga club agf and the austr[X]an national team, rahmat akbari an afghan-austr[X]an footballer who plays as a midfielder for brisbane roar, and others like [X] hazara and zahra mahmoodi.

 this was influenced by the direction, energy, and resources that the early umayyad c[X]phs directed after the death of prophet muhammad (632 ce) towards spreading [Y] to the nations that they invaded and the expansion of their c[X]phate.

 however, this rising interest in [Y]ic medicine grew significantly when the abbasid c[X]phate (750-1258 ce) overthrew the umayyad c[X]phate in 750 ce.

 additionally, during this time the creation of the first [Y]ic hospital in 805 ce by the abbasid c[X]ph harun al-rashid in baghdad was recounted as a glorious event of the golden age.

 taking leads from greece and rome, [Y]ic scholars kept both the art and science of medicine [X]ve and moving forward.

 institution[X]zation of medicine was another important achievement in the [Y]ic world.

 although hospitals as an institution for the sick emerged in the byzantium empire, the model of institution[X]zed medicine for all social classes was extensive in the [Y]ic empire and was scattered throughout.

in the south, sicily had become an [Y]ic emirate in the 9th century, thriving until the italo-normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the lombard and byzantine princip[X]ties of southern italy.

 donations are allowed to christian, jewish, buddhist and hindu communities; however, [Y] remains excluded, since no muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the it[X]an state.

 the country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the united nations, world trade organization, g20, and a founding member of the non-[X]gned movement, association of southeast asian nations, east asia summit, and the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation.

indonesia has been a member of the united nations since 1950 and was a founding member of the non-[X]gned movement (nam) and the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation (oic).

 trade, [Y]ic missionary activity such as by the w[X] sanga and chinese explorer zheng he, and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of [Y].

 while india was the only south asian country to recognise the soviet-backed democratic republic of afghanistan in the 1980s, its relations were diminished during the afghan civil wars and the rule of the [Y]ist t[X]ban in the 1990s.

 on 10 september 1912, the first nation[X]st mass movement was formed: sarekat [Y].

as a multi-ethnic and multicultural democratic country with a muslim-majority population, indonesia faces the challenge of de[X]ng with terrorism linked to global militant [Y]ic movements.

 one cultural pattern consists of the formerly indianized, rice-growing peasants in the valleys and plains of sumatra, java, and b[X], another cultural complex is composed of the largely [Y]ic coastal commercial sector, a third, more marginal sector consists of the upland forest farming communities which exist by means of subsistence swidden agriculture.

 since 2001, the government of indonesia has co-operated with the us in cracking down on [Y]ic fundament[X]sm and terrorist groups.

the government of iran is an [Y]ic theocracy which includes elements of a presidential democracy, with the ultimate authority vested in an autocratic "supreme leader", a position held by [X] khamenei since khomeini's death in 1989.

 although both nation[X]sts and marxists had initially joined with [Y]ists to overthrow the shah, tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards.

 three days after, iran's [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps launched a ret[X]atory attack on us forces in iraq and by accident shot down ukraine international airlines flight 752, killing 176 civilians and leading to nation-wide protests.

 chapter ix of the constitution of the [Y]ic republic of iran sets forth the qu[X]fications for presidential candidates.

the [Y]ic republic of iran has two types of armed forces: the regular forces of the army, the air force, and the navy, and the revolutionary guards, tot[X]ng about 545,000 active troops.

legal public holidays based on the iranian solar calendar include the cultural celebrations of nowruz (farvardin 1–4; 21–24 march) and sizdebedar (farvardin 13; 2april), and the political events of [Y]ic republic day (farvardin 12; 1april), the death of ruhollah khomeini (khordad 14; 4june), the khordad 15 event (khordad 15; 5june), the anniversary of the 1979 revolution (bahman 22; 10 february), and oil nation[X]zation day (esfand 29; 19 march).

lunar [Y]ic public holidays include tasua (muharram 9; 30 september), ashura (muharram 10; 1october), arba'een (safar 20; 10 november), the death of muhammad (safar 28; 17 november), the death of [X] al-ridha (safar 29 or 30; 18 november), the birthday of muhammad (rabi-al-awwal 17; 6december), the death of fatimah (jumada-al-thani 3; 2march), the birthday of [X] (rajab 13; 10 april), muhammad's first revelation (rajab 27; 24 april), the birthday of muhammad al-mahdi (sha'ban 15; 12 may), the death of [X] (ramadan 21; 16 june), eid al-fitr (shawwal 1–2; 26–27 june), the death of ja'far al-sadiq (shawwal 25; 20 july), eid al-qurban (zulhijja 10; 1september), and eid al-qadir (zulhijja 18; 9september).

 the sassanid empire was eventually conquered by the rashidun c[X]phate in the 7th century, with iraq specifically falling under [Y]ic rule following the battle of al-qadisiyyah in 636.

 baghdad would remain the capital of the abbasid c[X]phate for the majority of its existence, during which time it became the cultural and intellectual center of the world in what is known today as the [Y]ic golden age.

in spite of having lost all governance, the abbasid c[X]phs nevertheless maintained a highly ritu[X]zed court in baghdad and remained influential in religious matters, maintaining the orthodoxy of their sunni sect in opposition to the ismaili and shia  sects of [Y].

 this demand of behramani caused much dismay on the american side as it made clear to them that they would not be de[X]ng solely with a "moderate" faction in the [Y]ic republic, as the americans liked to pretend to themselves, but rather with all the factions in the iranian government – including those who were very much involved in terrorism.

kh[X]d chraibi, the reform of the [Y]ic calendar: the terms of the debate, tabsir.

 following the abbasid takeover from the umayyads and the shift of the economic centre of the [Y]ic c[X]phate from damascus to baghdad, the western province of al-andalus was margin[X]sed and ultimately became politically autonomous as independent emirate in 756, ruled by one of the last surviving umayyad royals, abd al-rahman i.

tensions between iraq and iran were fuelled by iran's [Y]ic revolution and its appearance of being a pan-[Y]ic force, in contrast to iraq's arab nation[X]sm.

 iran's new [Y]ic administration was regarded in baghdad as an irrational, existential threat to the ba'ath government, especially because the ba'ath party, having a secular nature, discriminated against and posed a threat to the fundament[X]st shia movement in iraq, whose clerics were iran's allies within iraq and whom khomeini saw as oppressed.

 on 28 june 1981, they assassinated the secretary-general of the [Y]ic republican party, mohammad beheshti and on 30 august, killed iran's president, mohammad-[X] rajai.

 the [Y]ic revolution of iran was strengthened and radic[X]sed.

economic historians and authors such as mendels, pomeranz and kridte argue that proto-industri[X]zation in parts of europe, [Y]ic world, mughal india, and china created the social and economic conditions that led to the industrial revolution, thus causing the great divergence.

[Y]ism (also often called political [Y] or [Y]ic fundament[X]sm) is a political ideology which posits that modern states and regions should be reconstituted in constitutional, economic and judicial terms, in accordance with what is conceived as a revival or a return to authentic [Y]ic practice in its tot[X]ty.

 [Y]ists may emphasize the implementation of sharia, pan-[Y]ic political unity, the creation of [Y]ic states, or the outright removal of non-muslim influences; particularly of western or universal economic, military, political, social, or cultural nature in the muslim world; that they believe to be incompatible with [Y] and a form of western neocoloni[X]sm.

 by the turn of the twentieth century the shorter and purely arabic term "[Y]" had begun to  displace it, and by 1938, when orient[X]st scholars completed the encyclopaedia of [Y], [Y]ism seems to have virtually disappeared from english usage.

 from french, it began to migrate to the english language in the mid-1980s, and in recent years has largely displaced the term [Y]ic fundament[X]sm in academic circles.

the new use of the term "[Y]ism" at first functioned as "a marker for scholars more likely to sympathize" with new [Y]ic movements; however, as the term gained popularity it became more specifically associated with political groups such as the t[X]ban or the algerian armed [Y]ic group, as well as with highly publicized acts of violence.

 to all intents and purposes, [Y]ic fundament[X]sm and [Y]ism have become synonyms in contemporary american usage.

] the whole body of thought which seeks to invest society with [Y] which may be integrationist, but may also be tradition[X]st, reform-minded or even revolutionary"

 jihadist organizations like al-qaeda and the egyptian [Y]ic jihad, and groups such as the t[X]ban, entirely reject democracy, often declaring as kuffar those muslims who support it (see takfirism), as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis.

 fuller has described as the fundament[X]st "guardians of the tradition" (salafis, such as those in the wahhabi movement) and the "vanguard of change and [Y]ic reform" centered around the muslim brotherhood.

a writer for the international crisis group maintains that "the conception of 'political [Y]'" is a creation of americans to explain the iranian [Y]ic revolution and apolitical [Y] was a historical fluke of the "short-lived era of the heyday of secular arab nation[X]sm between 1945 and 1970", and it is quietist/non-political [Y], not [Y]ism, that requires explanation.

 olivier roy believes "the socioeconomic re[X]ties that sustained the [Y]ist wave are still here and are not going to change: poverty, uprootedness, crises in values and identities, the decay of the educational systems, the north-south opposition, and the problem of immigrant integration into the host societies".

 critics of the concept hold that [Y]ist aspirations are fundamentally incompatible with the democratic principles, thus even moderate [Y]ists are tot[X]tarian in nature.

" this state originally pertained only to iran, where "post-[Y]ism is expressed in the idea of fusion between [Y] (as a person[X]zed faith) and individual freedom and choice; and post-[Y]ism is associated with the values of democracy and aspects of modernity".

 there, muslim brothers' [Y]ism had synthesized with salafism, and led to the creation of the salafi activist trend exemplified by the sahwa movement in the 80s, promulgated by safar al-haw[X] and salman al-ouda.

 wahhabism is also characterized by its disinterest in social justice, anticoloni[X]sm, or economic equ[X]ty, expounded upon by the mainstream [Y]ists.

 under this condition, qutb had cultivated his [Y]ist ideology in his seminal work ma'[X]m fi-l-tariq (milestones), in which he equated the muslims within the nasser regime with secularism and the west, and described them as regression back to jahiliyyah (period of time before the advent of [Y]).

salafi jihadism is a term coined by gilles kepel in 2002, referring to the ideology which actively promotes and conducts violence and terrorism in order to pursue the establishment of an [Y]ic state or a new c[X]phate.

some [Y]ic reviv[X]st movements and leaders pre-dating [Y]ism include:

 shah w[X]ullah was a forerunner of reformist [Y]ists like muhammad abduh, muhammad iqbal and muhammad asad in his belief that there was "a constant need for new ijtihad as the muslim community progressed and expanded and new generations had to cope with new problems" and his interest in the social and economic problems of the poor.

 sayyid ahmad barelvi was a disciple and successor of shah w[X]ullah's son who emphasized the 'purification' of [Y] from un-[Y]ic beliefs and practices.

  unlike some later [Y]ists, early salafiyya strongly emphasized the restoration of the c[X]phate.

the crises experienced across the muslim world after the collapse of ottoman c[X]phate would re-introduce the debates over the theory of an alternative [Y]ic state into the centre of muslim religious-political thinking of the early 20th-century.

 as the circumstances shifted through further western cultural and imperial inroads, militant [Y]ists and fundament[X]sts stepped up to assert [Y]ic values using rida's ideas as the chief vehicle, starting from 1950s.

in his influential book al-khilafa aw al-imama al-'uzma ("the c[X]phate or the grand imamate"); rashid rida elaborated on the establishment of his proposed “[Y]ic state”  which emphasised the implementation of sharia as well as the adoption of an [Y]ic consultation system (shura) that enshrined leading role of the ulema ([Y]ic scholars) in political life.

in rida's c[X]phate, the kh[X]fa was to be the supreme head whose role was to govern by supervising the application of [Y]ic laws.

 this khilafa shall also be able to revit[X]se the [Y]ic civilization, restore political and legal independence to the muslim umma (community of muslim believers), and cleanse [Y] from the heretical influences of sufism.

 rashid rida's [Y]ic political theory would greatly influence many subsequent [Y]ic reviv[X]st movements across the arab world.

 rida was certain that an [Y]ic society which implemented sharia in the proper manner would be able to successfully resist both capit[X]sm as well as the disorder of class-based soci[X]sm; since such a society would be unsusceptible to its temptations.

muhammad iqbal was a philosopher, poet and politician in british india who is widely regarded as having inspired the [Y]ic nation[X]sm and pakistan movement in british india.

iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nation[X]sm weaken the spiritual foundations of [Y] and muslim society, but that india's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage, culture and political influence.

 in his travels to egypt, afghanistan, palestine and syria, he promoted ideas of greater [Y]ic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nation[X]st differences.

 trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journ[X]sm, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about [Y] and [Y]ic law.

maududi's political ideas influenced sayyid qutb a leading member of the muslim brotherhood movement, and one of the key philosophers of [Y]ism and highly influential thinkers of [Y]ic univers[X]sm.

 sharia law was not only accessible to humans and essential to the existence of [Y], but also all-encompassing, precluding "evil and corrupt" non-[Y]ic ideologies like communism, nation[X]sm, or secular democracy.

 ba'athism, arab soci[X]sm, and arab nation[X]sm suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic [Y]ist movements inspired by maududi and sayyid qutb gained ground.

the views of [X] shariati, the ideologue of the iranian revolution, resembled those of mohammad iqbal, the ideological father of the state of pakistan, but khomeini's beliefs are perceived to be placed somewhere between the beliefs of shia [Y] and the beliefs of sunni [Y]ic thinkers like mawdudi and qutb.

 he believed that complete imitation of the prophet mohammad and his successors such as [X] for the restoration of sharia law was essential to [Y], that many secular, westernizing muslims were actually agents of the west and therefore serving western interests, and that acts such as the "plundering" of muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against [Y] by western governments.

 khomeini talked not about restoring the c[X]phate or sunni [Y]ic democracy, but about establishing a state where the guardianship of the democratic or the dictatorial political system was performed by shia jurists (ulama) as the successors of shia imams until the mahdi returns from occultation.

the revolution was influenced by marxism through [Y]ist thought and also by writings that sought either to counter marxism (muhammad baqir al-sadr's work) or to integrate soci[X]sm and [Y]ism  ([X] shariati's work).

the strength of the [Y]ist movement was manifest in an event which might have seemed sure to turn muslim public opinion against fundament[X]sm, but did just the opposite.

instead of prompting a backlash against the movement from which the attackers originated, however, saudi arabia, already very conservative, responded by shoring up its fundament[X]st credentials with even more [Y]ic restrictions.

in other muslim countries, blame for and wrath against the seizure was directed not against fundament[X]sts, but against [Y]ic fundament[X]sm's foremost geopolitical enemy—the united states.

another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radic[X]ze the [Y]ist movement was the gulf war, which brought several hundred thousand us and allied non-muslim military personnel to saudi arabian soil to put an end to saddam hussein's occupation of kuwait.

  [Y]ism had been an ide[X]zed/utopian  concept to compare with the grim re[X]ty of the status quo, but in more than four decades it had failed to establish a "concrete and viable blueprint for society" despite repeated efforts (olivier roy); and instead had left a less than inspiring track record of its impact on the world (nader hashemi).

 in 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic [Y]ist movement known as the t[X]ban rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of afghanistan.

 the t[X]ban differed from other [Y]ist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as [Y]ic fundament[X]st or neofundament[X]st, interested in spreading "an ide[X]zed and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs" under the label of sharia to an entire country.

 founded as a broad [Y]ist co[X]tion in 1989 it was led by abbassi madani, and a charismatic [Y]ist young preacher, [X] belhadj.

 since 2000, the main political opposition bangladesh nation[X]st party (bnp) has been allied with it and another [Y]ic party, [Y]i oikya jote.

 [X] bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with [Y]ists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown.

 the green algeria alliance is an [Y]ist co[X]tion of political parties, created for the legislative election of 2012 in algeria.

 however, the incumbent co[X]tion, comprising the fln of president abdelaziz bouteflika and the rnd of prime minister ahmed ouyahia, held on to power after winning a majority of seats, and the [Y]ist parties of the green algeria alliance lost seats in the legislative election of 2012.

 eastern africa has become a hotbed of violent [Y]ic extremism since the late 1990s, one of the relevant movements being al-shabaab, active in som[X]a and kenya, which emerged in response to the 2006–09 ethiopian intervention in som[X]a.

 west africa has seen the rise of influential [Y]ic extremist organizations, notably boko haram in northern nigeria and al-qaeda in the [Y]ic maghreb in m[X].

 ht is unique from most other [Y]ist movements in that the party focuses not on implementation of sharia on local level or on providing social services, but on unifying the muslim world under its vision of a new [Y]ic c[X]phate spanning from north africa and the middle east to much of central and south asia.

in its focus on the c[X]phate, the party takes a different view of muslim history than some other [Y]ists such as muhammad qutb.

 ht sees [Y]'s pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of [X], or one of the other four "rightly guided" c[X]phs in the 7th century, but with the abolition of the ottoman c[X]phate in 1924.

 such a demographic, [X]enated from the westernized ways of the urban elite, but uprooted from the comforts and more passive traditions of the villages they came from, is understandably favourably disposed to an [Y]ic system promising a better world—an ideology providing an "emotionally familiar basis for group identity, solidarity, and exclusion; an acceptable basis for legitimacy and authority; an immediately intelligible formulation of principles for both a critique of the present and a program for the future.

[Y]ism can also be described as part of identity politics, specifically the religiously-oriented nation[X]sm that emerged in the third world in the 1970s: "resurgent hinduism in india, religious zionism in israel, militant buddhism in sri lanka, resurgent sikh nation[X]sm in the punjab, 'liberation theology' of catholicism in latin america, and [Y]ism in the muslim world.

the connection between the lack of an [Y]ic spirit and the lack of victory was underscored by the disastrous defeat of arab nation[X]st-led armies fighting under the slogan "land, sea and air" in the 1967 six-day war, compared to the (perceived) near-victory of the yom kippur war six years later.

 speci[X]zes in comparative and international politics; women, gender, and [Y]; [Y] and qur'anic hermeneutics

 within the quran, it's never stated that homosexu[X]ty is punishable by death, and modern historians conclude that the [Y]ic prophet muhammad never forbade homosexual relationships, although he shared contempt towards them alongside his contemporaries.

 the conceptions of homosexu[X]ty found in classical [Y]ic texts resemble the traditions of greco-roman antiquity rather than the modern understanding of sexual orientation.

 public attitudes toward homosexu[X]ty in the muslim world underwent a marked negative change starting from the 19th century through the global spread of [Y]ic fundament[X]st movements such as salafism and wahhabism, and the influence of the sexual notions and restrictive norms prevalent in europe at the time: a number of muslim-majority countries have retained criminal penalties for homosexual acts enacted under european colonial rule.

some scholars (both western and [Y]ic) argue that in the course of the quranic lot story, homosexu[X]ty in the modern sense is not addressed, but that the destruction of the "people of lut" was a result of breaking the ancient hospit[X]ty law and sexual violence, in this case the attempted rape of men.

classical [Y]ic jurists did not deal with homosexu[X]ty as a sexual orientation, since the latter concept is modern and has no match in traditional law, which dealt with it under the technical terms of liwat and zina.

" one scholar represents the conventional perspective by arguing that the qur'an "is very explicit in its condemnation of homosexu[X]ty leaving scarcely any loophole for a theological accommodation of homosexu[X]ty in [Y].

many muslim scholars have followed a "don't ask, don't tell" policy in regards to homosexu[X]ty in [Y], by treating the subject with passivity.

mohamed el-moctar el-shinqiti, director of the [Y]ic center of south plains in texas, has argued that "[even though] homosexu[X]ty is a grievous sin.

egyptian [Y]ist journ[X]st muhammad jalal kishk also found no punishment for homosexual acts prescribed in the quran, regarding the hadith that mentioned it as poorly attested.

" under this reading, [Y] can be described as "a religion that positively assesses diversity in creation and in human societies," allowing gay and lesbian muslims to view homosexu[X]ty as representing the "natural diversity in sexu[X]ty in human societies.

abdessamad dialmy in his 2010 article, sexu[X]ty and [Y], addressed "sexual norms defined by the sacred texts (koran and sunna).

history of homosexu[X]ty in [Y]ic societies

"homosexu[X]ty was a key symbolic issue throughout the middle ages in [[Y]ic] iberia.

" although early [Y]ic writings such as the quran expressed a mildly negative attitude towards homosexu[X]ty, laypersons usually apprehended the idea with indifference, if not admiration.

the 18th and 19th centuries saw the rise of [Y]ic fundament[X]sm such as wahhabism, which came to call for stricter adherence to the hadith.

 in iran, several hundred political opponents were executed in the aftermath of the 1979 [Y]ic revolution and justified it by accusing them of homosexu[X]ty, and homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in iran's [Y]ic penal code, enacted in 1991.

 in iraq, where homosexu[X]ty is legal, the breakdown of law and order following the second gulf war allowed [Y]ist militias and vigilantes to act on their prejudice against gays, with isis gaining particular notoritety for the gruesome acts of anti-lgbt violence committed under its rule of parts of syria and iraq.

 scott siraj al-haqq kugle has argued that, while "muslims commemorate the early days of [Y] when they were oppressed as a margin[X]zed few," many of them now forget their history and fail to protect "muslims who are gay, transgender and lesbian.

" views about homosexu[X]ty have never been universal all across the [Y]ic world.

 with reference to the muslim world more broadly, tilo beckers writes that "besides the endogenous changes in the interpretation of scriptures having a deliber[X]zing influence that came from within [Y]ic cultures, the rejection of homosexu[X]ty in [Y] gained momentum through the exogenous effects of european coloni[X]sm, that is, the import of western cultural understandings of homosexu[X]ty as a perversion.

 bauer continues that "although contemporary [Y]ist movements decry homosexu[X]ty as a form of western decadence, the current prejudice against it among muslim publics stems from an amalgamation of traditional [Y]ic legal theory with popular notions that were imported from europe during the colonial era, when western military and economic superiority made western notions of sexu[X]ty particularly influential in the muslim world.

 however, as dynes and donaldson point out, north african countries under french colonial tutelage lacked anti-homosexual laws which were only born afterwards, with the full weight of [Y]ic opinion descending on those who, on the model of the gay liberationists of the west, would seek to make "homosexu[X]ty" (above all, adult men taking passive roles) publicly respectable.

 persecution of homosexuals has been exacerbated in recent decades by a rise in [Y]ic fundament[X]sm and the emergence of the gay-rights movement in the west, which allowed [Y]ists to paint homosexu[X]ty as a noxious western import.

while friendship between men and boys is often described in sexual ways in classical [Y]ic literature, khaled el-rouayheb and oliver leaman have argued that it would be misleading to conclude from this that homosexu[X]ty was widespread in practice.

in india, which has the third-largest muslim population in the world, and where muslims form a large minority, the largest [Y]ic seminary (darul uloom deoband) has vehemently opposed recent government moves to abrogate and liber[X]ze laws from the colonial era that banned homosexu[X]ty.

in indonesia, most parts of the country do not have a sodomy law and do not currently crimin[X]ze private, non-commercial homosexual acts among consenting adults, except in the aceh province  where homosexu[X]ty is illegal for muslims under [Y]ic sharia law, and punishable by flogging.

 some muslims say that "no good muslim can be gay," and "traditional schools of [Y]ic law consider homosexu[X]ty a grave sin.

the belief in the veracity of this hadith was a contributing factor in the efforts by successive c[X]phs to subsidize translations of "greek, hebrew and syriac science and philosophy texts", and the saying continues to be heavily emphasised to this day in certain [Y]ic traditions advocating intellectu[X]sm over violence, for example in timbuktu, where it is central to one of two key lessons in the work tuhfat al-fudala by the 16th-century berber scholar ahmed baba.

in the early era that inspired classical [Y] (rashidun c[X]phate) and lasted less than a century, jihad spread the realm of [Y] to include millions of subjects, and an area extending "from the borders of india and china to the pyrenees and the atlantic".

rudolph peters also wrote that with the stagnation of [Y]ic expansionism, the concept of jihad became intern[X]zed as a moral or spiritual struggle.

bernard lewis states that while most [Y]ic theologians in the classical period (750–1258 ce) understood jihad to be a military endeavor, after [Y]ic conquest stagnated and the c[X]phate broke up into smaller states the "irresistible and permanent jihad came to an end".

with the [Y]ic revival, a new "fundament[X]st" movement arose, with some different interpretations of [Y], which often placed an increased emphasis on jihad.

 delong-bas, the new "fundament[X]st" movement brought a reinterpretation of [Y] and their own writings on jihad.

contemporary [Y]ic fundament[X]sts were often influenced by medieval [Y]ic jurist ibn taymiyyah's, and egyptian journ[X]st sayyid qutb's, ideas on jihad.

 while qutb felt that jihad was a proclamation of "liberation for humanity" (in which humanity has the free choice between [Y] and unbelief), faraj saw jihad as a mean of conquering the world and reestablishing the c[X]phate.

 according to the legal historian sadarat kadri, during the last couple of centuries, incremental changes in [Y]ic legal doctrine (developed by [Y]ists who otherwise condemn any bid‘ah (innovation) in religion), have "norm[X]zed" what was once "unthinkable".

 rudoph peters writes that, in the contemporary world, tradition[X]st muslims understand jihad from classical works on fiqh; modernist muslims regard jihad as a just war in international law and emphasize its defensive aspects; and fundament[X]sts view it as an expansion of [Y] and re[X]zation of [Y]ic ideals.

 in a commentary of the hadith sahih muslim, entitled al-minhaj, the medieval [Y]ic scholar yahya ibn sharaf al-nawawi stated that "one of the collective duties of the community as a whole (fard kifaya) is to lodge a v[X]d protest, to solve problems of religion, to have knowledge of divine law, to command what is right and forbid wrong conduct".

 in this context, jihad refers to the use of violence, including paramilitary action against persons, governments deemed to be enemies of the fundament[X]st version of [Y].

most pesantren ([Y]ic boarding schools) in jakarta are affiliated with the tradition[X]st nahdlatul ulama, modernist organisations mostly catering to a socioeconomic class of educated urban elites and merchant traders.

a convert to sunni [Y] in c[X]fornia at age 16, lindh traveled to yemen in 1998 to study arabic and stayed there for 10 months.

 in february 2015, lindh wrote to a c[X]fornia television producer expressing support for isis or the [Y]ic state, the militant group that had recently beheaded five westerners in televised executions.

 the [Y]ic state is clearly very sincere and serious about fulfilling the long-neglected religious obligation of establishing a c[X]phate through armed struggle, which is the only correct method.

 the qağan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to [Y], and to subject himself to the c[X]phate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the umayyads and byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the khazars re-asserted their independence.

 in 913, however, two years after byzantium concluded a peace treaty with the rus' in 911, a varangian foray, with khazar connivance, through arab lands led to a request to the khazar throne by the khwârazmian [Y]ic guard for permission to ret[X]ate against the large rus' contingent on its return.

 many khazar mercenaries served in the armies of the [Y]ic c[X]phates and other states.

 some evidence suggests that the khazar king saw himself as a defender of jews even beyond the kingdom's frontiers, ret[X]ating against muslim or christian interests in khazaria in the wake of [Y]ic and byzantine persecutions of jews abroad.

 numerous acts of vand[X]sm and destruction of heritage were carried out by suspected [Y]ist militias, including the removal of the nude gazelle statue and the destruction and desecration of world war ii-era british grave sites near benghazi.

 many other cases of heritage vand[X]sm were carried out and were reported to be carried out by [Y]ist-related radical militias and mobs that either destroyed, robbed, or looted a number of historic sites, which remain in danger at present.

 lebanon is a founding member of the united nations and is a member of the arab league, the non-[X]gned movement, the organization of [Y]ic cooperation, and the organisation internationale de la francophonie.

 chairman mustafa abdul j[X]l said libya would become an [Y]ic democracy in the wake of gaddafi's death, though the extent of [Y]ic law's influence would be determined by elected lawmakers.

 these events appear to have happened during the period when [Y]ic brotherhood - or "more inclined to [Y]ic values" gnc political parties led by nouri abusahmein, who have issued a number of reforms or decrees that would formulate a more [Y]ic nation in tripoli, that led to the creation of more fundament[X]st laws (such as internet censorship and adaptation of vague rules in reporting news banning critique of the february 17th revolution).

however, due to the breakup of country politically and the infighting between militia and authorities, and the rivalry to the muslim brotherhood or, simply known as 'more salafi or fundament[X]st [Y]ists' parties or groups, the country has fragmented in a plethora of different political beliefs.

sierra leone is also a member of the united nations and its speci[X]sed agencies, the african union, the african development bank (afdb), the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation (oic), and the non-[X]gned movement (nam).

 the vast majority of sierra leonean muslims are adherent to the m[X]ki school of sunni [Y].

 the m[X]ki school is by far the largest and most dominant [Y]ic school of jurisprudence across sierra leone.

 it is a member of the united nations, the arab league, african union, non-[X]gned movement, and the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation.

in july 1976, barre's src disbanded itself and established in its place the som[X] revolutionary soci[X]st party (srsp), a one-party government based on scientific soci[X]sm and [Y]ic tenets.

 to solidify its rule, the tfg formed an alliance with the [Y]ic courts union, other members of the alliance for the re-liberation of som[X]a, and ahlu sunna waljama'a, a moderate sufi militia.

 within months, the tfg had gone from holding about 70% of south-central som[X]a's conflict zones, to losing control of over 80% of the disputed territory to the [Y]ist insurgents.

som[X] law draws from a mixture of three different systems: civil law, [Y]ic law and customary law.

 the constitution of som[X]a likewise defines [Y] as the state religion of the federal republic of som[X]a, and [Y]ic sharia law as the basic source for national legislation.

 [Y] may thus have been introduced into som[X]a well before the faith even took root in its place of origin.

in addition, the som[X] community has produced numerous important [Y]ic sheikhs and clerics over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of muslim learning and practice in the horn of africa, the arabian peninsula, and well beyond.

 among these [Y]ic scholars is the 14th-century som[X] theologian and jurist uthman bin [X] zayla'i of zeila, who wrote the single most authoritative text on the hanafi school of [Y], consisting of four volumes known as the tabayin al-haqa'iq li sharh kanz al-daqa'iq.

 this is attributed to the muslim nature of som[X] society and adherence of som[X]s to [Y]ic morals.

 to address shortcomings in religious instruction, the som[X] government on its own part also subsequently established the ministry of endowment and [Y]ic affairs, under which qur'anic education is now regulated.

som[X] scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of [Y]ic literature ranging from poetry to hadith.

the adoption of [Y] in som[X]a's early medieval history brought [Y]ic architectural influences from arabia and persia.

[Y] was introduced to the northern som[X] coast early on from the arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra.

 the resistance was spearheaded by sheikh abdi gafle and ma’[X]n mursal abdi yusuf; two prominent local [Y]ic teachers in marka from the bimal clan.

in july 1976, barre's src disbanded itself and established in its place the som[X] revolutionary soci[X]st party (srsp), a one-party government based on scientific soci[X]sm and [Y]ic tenets.

following the outbreak of the civil war and the ensuing collapse of the central government, som[X]a's residents reverted to local forms of conflict resolution, either secular, traditional or [Y]ic law, with a provision for appeal of all sentences.

[Y]ic shari'a has traditionally played a significant part in som[X] society.

between may 31st and june 9th 2008, representatives of som[X]a's federal government and the moderate alliance for the re-liberation of som[X]a (ars) group of [Y]ist rebels participated in peace talks in djibouti brokered by the former united nations special envoy to som[X]a, ahmedou ould-abdallah.

 to solidify its rule, the tfg formed an alliance with the [Y]ic courts union, other members of the alliance for the re-liberation of som[X]a, and ahlu sunna waljama'a, a moderate sufi militia.

 within months, the co[X]tion government had gone from holding about 70% of south-central som[X]a's conflict zones, territory which it had inherited from the previous yusuf administration, to losing control of over 80% of the disputed territory to the [Y]ist insurgents.

700–900: som[X]s adopt [Y].

 the som[X] judicial system is based on [Y]ic law, judicial authority of the federal republic is vested in the courts.

 funding the arpct co[X]tion, this alarmed many in south-central som[X]a, and recruits flocked to the ascendant [Y]ic courts union (icu).

 hardline [Y]ists subsequently gained power within the icu, prompting fears of a t[X]banization of the movement.

in december 2006, ethiopian troops entered som[X]a to assist the tfg against the advancing [Y]ic courts union, initially winning the battle of baidoa.

 sudan is a member of the united nations, the arab league, african union, comesa, non-[X]gned movement and the organisation of [Y]ic co-operation.

 during the 1990s, hassan al-turabi, then speaker of the national assembly, reached out to [Y]ic fundament[X]st groups, invited osama bin laden to the country.

 in addition, the "[Y]isation" encouraged by president al-bashir [X]enated many researchers: the official language of instruction in universities was changed from english to arabic and [Y]ic courses became mandatory.

in june 1986, sadiq al mahdi formed a co[X]tion government with umma party, the democratic unionist party (dup), the national [Y]ic front (nif), and four southern parties.

97% of the population adheres to [Y], with the overwhelming majority being adherents of the sunni sufi branch and the m[X]ki school of [Y]ic jurisprudence.

 in 1993, sudan transformed into an [Y]ic tot[X]tarian one-party state as al-bashir abolished the revolutionary command council and created the national [Y]ic front (nif) with a new parliament and government obtained solely by members of the nif, and proclaimed himself president of sudan.

president al-bashir's government was dominated by members of sudan's national [Y]ic front (nif), a fundament[X]st political organization formed from the muslim brotherhood in 1986; in 1998, the nif founded the national congress as its legal front; the national congress/nif dominates much of khartoum's overall domestic and foreign policies; president al-bashir named a new cabinet on april 20, 1996 which includes members of the national [Y]ic front, serving and retired military officers, and civilian technocrats; on march 8, 1998, he reshuffled the cabinet and brought in several former rebel and opposition members as ministers; he reshuffled his cabinet again on january 24, 2000 but announced few changes.

for the samaritans in particular, the passing of the al-hakim edict by the fatimid c[X]phate in 1021, under which all jews and christians in the fatimid ruled southern levant were ordered to either convert to [Y] or leave, along with another notable forced conversion to [Y] imposed at the hands of the rebel ibn firāsa, would contribute to their rapid unprecedented decrease, and ultimately almost complete extinction as a separate religious community.

sufism (), also known as tasawwuf (), is a mystic body of religious practice within [Y] characterized by a focus on [Y]ic spiritu[X]ty, ritu[X]sm, asceticism and esotericism.

 while sufis strictly observed [Y]ic law and belonged to various schools of [Y]ic jurisprudence and theology, they are unified by their opposition to dry leg[X]sm.

sufism emerged early on in [Y]ic history, partly as a reaction against the worldliness of the early umayyad c[X]phate (661–750), and sufis played an important role in [Y]ic history through their missionary and educational activities.

despite a relative decline of sufi orders in the modern era, sufism has continued to play an important role in the [Y]ic world, and has also influenced various forms of spiritu[X]ty in the west.

some modern scholars have used other definitions of sufism such as "intensification of [Y]ic faith and practice" and "process of re[X]zing ethical and spiritual ideals".

the term sufism was originally introduced into european languages in the 18th century by orient[X]st scholars, who viewed it mainly as an intellectual doctrine and literary tradition at variance with what they saw as sterile monotheism of [Y].

modern academics and scholars have rejected early orient[X]st theories asserting a non-[Y]ic origin of sufism; the consensus is that it emerged in western asia.

practitioners of sufism hold that in its early stages of development sufism effectively referred to nothing more than the intern[X]zation of [Y].

" academic studies of sufism confirm that sufism, as a separate tradition from [Y] apart from so-called pure [Y], is frequently a product of western orient[X]sm and modern [Y]ic fundament[X]sts.

 thus, it is precisely because it is historically proven that "many of the most eminent defenders of [Y]ic orthodoxy, such as abdul-qadir gilani, ghaz[X], and the sultan Ṣalāḥ ad-dīn (saladin) were connected with sufism" that the popular studies of writers like idries shah are continuously disregarded by scholars as conveying the fallacious image that "sufism" is somehow distinct from "[Y].

opposition to sufi teachers and orders from more liter[X]st and leg[X]st strains of [Y] existed in various forms throughout [Y]ic history.

around the turn of the 20th century, sufi rituals and doctrines also came under sustained criticism from modernist [Y]ic reformers, liberal nation[X]sts, and, some decades later, soci[X]st movements in the muslim world.

 its ability to articulate an inclusive [Y]ic identity with greater emphasis on personal and small-group piety has made sufism especially well-suited for contexts characterized by religious plur[X]sm and secularist perspectives.

in the modern world, the classical interpretation of sunni orthodoxy, which sees in sufism an essential dimension of [Y] alongside the disciplines of jurisprudence and theology, is represented by institutions such as egypt's al-azhar university and zaytuna college, with al-azhar's current grand imam ahmed el-tayeb recently defining "sunni orthodoxy" as being a follower "of any of the four schools of [legal] thought (hanafi, shafi’i, m[X]ki or hanb[X]) and .

 his manifold writings defined the practice of sufism as the essence of [Y], but also pointed to the univers[X]ty of its message.

the amman message, a detailed statement issued by 200 leading [Y]ic scholars in 2005 in amman, specifically recognized the v[X]dity of sufism as a part of [Y].

 this usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in [Y] or sufism led to doubts being cast over the v[X]dity of sufism as a part of [Y].

the term neo-sufism was originally coined by fazlur rahman and used by other scholars to describe reformist currents among 18th century sufi orders, whose goal was to remove some of the more ecstatic and pantheistic elements of the sufi tradition and reassert the importance of [Y]ic law as the basis for inner spiritu[X]ty and social activism.

 in recent times, it has been increasingly used by scholars like mark sedgwick in another sense, to describe various forms of sufi-influenced spiritu[X]ty in the west, in particular the deconfession[X]zed spiritual movements which emphasize universal elements of the sufi tradition and de-emphasize its [Y]ic context.

in most other muslim-majority countries, attacks on sufis and especially their shrines have come from adherents of puritanical and reviv[X]st [Y]ic movements (salafis and wahhabis), who believe that practices such as visitation to and veneration of the tombs of sufi saints, celebration of the birthdays of sufi saints, and dhikr ("remembrance" of god) ceremonies are bid‘ah (impure "innovation") and shirk ("polytheistic").

the [Y]ic institute in mannheim, germany, which works towards the integration of europe and muslims, sees sufism as particularly suited for interreligious dialogue and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and plur[X]st societies; it has described sufism as a symbol of tolerance and humanism—nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent.

 one of the outstanding pieces in the brooklyn museum's [Y]ic gallery has been the museum's associate curator of [Y]ic art, is a large 19th- or early-20th-century portrayal of the battle of karbala painted by abbas al-musavi, which was a violent episode in the disagreement between the sunni and shia branches of [Y]; during this battle, husayn ibn [X], a pious grandson of the [Y]ic prophet muhammad, died and is considered a martyr in [Y].

 in 2010, it formed the pakatan rakyat co[X]tion with parti keadilan rakyat (pkr) and parti [Y] se-malaysia (pas); the latter two parties had become active in sarawak between 1996 and 2001.

the best known form of [Y]ic mystic spiritu[X]ty is the sufi tradition (famous through rumi and hafiz) in which a sheikh or pir transmits spiritual discipline to students.

[Y] has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called w[X], which literally means 'friend [of god]'), which has declined in some parts of the [Y]ic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of salafism.

in 2010, anwar al-awlaki published an al-qaeda hit list in inspire magazine, including rushdie along with other figures claimed to have insulted [Y], including ayaan hirsi [X], cartoonist lars vilks, and three jyllands-posten staff members: kurt westergaard, carsten juste, and flemming rose.

 religious tot[X]tarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of [Y] and we see the tragic consequences in paris today.

 rushdie called the attack a consequence of "religious tot[X]tarianism" which according to him had caused "a deadly mutation in the heart of [Y]":

 shah jahan was an orthodox muslim, and it was during his time that [Y]ic reviv[X]st movements like the naqsbandi began to shape mughal policies.

 from the 18th century on, leading muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to the vit[X]ty of early [Y]ic jurisprudence.

 during the first few centuries of [Y], muftis were private legal speci[X]sts who normally also held other jobs.

 non-muslims residing under [Y]ic rule had the legal status of dhimmi, which entailed a number of protections, restrictions, freedoms and legal inequ[X]ties, including payment of the jizya tax.

 this, together with their conception of [Y]ic law as a collection of inflexible rules, led to an emphasis on tradition[X]st forms of sharia that were not rigorously applied in the pre-colonial period and served as a formative influence on the modern identity politics of the muslim world.

 [Y]ist leaders such as ayatollah khomeini drew on leftist anticoloni[X]st rhetoric by framing their call for sharia as a resistance struggle.

 this is particularly the case for the theorists of [Y]ic economics and [Y]ic finance, who have advocated both free-market and soci[X]st economic models.

 when osama bin laden and his associates issued a fatwa in 1998 proclaiming "jihad against jews and crusaders", many [Y]ic jurists, in addition to denouncing its content, stressed that bin laden was not qu[X]fied to either issue a fatwa or proclaim a jihad.

 elsewhere, policing of various interpretations of sharia-based public mor[X]ty has been carried out by the kano state hisbah corps in the nigerian state of kano, by polisi perda syariah [Y] in the aceh province of indonesia, by the committee for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice in the gaza strip, and by the t[X]ban during their 1996–2001 and 2021– rule of afghanistan.

a 2013 survey based on interviews of 38,000 muslims, randomly selected from urban and rural parts in 39 countries using area probability designs, by the pew forum on religion and public life found that a majority—in some cases "overwhelming" majority—of muslims in a number of countries support making "sharia" or "[Y]ic law" the law of the land, including afghanistan (99%), iraq (91%), niger (86%), malaysia (86%), pakistan (84%), morocco (83%), bangladesh (82%), egypt (74%), indonesia (72%), jordan (71%), uganda (66%), ethiopia (65%), m[X] (63%), ghana (58%), and tunisia (56%).

 in particular, in countries where muslim citizens have little experience with rigid application of sharia-based state laws, these notions tend to be more associated with [Y]ic ideals like equ[X]ty and social justice than with prohibitions.

in 2009, the journal free inquiry summarized the criticism of the cairo declaration in an editorial: "we are deeply concerned with the changes to the universal declaration of human rights by a co[X]tion of [Y]ic states within the united nations that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect [Y]'s limited view of human rights.

 in view of the conditions inside the [Y]ic republic of iran, egypt, pakistan, saudi arabia, the sudan, syria, bangladesh, iraq, and afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequ[X]ty of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters—in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations.

 in giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the [Y]ic law justifies the formal inequ[X]ty of individuals (women, non-[Y]ic people).

twenty-three muslim-majority countries, , pen[X]zed apostasy from [Y] through their criminal laws.

 public attitudes toward homosexu[X]ty in the muslim world turned more negative starting from the 19th century through the gradual spread of [Y]ic fundament[X]st movements such as salafism and wahhabism, and under the influence of sexual notions prevalent in europe at that time.

 the liter[X]st zāhirī school disagrees holding that there was no sunnah whose fulfillment is not rewarded or neglect punished, while classical [Y] holds that following non-binding al-sunna al-ʿādīyah is meritorious but not obligatory.

[Y]ic reviv[X]sm

with de-coloni[X]zation in the late 20th century, a new [Y]ic revival emerged.

 activists rather than theorists, they sought "to restore [Y] to ascendency", and in particular to restore sharia to the law of the lands of [Y] it had been before being replaced by "secular, western-inspired law codes" of coloni[X]sm and modernity.

in the 1960s, fazlur rahman m[X]k, an [Y]ic modernist and former head of pakistan's central institute for [Y]ic research, advanced another idea for how the (prophetic) sunnah—the normative example of the prophet—should be understood: as "a general umbrella concept" but not one "filled with absolutely specific content", or that was static over the centuries.

 to them muhammad's attitude, his piety, the qu[X]ty of his character constitute the truer and deeper aspect of what it means by sunnah in [Y], rather than the external aspects alone.

the connection between the sindh and [Y] was established by the initial muslim invasions during the rashidun c[X]phate.

muhammad [X] jinnah claimed that the pakistan movement started when the first muslim put his foot on the soil of sindh, which he labelled the "gateway of [Y]" in india.

during the thirteenth century, the c[X]phate system in the [Y]ic empire fell, and scientific discovery thrived.

 this period is seen formative in sunni [Y] as the founders of the four schools viz, abu hanifa, m[X]k ibn anas, shāfi'i and ahmad bin hanbal all practised during this time, so also did jafar al sādiq who elaborated the doctrine of imāmate, the basis for the shi'a religious thought.

 this was followed by a considerable rise in the influence of the wahhabi, salafiyya, [Y]ist and jihadist movements that revived the doctrines of the hanb[X] theologian taqi al-din ibn taymiyyah (1263-1328 c.

 this theological school of aqeedah was embraced by many muslim scholars and developed in parts of the [Y]ic world throughout history; al-ghaz[X] wrote on the creed discussing it and agreeing upon some of its principles.

tradition[X]st theology is a movement of [Y]ic scholars who reject ration[X]stic [Y]ic theology (kalam) in favor of strict textu[X]sm in interpreting the qur'an and sunnah.

 in the modern era, it has had a disproportionate impact on [Y]ic theology, having been appropriated by wahhabi and other tradition[X]st salafi currents and have spread well beyond the confines of the hanb[X] school of law.

 contrary to popular orient[X]st depictions, neither the founders of these orders nor their followers considered themselves to be anything other than orthodox sunni muslims, many of the most eminent defenders of [Y]ic orthodoxy, such as 'abd al-qadir jilani, al-ghaz[X], sultan Ṣalāḥ ad-dīn al-ayyubi (saladin) were connected with sufism.

 the [Y]ic world league in mecca, also funded by saudi arabia, made a resolution from 1987 that it regards sunnism as the pure teachings at the time of the messenger and the rightful existence of the c[X]phate.

 this backfired on iraq and the arab states, for khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed iraq and only managed to boost [Y]ic radic[X]sm not only within the arab states, but within iraq itself, creating new tensions between the sunni ba'ath party and the majority shi'a population.

" having removed the threat of iranian fundament[X]sm he "overran kuwait and confronted his gulf neighbors in the name of arab nation[X]sm and [Y].

" as a result, saddam hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to [Y]ic reviv[X]sm and also for the same reasons that fueled anti-western feelings.

" a shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many [Y]ic movements in the post war period "from an initial [Y]ic ideological rejection of saddam hussein, the secular persecutor of [Y]ic movements, and his invasion of kuwait to a more populist arab nation[X]st, anti-imperi[X]st support for saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation.

on the eve of the supreme military council of august 2011, the chief of the general staff, along with the army, navy, and air force commanders, requested their retirement, in protest of the mass arrests which they perceived as a deliberate and planned attack against the kem[X]st and secular-minded officers of the turkish armed forces by the [Y]ists in turkey, who began to control key positions in the turkish government, judiciary and police.

 later, the russian revolution of 1917 would ultimately transform turkmenistan from an [Y]ic tribal society to a tot[X]tarian leninist one during the soviet era.

 currently one of two entities claiming to be the legitimate government of afghanistan, alongside the internationally recognized [Y]ic republic of afghanistan, the t[X]ban have de facto control of the country.

 the t[X]ban's ideology has been described as combining an "innovative" form of sharia [Y]ic law which is based on deobandi fundament[X]sm and militant [Y]ism, combined with pashtun social and cultural norms which are known as pashtunw[X], because most t[X]ban are pashtun tribesmen.

the t[X]ban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the afghan civil war and largely consisted of students () from the pashtun areas of eastern and southern afghanistan who had been educated in traditional [Y]ic schools ().

the t[X]ban have been internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of [Y]ic sharia law, which has resulted in their brutal treatment of many afghans.

the t[X]ban are supported by several militant outfits which include the haqqani network, al-qaeda and the [Y]ic movement of uzbekistan.

 during the soviet–afghan war, nearly all of the t[X]ban's original leaders had fought for either the hezb-i [Y]i kh[X]s or the harakat-i inqilab-e [Y]i factions of the mujahideen.

the t[X]ban are a movement of religious students (t[X]b) from the pashtun areas of eastern and southern afghanistan who were educated in traditional [Y]ic schools.

 the t[X]ban used the american textbooks but they scratched out the images of human faces which were contained in them in keeping with their strict aniconistic and fundament[X]st interpretation of [Y].

the early t[X]ban were motivated by the suffering of the afghan people, which they believed was being caused by the power struggles which were being waged by rival afghan groups which were not adhering to the moral code of [Y]; in their religious schools, they had been taught to believe that they should strictly adhere to [Y]ic law.

 the t[X]ban entered kabul on 27 september 1996 and established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan.

 the t[X]ban sought to establish an [Y]ic government through law and order alongside a strict interpretation of sharia law, in accordance with the hanafi school of [Y]ic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of mullah omar, upon the entire land of afghanistan.

 he stated that the t[X]ban and al-qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of [Y]" and that without the support of pakistan and bin laden the t[X]ban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.

 on 4 october, the t[X]ban agreed to turn bin laden over to pakistan for trial in an international tribunal that operated according to [Y]ic sharia law, but pakistan blocked the offer as it was not possible to guarantee his safety.

 on 7 october, the t[X]ban ambassador to pakistan offered to detain bin laden and try him under [Y]ic law if the us made a formal request and presented the t[X]ban with evidence.

by 2020, after the [Y]ic state of iraq and the levant (isil) had lost almost all of its conquered territory and committed less terrorist acts, the global think tank called the institute for economics & peace considered the t[X]ban to have overtaken isil as the most dangerous terrorist group in the world due to their recent campaigns for territorial expansion.

 the event, attended by 1,600 delegates, took place in june 2010, however the t[X]ban and the hezb-i [Y]i gulbuddin, who were both invited by karzai as a gesture of goodwill did not attend the conference.

the t[X]ban's ideology has been described as an "innovative form of sharia combining pashtun tribal codes", or pashtunw[X], with radical deobandi interpretations of [Y] favoured by jamiat ulema-e-[Y] and its splinter groups.

 the t[X]ban have said they aim to restore peace and security to afghanistan, including western troops leaving, and to enforce sharia, or [Y]ic law, once in power.

according to journ[X]st ahmed rashid, at least in the first years of their rule, the t[X]ban adopted deobandi and [Y]ist anti-nation[X]st beliefs, and they opposed "tribal and feudal structures," removing traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles.

 written works published by the group’s commission of cultural affairs including [Y]i adalat, de mujahid toorah— de jihad shari misalay, and guidance to the mujahideen outlined the core of the t[X]ban [Y]ic movement’s philosophy regarding jihad, sharia, organization, and conduct.

 the t[X]ban regime interpreted the sharia law in accordance with the hanafi school of [Y]ic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of mullah omar.

 however, a few shiite [Y]ists supported t[X]ban rule, such as ustad muhammad akbari.

unlike other [Y]ic fundament[X]st organizations, the t[X]ban is not salafist.

the t[X]ban frequently used the pre-[Y]ic pashtun tribal code, pashtunw[X], in order to make decisions with regard to certain social matters.

 the decision-making process of the t[X]ban in kandahar was modelled on the pashtun tribal council (jirga), together with what was believed to be the early [Y]ic model.

 it is said that the t[X]ban did not include scholars who were learned in [Y]ic law and history.

 malkasian further argues that the t[X]ban's imposing of [Y]ic ideals upon the afghan tribal system was innovative and a key reason for their success and durability.

 in a period of 40 years of constant conflict, the tradition[X]st [Y] of the t[X]ban proved to be far more stable, even if the order they brought was "an impoverished peace".

 after the t[X]ban established the [Y]ic emirate of afghanistan, they imposed strict sharia laws which discriminated against hindus and sikhs and caused the size of afghanistan's hindu and sikh populations to fall at a very rapid rate because they emigrated from afghanistan and established diasporas in the western world.

in august 2010, the t[X]ban claimed that they murdered 10 medical aid workers while they were passing through badakhshan province on their way from kabul to nuristan province — but the afghan [Y]ic party/militia hezb-e [Y]i gulbuddin has also claimed responsibility for those killings.

 however, in may 2013, the t[X]ban's leaders changed their stance on polio vaccinations, saying that the vaccine is the only way to prevent polio and they also stated that they will work with immunization volunteers as long as polio workers are "unbiased" and "harmonized with the regional conditions, [Y]ic values and local cultural traditions.

 however, the t[X]ban imposed restrictions on modern education, banned the education of females, only allowed [Y]ic religious schools to stay open and only encouraged the teaching of the quran.

attacks on educational institutions, students and teachers and the forced enforcement of [Y]ic teachings have even continued after the t[X]ban were deposed from power.

during its time in power (1996–2001), at its height ruling 90% of afghanistan, the t[X]ban regime, or "[Y]ic emirate of afghanistan", gained diplomatic recognition from only three states: the united arab emirates, pakistan, and saudi arabia, all of which provided substantial aid.

many us senior military officials such as robert gates, stanley mcchrystal, david petraeus and others believe that iran's [Y]ic revolutionary guard corps was involved in helping the t[X]ban to a certain extent during the first decade of the twenty-first century.

 the t[X]ban have condemned [Y]ic state-linked attacks on the hazara shia minority.

maulana fazal-ur-rehman, leader of the pakistani [Y]ic (deobandi) political party jamiat ulema-e [Y] (f) (jui), was an ally of benazir bhutto, pakistani prime minister in 1993–1996, and then had access to the pakistani government, army and the isi, whom he influenced to help the t[X]ban.

 us defense secretary robert gates and others suggest the isi maintains links with groups like the afghan t[X]ban as a "strategic hedge" to help [Y]abad gain influence in kabul once us troops exit the region.

 according to the bbc, russia "is deeply concerned about the rise of [Y]ist fundament[X]sm in the region spreading in its direction.

 bin laden, in turn, praised the t[X]ban as the "only [Y]ic government" in existence, and lauded mullah omar for his destruction of idols such as the buddhas of bamyan.

the t[X]ban has a negative relationship with the [Y]ic state – khorasan province.

before the creation of the tehrik-i-t[X]ban (pakistan), also denoted 'tehrik e t[X]ban' some of their leaders and fighters were part of the 8,000 pakistani militants fighting in the war in afghanistan (1996–2001) and the war in afghanistan (2001–present) against the united [Y]ic front and nato forces.

the afghan t[X]ban and the tehrik-i-t[X]ban pakistan differ greatly in their history, leadership and goals although they share a common interpretation of [Y] and are both predominantly pashtun.

 [Y]ic fundament[X]sm

 from the summer of 2007 until late 2009, more than 1,500 people were killed in suicide and other attacks on civilians for reasons attributed to a number of causes—sectarian violence between sunni and shia muslims; easy availability of guns and explosives; the existence of a "kalashnikov culture"; an influx of ideologically driven muslims based in or near pakistan, who originated from various nations around the world and the subsequent war against the pro-soviet afghans in the 1980s which blew back into pakistan; the presence of [Y]ist insurgent groups and forces such as the t[X]ban and lashkar-e-taiba.

 in the middle ages, [Y]ic theologians such as al-ghaz[X] used the argument, although it was rejected as unnecessary by quranic liter[X]sts, and as unconvincing by many [Y]ic philosophers.

 various forms of the argument from design have been used by [Y]ic theologians and philosophers from the time of the early mutakallimun theologians in the 9th century, although it is rejected by fundament[X]st or liter[X]st schools, for whom the mention of god in the qu'ran should be sufficient evidence.

 joined in a call for an independent international investigation of the bloody events at andijan, the relationship further declined, and president [Y] karimov changed the political [X]gnment of the country to bring it closer to russia and china.

the end of soviet control in uzbekistan in 1991 did not bring an immediate upsurge of religion-associated fundament[X]sm, as many had predicted, but rather a gradual re-acquaintance with the precepts of the [Y]ic faith and a gradual resurgence of [Y] in the country.

 the resurgence of central asia: [Y] or nation[X]sm? (2017)

as the abbasid c[X]phate began to weaken and local [Y]ic iranian states emerged as the rulers of iran and central asia, the persian language continued its preeminent role in the region as the language of literature and government.

 however, this move increased uzbek nation[X]sm, which had long resented soviet policies such as the imposition of cotton monoculture and the suppression of [Y]ic traditions.

 president [Y] karimov, the radical nation[X]st group birlik (unity), and the uzbek popular front promoted this change.

 birlik, the original opposition party formed by intellectuals in 1989, was banned for allegedly subversive activities, establishing the karimov regime's dominant ration[X]zation for increased authoritarianism: [Y]ic fundament[X]sm threatened to overthrow the secular state and establish an [Y]ic regime similar to that in iran.

 abdulaziz sachedina observes that muslims broadly agree with the declaration's univers[X]st premise, which is shared by [Y], but differ on specific contents, which many find "insensitive to particular muslim cultural values, especially when it comes to speaking about individual rights in the context of collective and family values in muslim society".

kazakh religion scholars galym zhussipbek and zhanar nagayeva have argued that the rejection or failed implementation of human rights in muslim-majority countries and their seeming incompatibility with sharia law originates from the current "epistemological crisis of conservative [Y]ic scholarship and muslim mind", rooted in the centuries-old confinement of a role for reason within strict limits, and in the disappearance of ration[X]stic discursive theology (kalam) as a dynamic science.

[Y] recognizes to a certain extent the v[X]dity of the abrahamic religions, the quran identifying jews, christians, and "sabi'un" (usually taken as a reference to the mandaeans) as "people of the book" (ahl al-kitab).

 pre-[Y]ic traditions, dating back to alexander's defeat of the persian empire in 330 bc, possibly survived in the form of traditional dances, while literary styles and music reflect influence from the persian tradition and regional musical instruments fused with loc[X]sed variants and interpretation.

 [Y]ic military counter terrorism co[X]tion

 the encyclopaedia of [Y] said the c[X]ph distanced himself from averroes to gain support from more orthodox ulema, who opposed averroes and whose support al-mansur needed for his war against christian kingdoms.

 whereas nomadic berbers were quick to convert to [Y] and assist the arab conquerors, it was not until the twelfth century, under the almohad c[X]phate, that the christian, jewish, and animist communities of the maghreb became margin[X]zed.

the spread of [Y] among the berbers did not guarantee their support for the arab-dominated c[X]phate, due to the discriminatory attitude of the arabs.

huntington argues that the [Y]ic civilization has experienced a massive population explosion which is fueling instability both on the borders of [Y] and in its interior, where fundament[X]st movements are becoming increasingly popular.

more recent factors contributing to a western–[Y]ic clash, huntington wrote, are the [Y]ic resurgence and demographic explosion in [Y], coupled with the values of western univers[X]sm—that is, the view that all civilizations should adopt western values—that infuriate [Y]ic fundament[X]sts.

 he wrote that [Y]ic fundament[X]sm is more of a threat to a global civilization, rather than a confrontation with the west.

 this has been successfully demonstrated by documenting the rise of christianity from the hellenized roman empire, the rise of the [Y]ic c[X]phates from the christianized roman empire and the rise of ottoman rule from the [Y]ic c[X]phates and the christianized roman empire.

in march 1964, malcolm x (el-hajj m[X]k el-shabazz), national representative of the nation of [Y], formally broke with that organization, and made a public offer to collaborate with any civil rights organization that accepted the right to self-defense and the philosophy of black nation[X]sm (which malcolm said no longer required black separatism).

 the [Y]ic c[X]phate later built tar-paved roads in baghdad.

 the peace treaty was also one of the primary factors that led to his assassination; on 6 october 1981, militants led by kh[X]d [Y]bouli opened fire on sadat with automatic rifles during the 6 october parade in cairo, killing him.

 the round up missed a jihad cell in the military led by lieutenant kh[X]d [Y]bouli, who would succeed in assassinating anwar sadat that october.

 survivors of the dynasty established themselves in cordoba which, in the form of an emirate and then a c[X]phate, became a world centre of science, medicine, philosophy and invention during the [Y]ic golden age.

 according to the historian wilferd madelung, this policy stemmed from uthman's "conviction that the house of umayya, as the core clan of quraysh, was uniquely qu[X]fied to rule in the name of [Y]".

 they remained divided, nonetheless, as both cities competed for power and influence in iraq and its eastern dependencies and remained divided between the arab tribal nobility and the early muslim converts, the latter of whom were divided between the pro-[X]ds (loy[X]sts of [X]) and the kharijites, who followed their own strict interpretation of [Y].

 however, in an unprecedented move in [Y]ic politics, mu'awiya nominated his own son, yazid i, as his successor in 676, introducing hereditary rule to c[X]phal succession and, in practice, turning the office of the c[X]ph into a kingship.

the next major challenge to yazid's rule emanated from the hejaz where abd allah ibn al-zubayr, the son of al-zubayr ibn al-awwam and grandson of abu bakr, advocated for a shura among the quraysh to elect the c[X]ph and rallied opposition to the umayyads from his headquarters in [Y]'s holiest sanctuary, the ka'aba in mecca.

to consolidate umayyad rule after the second fitna, the marwanids launched a series of centr[X]zation, [Y]ization and arabization measures.

 indeed, it formed an important part of the [Y]ization measures that lent the umayyad c[X]phate "a more ideological and programmatic coloring it had previously lacked", according to blankinship.

in 691/92, abd al-m[X]k completed the dome of the rock in jerusalem, it was possibly intended as a monument of victory over the christians that would distinguish [Y]'s uniqueness within the common abrahamic setting of jerusalem, home of the two older abrahamic faiths, judaism and christianity.

 he is the only umayyad ruler to have been recognized by subsequent [Y]ic tradition as a genuine c[X]ph (kh[X]fa) and not merely as a worldly king (m[X]k).

 it is not clear how umar attempted to resolve this situation, but the sources portray him as having insisted on like treatment of arab and non-arab (maw[X]) muslims, and on the removal of obstacles to the conversion of non-arabs to [Y].

in the early period of [Y], justice was administered by muhammad and the orthodox c[X]phs in person.

 therefore, they held to a less univers[X]st conception of [Y] than did many of their rivals.

 however, the umayyad c[X]phs do seem to have understood themselves as the representatives of god on earth, and to have been responsible for the "definition and elaboration of god's ordinances, or in other words the definition or elaboration of [Y]ic law.

the umayyads have met with a largely negative reception from later [Y]ic historians, who have accused them of promoting a kingship (mulk, a term with connotations of tyranny) instead of a true c[X]phate (khilafa).

 in his efforts to spread [Y], he established liberties for the maw[X] by abolishing the jizya tax for converts to [Y].

 in shia sources, the umayyad c[X]phate is widely described as "tyrannical, anti-[Y]ic and godless".

the abbasid c[X]phate ( or  , ) was the third c[X]phate to succeed the [Y]ic prophet muhammad.

 although abbasid leadership over the vast [Y]ic empire was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function in much of the c[X]phate, the dynasty retained control of its mesopotamian domain during the rule of c[X]ph al-muqtafi and extended into iran during the reign of c[X]ph al-nasir.

 in 929, abd ar-rahman iii assumed the title of c[X]ph, establishing al andalus from córdoba as a rival to baghdad as the legitimate capital of the [Y]ic empire.

 by 1000 they had become the chief political and ideological challenge to sunni [Y] and the abbasids, who by this time had fragmented into several governorships that, while recognizing c[X]phal authority from baghdad, remained mostly autonomous.

 in the 11th century, the loss of respect for the c[X]phs continued, as some [Y]ic rulers no longer mentioned the c[X]ph's name in the friday khutba, or struck it off their coinage.

once again, the abbasids were forced to deal with a military power that they could not match, though the abbasid c[X]ph remained the titular head of the [Y]ic community.

 during the 13th century, this mongol empire conquered most of the eurasian land mass, including both china in the east and much of the old [Y]ic c[X]phate (as well as kievan rus') in the west.

 past having a casual association or just being a secretary to high-ranking [Y]ic officials, some of them achieved the second highest office after the c[X]ph: the vizier.

 some muslims in the c[X]phate took offense to the idea that there were dhimmis in public offices who were in a way ruling over them although it was an [Y]ic state, while other muslims were at time jealous of some dhimmis for having a level of wealth or prestige greater than other muslims, even if muslims were still the majority of the ruling class.

the abbasid c[X]phate differed from others in that it did not have the same borders and extent as [Y].

the almohad ideology preached by ibn tumart is described by amira bennison as a "sophisticated hybrid form of [Y] that wove together strands from hadith science, zahiri and shafi'i fiqh, ghaz[X]an social actions (hisba), and spiritual engagement with shi'i notions of the imam and mahdi".

 this contrasted with the highly orthodox or tradition[X]st m[X]ki school (maddhab) of sunni [Y] which predominated in the region up to that point.

in terms of [Y]ic theology, the almohads were ash'arites, their zahirite-ash'arism giving rise to a complicated blend of liter[X]st jurisprudence and esoteric dogmatics.

 although ibn rushd (who was also an [Y]ic judge) saw ration[X]sm and philosophy as complimentary to religion and revelation, his views failed to convince the traditional m[X]ki ulema, with whom the almohads were already at odds.

the french historian henri terrasse described al-qarawiyyin's bronze grand chandelier, commissioned by c[X]ph muhammad al-nasir, as "the largest and most beautiful chandelier in the [Y]ic world.

throughout tunisia's history many peoples have arrived among the berbers to settle: most recently the french along with many it[X]ans, before them came the ottoman turks with their multi-ethnic rule, yet earlier the arabs who brought their language and the religion of [Y], and its calendar; before them arrived the byzantines, and the vandals.

, while the ulama in the rest of [Y] adopted for the most part either the hanafi or the shafi'i school of law, the berbers in the west chose the m[X]ki madhhab, developing it in the course of time after their own fashion.

 another issue was aghlabid taxation not sanctioned by the m[X]ki school of [Y]ic law.

 other opponents criticized their contemptuous treatment of maw[X] berbers who had embraced [Y].

 the [Y]ic doctrine of equ[X]ty regardless of race was a cornerstone of the sunni movement in the maghrib, and also of the m[X]ki school of law as developed in kairouan; these principles formed the core of the hostility of ifriqiya toward rule from the east by the c[X]ph.

" [X]'s friendship with malcolm x ended as malcolm split with the nation of [Y] a couple of weeks after [X] joined, and [X] remained with the nation of [Y].

[X]gning himself with the nation of [Y], its leader elijah muhammad, and a narrative that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against african americans made [X] a target of public condemnation.

 the nation of [Y] was widely viewed by whites and some african americans as a black separatist "hate religion" with a propensity toward violence; [X] had few qualms about using his influential voice to speak nation of [Y] doctrine.

in a 2004 autobiography, [X] attributed his conversion to mainstream sunni [Y] to warith deen muhammad, who assumed leadership of the nation of [Y] upon the death of his father elijah muhammad, and persuaded the nation's followers to become adherents of sunni [Y].

 gianotti, who was at [X]'s bedside during his last days and ensured that although his funeral was interfaith, it was still in accordance with [Y]ic rites and rituals.

 after aristotle's death, western ration[X]stic thought was generally characterized by its application to theology, such as in the works of augustine, the [Y]ic philosopher avicenna (ibn sina), averroes (ibn rushd), and jewish philosopher and theologian maimonides.

[X] khamenei –who was addressed with mid-level title of hujjat al-[Y] when he was in office as president– was bestowed the title ayatollah immediately after he became supreme leader of iran in 1989, without meeting regular unwritten criteria (such as authoring a risalah).

 he met with the sultan m[X]k al-kamil, initiating a spirit of dialogue and understanding between christianity and [Y].

in the 7th century, when many non-arabs such as persians entered [Y], they were recognized as maw[X] ("clients") and treated as second-class citizens by the ruling arab elite until the end of the umayyad c[X]phate.

 during this era, [Y] was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the arab and required formal association with an arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of maw[X].

with the death of the umayyad c[X]ph hisham ibn abd al-m[X]k in 743, the [Y]ic world was launched into civil war.

 citing as its basis [Y]ic notions of equ[X]ty of races and nations, the movement was primarily concerned with preserving persian culture and protecting persian identity, though within a muslim context.

the most important scholars of almost all of the [Y]ic sects and schools of thought were persian or lived in iran, including the most notable and reliable hadith collectors of shia and sunni like shaikh saduq, shaikh kulainy, hakim al-nishaburi, imam muslim and imam bukhari, the greatest theologians of shia and sunni like shaykh tusi, imam ghaz[X], imam fakhr al-razi and al-zamakhshari, the greatest physicians, astronomers, logicians, mathematicians, metaphysicians, philosophers and scientists like avicenna, and nasīr al-dīn al-tūsī, the greatest shaykh of sufism like rumi, abdul-qadir gilani.

 they brought abu hamid ghaz[X], one of the greatest [Y]ic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the seljuq capital at baghdad and encouraged and supported their work.

 however, the reforms, including the white revolution, did not greatly improve economic conditions and the liberal pro-western policies [X]enated certain [Y]ic religious and political groups.

the ideology of the revolutionary government was populist, nation[X]st and most of all shi'a [Y]ic.

iran's rapidly modernising, capit[X]st economy was replaced by populist and [Y]ic economic and cultural policies.

 much industry was nation[X]zed, laws and schools [Y]icized, and western influences banned.

 in the non-muslim world it has changed the image of [Y], generating much interest in the politics and spiritu[X]ty of [Y], along with "fear and distrust towards [Y]" and particularly the [Y]ic republic and its founder.

 he sought to restore confidence in the government among the general population by privatizing the companies that had been nation[X]zed in the first few years of the [Y]ic republic, as well as by bringing in qu[X]fied technocrats to manage the economy.

 supreme leader [X] khamenei and other [Y]ic officials blamed foreign powers for fomenting the protest.

al-ghaz[X] in the 11th century discussed concupiscence from an [Y]ic perspective in his book kimiya-yi sa'ādat (the alchemy of happiness), and also mentioned it in the deliverer from error.

kazi nazrul [Y] (1899–1976), beng[X] poet, musician and revolutionary

 al-ghaz[X], for example, argued that while the c[X]ph was the guarantor of [Y]ic law (shari'a), coercive power was required to enforce the law in practice and the leader who exercised that power directly was the sultan.

 at the end of war seeing their place in power solidified with the surpression of leftist, monarchists and nation[X]sts the [Y]ic republic  supporters dissolved the [Y]ic republic party and reorganised themselves as princip[X]sts and reformists becoming the only two group's that can participate in elections.

  there have been only two supreme leaders since the founding of the [Y]ic republic, and the current leader ([X] khamenei), has been in power since 1989.

groups that generally support the [Y]ic republic include ansar-e hizballah, the iranian [Y]ic students association, muslim students following the line of the imam, [Y]'s students, and the [Y]ic co[X]tion association.

 since then the country's policies have oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour to eliminate western and non-muslim influences while promoting the [Y]ic revolution abroad, and pragmatism, which would advance economic development and norm[X]zation of relations.

these groups came under the umbrella of the "council for the [Y]ic revolution", which was supervised by ayatollah hussein [X] montazeri, the designated heir of ayatollah khomeini.

its strategy was two-pronged: armed struggle against what were perceived as western imperi[X]sm and its agents; and an internal purifying process to free [Y]ic territory and muslim minds of non-[Y]ic cultural, intellectual and spiritual influences, by providing justice, services, resources to the mustazafin (weak) masses of the muslim world.

 for example, the [Y]ic republic expressed its opinion of egypt's secular government by naming a street in tehran after egyptian president anwar sadat's killer, kh[X]d al-istanbuli.

 from this point on, the [Y]ic republic recognized that it had no choice but to moderate its radical approach and ration[X]ze its objectives.

 this includes a strong commitment to the organisation of [Y]ic cooperation (oic) and the non-[X]gned movement.

  the main aim of giving up things of the materi[X]stic world is to withdraw oneself from sensual pleasures (as they are considered illusionary and only temporary in some religions—such as the concept of dunya in [Y]).

deobandi is an [Y]ic reviv[X]st movement within sunni (primarily hanafi) [Y] that formed during the late 19th century around the darul uloom [Y]ic seminary in the town of deoband, india, from which the name derives.

 founders of the deobandi school muhammad qasim nanautavi and rashid ahmad gangohi drew inspiration from the religio-political doctrines of the prominent south asian [Y]ic scholar and sufi reformer shah w[X]ullah dehlawi ( 1703-1762 c.

 the darul uloom deoband has consistently supported the civil actions of the t[X]ban, but repeatedly condemned [Y]ic terrorism in the 2000s, issuing a fatwa against it in 2008.

british coloni[X]sm in india was seen by a group of indian scholars—consisting of rashid ahmad gangohi, muhammad yaqub nanautawi, shah rafi al-din, sayyid muhammad abid, zulfiqar [X], fazlur rahman usmani and muhammad qasim nanotvi—to be corrupting [Y].

 the group founded an [Y]ic seminary (madrassa) known as darul uloom deoband, where the [Y]ic reviv[X]st and anti-imperi[X]st ideology of the deobandis began to develop.

 a group later dissented from this position and joined muhammad [X] jinnah's muslim league, including ashraf [X] thanwi, shabbir ahmad usmani, zafar ahmad usmani and muhammad shafi deobandi, who formed the jamiat ulema-e-[Y] in 1945.

 the same investigative report further said that 17 of the country's 26 [Y]ic seminaries follow the ultra-conservative deobandi teachings which the times said had given birth to the t[X]ban.

the deobandi movement sees itself as a scholastic tradition that grew out of the [Y]ic scholastic traditions of medieval transoxania and mughal india, and it considers its visionary forefather to be shah w[X]ullah dehlawi (1703-1762).

 muhammad ibn 'abd al-wahhab established the wahhabi movement, while shah w[X]ullah's reform endeavours would inspire the deobandi, ahl-i hadith and jamaat-e-[Y]i movements.

deobandi scholars also consider ash'ari and athari traditions as v[X]d schools in sunni [Y].

the t[X]ban ("students"), alternative spelling taleban, is an [Y]ic fundament[X]st political and militant movement in afghanistan.

 while many leading muslims and [Y]ic scholars have been highly critical of the t[X]ban's interpretations of [Y]ic law, the darul uloom deoband has consistently supported the t[X]ban in afghanistan, including their 2001 destruction of the buddhas of bamiyan, and the majority of the t[X]ban's leaders were influenced by deobandi fundament[X]sm.

tehrik-i-t[X]ban pakistan (the ttp), alternatively referred to as the pakistani t[X]ban, is an umbrella organization of various [Y]ist militant groups based in the northwestern federally administered tribal areas along the afghan border in pakistan.

the ttp is not directly affiliated with the afghan t[X]ban movement led by mullah omar, with both groups differing greatly in their histories, strategic goals and interests although they both share a primarily deobandi interpretation of [Y] and are predominantly pashtun.

 the reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include: the grave internal situation and inability for the afghan government; the effects of the iranian revolution that brought an [Y]ic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through afghanistan and into soviet muslim central asian republics; taraki's murder and replacement by amin, who the soviets feared could become [X]gned with the americans and provide them with a new strategic position after the loss of iran; and the deteriorating ties with the united states after nato's two-track missile deployment decision and the failure of congress to ratify the salt ii treaty, creating the impression that détente was "already effectively dead.

 according to scholars such as patrick peebles and others, during a period of religious turmoil and [Y]ic rule of the indian subcontinent, the bhakti movement and devotion[X]sm-oriented bhakti yoga had emerged as a major trend in hindu culture by the 16th-century, and the ramcharitmanas presented rama as a vishnu avatar, supreme being and a personal god worthy of devotion, with hanuman as the ideal loving devotee with legendary courage, strength and powers.

 according to some scholars, the hanuman-linked youth organizations have tended to have a paramilitary wing and have opposed other religions, with a mission of resisting the "evil eyes of [Y], christianity and communism", or as a symbol of hindu nation[X]sm.

 the most consequential of abd al-m[X]k's reforms were the introduction of a single [Y]ic currency in place of byzantine and sasanian coinage and the establishment of arabic as the language of the bureaucracy in place of greek and persian in syria and iraq, respectively.

 his muslim upbringing, the conflicts with external and local christian forces and rival claimants to [Y]ic leadership all influenced abd al-m[X]k's efforts to prescribe a distinctly [Y]ic character to the umayyad state.

 abd al-m[X]k belonged to the first generation of born-muslims and his upbringing in medina, [Y]'s political center at the time, was generally described as pious and rigorous by the traditional muslim sources.

 robinson, "mu'awiya may have introduced the principle of dynastic succession into the ruling tradition of early [Y], but abd al-m[X]k made it work".

a major component of abd al-m[X]k's centr[X]zation and [Y]ization measures was the institution of an [Y]ic currency.

 indeed, it formed an important part of the [Y]ization measures that lent the umayyad c[X]phate "a more ideological and programmatic coloring it had previously lacked", according to blankinship.

 in tandem, abd al-m[X]k began the export of papyri containing the muslim statement of belief in greek to spread [Y]ic teachings in the byzantine realm.

the increasingly muslim character of the state under abd al-m[X]k was partly a reflection of [Y]'s influence in the lives of the c[X]ph and the chief enforcer of his policies, al-hajjaj, both of whom belonged to the first generation of rulers born and raised as muslims.

 having spent most of their lives in the hejaz, the theological and legal center of [Y] where arabic was spoken exclusively and administrative offices were held solely by arab muslims, abd al-m[X]k and his viceroy only understood arabic and were unfamiliar with the syrian and greek christian and persian zoroastrian officials of the .

 thus, one series of explanations was that abd al-m[X]k intended for the dome of the rock to be a religious monument of victory over the christians that would distinguish [Y]'s uniqueness within the common abrahamic religious setting of jerusalem, home of the two older abrahamic faiths, judaism and christianity.

 abd al-m[X]k also married a'isha bint musa, a granddaughter of one of the [Y]ic prophet muhammad's leading companions, talha ibn ubayd allah, and together they had a son, bakkar, who was also known as abu bakr.

radical [Y], trib[X]sm, and the "clash of civilizations"

various western commentators have described the thesis of the end of history as flawed because it does not sufficiently take into account the power of ethnic loyalties and religious fundament[X]sm as a counter-force to the spread of liberal democracy, with the specific example of [Y]ic fundament[X]sm, or radical [Y], as the most powerful of these.

al-ghaz[X] (, ; full name  or , ; latinized algazelus or algazel;  – 19 december 1111), known in persian-speaking countries as imam muhammad-i ghaz[X] (persian: امام محمد غزالی), was a persian polymath, who was one of the most prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, logicians and mystics of [Y].

 his works were so highly acclaimed by his contemporaries that al-ghaz[X] was awarded the honorific title "proof of [Y]" (hujjat al-islām).

al-ghaz[X] believed that the [Y]ic spiritual tradition had become moribund and that the spiritual sciences taught by the first generation of muslims had been forgotten.

 al-ghaz[X]'s contemporary and first biographer, 'abd al-ghafir al-farisi, records merely that al-ghaz[X] began to receive instruction in fiqh ([Y]ic jurisprudence) from ahmad al-radhakani, a local teacher and abu [X] farmadi, a sufi from tus.

al-ghaz[X] contributed significantly to the development of a systematic view of sufism and its integration and acceptance in mainstream [Y].

in the next century, averroes drafted a lengthy rebuttal of al-ghaz[X]'s incoherence entitled the incoherence of the incoherence; however, the epistemological course of [Y]ic thought had already been set.

on the other hand, author and journ[X]st hassan hassan in 2012 argued that while indeed scientific thought in [Y] was stifled in the 11th century, the person mostly to blame is not al-ghaz[X] but nizam al-mulk.

 it's also important to note here that ghaz[X] draws from greek as well as [Y]ic philosophy in crafting this literary staple, even though much of the incoherence of the philosophers, his most well known work, takes a critical aim at their perspective.

al-ghaz[X] lays out in the decisive criterion for distinguishing [Y] from clandestine unbelief his approach to muslim orthodoxy.

 ghaz[X] veers from the often hardline stance of many of his contemporaries during this time period and states that as long as one believes in the prophet muhammad and god himself, there are many different ways to practice [Y] and that any of the many traditions practiced in good faith by believers should not be viewed as heretical by other muslims.

 while ghaz[X] does state that any muslim practicing [Y] in good faith is not guilty of apostasy, he does outline in the criterion that there is one standard of [Y] that is more correct than the others, and that those practicing the faith incorrectly should be moved to change.

 in ghaz[X]'s view, only the prophet himself could deem a faithfully practicing muslim an infidel, and his work was a reaction to the religious persecution and strife that occurred often during this time period between various [Y]ic sects.

faza'il al-anam min rasa'il hujjat al-[Y] is the collection of letters in persian that al-ghaz[X] wrote in response to the kings, ministers, jurists and some of his friends after he returned to khorasan.

 al-ghaz[X] distributed his book the incoherence of philosophers, set apart as the defining moment in [Y]ic epistemology.

the period following ghaz[X] "has tentatively been called the golden age of arabic philosophy" initiated by ghaz[X]'s successful integration of logic into the [Y]ic seminary madrasah curriculum.

  three of his works, ihaya' ulum ad-din (revival of religious sciences), tahafut al-falasifa (the incoherence of philosophers), and al-muniqidh min a-alal (al-ghaz[X]'s path to sufism: his deliverance from error) are still widely read and circulated among [Y]ic scholars today.

  after the death of al-ghaz[X], it is believed there followed a long era in which there was a notable absence of [Y]ic philosophers, contributing to the status of ghaz[X] in the modern era.

  al-ghaz[X]'s influence was not limited to [Y], but in fact his works were widely circulated among christian and hebrew scholars and philosophers.

  one of the more notable achievements of ghaz[X] were his writing and reform of education that laid the path of [Y]ic education from the 12th to the 19th centuries.

  al-ghaz[X]'s works were heavily relied upon by [Y]ic mathematicians and astronomers such as at-tusi.

in the contemporary world, al-ghaz[X] is renowned not only for his contribution to sufism, [Y], philosophy, or education but his work and ethical approach transcends another boundary into the [Y]ic business practice.

  in the journal of business ethics, authors yusif sidani and akram al ariss explain how [Y]ic business ethics are governed by the writings of abu-hamid al-ghaz[X] and even posit that al-ghaz[X] is the greatest muslim since the prophet muhammad.

  traditional [Y]ist's are influenced by ghaz[X]'s writings since he was indebted to writing about and incorporating sharia law.

also a widely considered sunni scholar, al dhahabi in, his praise of al ghaz[X], wrote: “al-ghazza[X], the imaam and shaykh, the prominent scholar, hujjat al-[Y], the wonder of his time, zayn al-deen abu haamid muhammad ibn muhammad ibn muhammad ibn ahmad al-toosi al-shaafa’i al-ghazza[X], the author of many books and one possessed of utter intelligence.

al-ghaz[X] has been seen by orient[X]st scholars as causing a decline in scientific advancement in [Y], because of his refutation of the new philosophies of his time.

 the following statement made by al ghaz[X] has been described as evidence that he was not against scientific advancement: "great indeed is the crime against religion committed by anyone who supposes that [Y] is to be championed by the denial of mathematical sciences"

most aspects of al-ghaz[X]'s life were heavily influenced by his [Y]ic beliefs, and his economic philosophy was no exception.

al-ghaz[X] thought that it should not be necessary to force equ[X]ty of income in society but that people should be driven by "the spirit of [Y]ic brotherhood" to share their wealth willingly, but he recognized that it is not always the case.

she was a mawla of the ansar tribe, which mean she was a freedwoman-client who converted to [Y], which was the usual background for free professional musical artists in the c[X]phate.

 for example, the threat of communism, soci[X]sm, and [Y]ism was often used.

the industry has been lauded for returning to the path of "divine guidance" in rejecting  the "political and economic dominance" of the west, and noted as the "most visible mark" of [Y]ic reviv[X]sm, its most enthusiastic advocates promise  "no inflation, no unemployment, no exploitation and no poverty" once it is fully implemented.

according to [Y]ic economists choudhury and m[X]k, the elimination of interest followed a "gradual process" in early [Y], "culminating" with a "fully fledged [Y]ic economic system" under c[X]ph umar (634–644 ce).

however, in the 20th century, [Y]ic reviv[X]sts/[Y]ists/activists worked to define all interest as riba, to enjoin muslims to lend and borrow at "[Y]ic banks" that avoided fixed rates.

 others (muhammad akran khan) have questioned whether riba is a crime like murder and theft, forbidden by sharia ([Y]ic law) and subject to punishment by human beings, or simply a sin to be inveighed against, with the reprimand left to god, since "neither the prophet nor the first four c[X]phs nor any subsequent [Y]ic government ever enacted any law against riba.

while reviv[X]sts like mohammed naveed insist [Y]ic banking is "as old as the religion itself with its principles primarily derived from the quran", secular historians and [Y]ic modernists see it as a modern phenomenon or "invented tradition".

an early market economy and an early form of mercantilism, sometimes called [Y]ic capit[X]sm, was developed between the eighth and twelfth centuries.

 the profit-sharing experiment, in the nile delta town of mit ghamr, did not specifically advertise its [Y]ic nature for fear of being seen as a manifestation of [Y]ic fundament[X]sm that was anathema to the gamal nasser regime.

 mohammed ariff also found less exacting sharia-compliance in iran where the [Y]ic government had decreed "that government borrowing on the basis of a fixed rate of return from the nation[X]zed banking system would not amount to interest" and consequently would be permissible.

some proponents (nizam yaquby) believe [Y]ic banking has more far reaching purposes than conventional banking, and declare that the "guiding principles" for [Y]ic finance include: "fairness, justice, equ[X]ty, transparency, and the pursuit of social harmony", although others describe these virtues as the natural benefits of following sharia.

nizam yaquby, for example declares that the "guiding principles" for [Y]ic finance include: "fairness, justice, equ[X]ty, transparency, and the pursuit of social harmony".

however, since [Y]ic banking also calls for rewarding delayed gratification in the form of "return on investment" on both profit-sharing and credit sales, [Y]ic scholars and economists have tended to insist that time value of money is a v[X]d concept "provided the rate of discount is the 'rate of return' on capital rather than the rate of interest," a position critics find specious.

on the other hand, at least one [Y]ic scholar (mohammed hashim kam[X]) finds "nothing inherently objectionable" in selling and using options, which like other kinds of trade is mubah (permissible) in fiqh, and "simply an extension of the basic liberty that the quran has granted".

 the scarcity of qu[X]fied shariah supervisors – who need to be trained in both [Y]ic commercial law and contemporary financial practices – has been noted.

the clash between the large demand by pious muslims for [Y]ic financial products and practices, and the impractic[X]ty/inefficiency of the [Y]ic products and practices proposed by [Y]ic finance evangelists, resolved by use of highly paid (but scarce) scholars "willing to certify conventional instruments as being shariah-compliant", and the adding of an additional layer of transaction costs on those products (feisal khan).

[Y]ic scholar mohammad hashim kam[X], laments the focus on short-term financing by [Y]ic banks.

 in 1988 the [Y]ic investment house, ar-ryan collapsed causing thousands of small investors to lose their savings (they were later reimbursed for their losses by an anonymous gulf state donor) and de[X]ng a blow to [Y]ic finance at the time.

" regional [Y]ic banks in the middle east and malaysia did not have "speci[X]zed personnel trained to understand and negotiate sharia-compliant treasury swaps" and were not willing to hire the consultants who did.

studies of [Y]ic banking customer in malaysia and pakistan found customer satisfaction was connected to service qu[X]ty.

while the veracity of the second explanation can not be verified before a complete [Y]ic society is established, feisal khan points in regard to the first defense that it has been over twenty years (1993) since one critic (timur kuran) first highlighted the industry problems (the basic similarity of [Y]ic banking in practice to the conventional, the margin[X]zing of the equity-based, risk-sharing modes and embrace of short-term products and debt-like instruments), and since a supporter (ausaf ahmad) defended the industry as early in its transition from conventional banking.

punishment may also be applied on moral, especially religious, grounds, as in penance (which is voluntary) or imposed in a theocracy with a religious police (as in a strict [Y]ic state like iran or under the t[X]ban) or (though not a true theocracy) by inquisition.

wahhabism () is a term used to refer to the [Y]ic reviv[X]st and fundament[X]st movement within sunni [Y] which is associated with the hanb[X] reformist doctrines of the arabian scholar muhammad ibn ʿabd al-wahhab (1703-1792).

 "a sect dominant in saudi arabia and qatar" with footholds in "india, africa, and elsewhere", with a "steadfastly fundament[X]st interpretation of [Y] in the tradition of ibn hanbal" (cyril glasse)

 an "eighteenth-century reformist/reviv[X]st movement for sociomoral reconstruction of society", "founded by muhammad ibn 'abd al-wahhab" (oxford dictionary of [Y]).

 according to him, labelling the exponents of tawhid as "wahhabi" was wrong since it symbolised a form of region[X]sm that went against [Y]ic univers[X]sm.

 by the late 1990s, the "wahhabi" label would become the most common term to refer to the "[Y]ic menace", while "sufism" was invoked as a "moderate" force that balanced the "radic[X]sm" of wahhabis.

 a new york times journ[X]st writes that saudis "abhor" the term wahhabism, "feeling it sets them apart and contradicts the notion that [Y] is a monolithic faith".

salafiyya movement (term derived from "salaf al-s[X]h", meaning "pious predecessors of the first three generations") refers to a wide range of reform movements within sunni [Y] across the world, that campaigns for the return of "pure" [Y], revival of the prophetic sunnah, and the practices of the early generations of [Y]ic scholars.

according to joas wagemakers, associate professor of [Y]ic and arabic studies at utrecht university, salafism consists of broad movements of muslims across the world who aspire to live according to the precedents of the salaf al-s[X]h; whereas "wahhabism" - a term rejected by its adherents - refers to the specific brand of reformation (islah) campaign that was initiated by the 18th-century scholar muhammad ibn ʿabd al-wahhab and evolved through his subsequent disciples in the central arabian region of najd.

 this moneyspent on books, media, schools, universities, mosques, scholarships, fellowships, lucrative jobs for journ[X]sts, academics and [Y]ic scholarsgave wahhabism a "preeminent position of strength" in [Y] around the world.

 in the late 1800s, wahhabis found muslims with at least similar beliefsfirst with ahl-i hadith in south asia, and later with [Y]ic reviv[X]sts in arab states (one being mahmud sahiri al-alusi in baghdad).

 reviving the fundament[X]st teachings of classical hanb[X] theologians ibn taymiyya and ibn qayyim, rida also advocated the political restoration of an [Y]ic c[X]phate that would unite the muslim ummah as necessary for maintaining a virtous [Y]ic society.

 was the "infiltration of the transnation[X]st revival movement" in the form of thousands of pious, [Y]ist arab muslim brotherhood refugees from egypt following nasser's clampdown on the brotherhood (and also from similar nation[X]st clampdowns in iraq and syria), to help staff the new school system of the (largely illiterate) kingdom.

a number of reasons have been given for this success: the growth in popularity and strength of both arab nation[X]sm (although wahhabis opposed any form of nation[X]sm as an ideology, saudis were arabs, and their enemy the ottoman c[X]phate was ethnically turkish), and [Y]ic reform (specifically reform by following the example of those first three generations of muslims known as the salaf); the destruction of the ottoman empire which sponsored their most effective critics; the destruction of another rival, the khilafa in hejaz, in 1925.

 tens of billions of us dollars of this money were spent on books, media, schools, scholarships for students (from primary to post-graduate), fellowships and subsidies to reward journ[X]sts, academics and [Y]ic scholars, the building of hundreds of [Y]ic centers and universities, and over one thousand schools and one thousand mosques.

 but many jihad volunteers (most famously osama bin laden) returning home to saudi arabia and elsewhere were often radic[X]zed by [Y]ic militants who were "much more extreme than their saudi sponsors".

 the king also expanded the council of senior scholars (containing officially approved religious scholars) to include scholars from sunni schools of [Y]ic jurisprudence other than the hanb[X] madh'habshafi'i, hanafi and m[X]ki schools.

 suggesting a possible coordination between the two nations on religious reforms, few days after the interview of mbs, grand imam of al-azhar, ahmed el-tayeb called for a "religious renewal", stating: "constant renewal ensures that [Y] remain a vital and dynamic religion that spreads justice and equ[X]ty among people.

the wahhabi movement was part of the overall current of various [Y]ic reviv[X]st trends in the 18th century.

 it would be influenced by and in turn, influence many other [Y]ic reform-reviv[X]st movements across the globe.

as a religious reviv[X]st movement that works to bring muslims back from what it considers as foreign accretions that have corrupted [Y], and believes that [Y] is a complete way of life which has prescriptions for all aspects of life, wahhabism is quite strict in what it considers [Y]ic behavior.

 according to the american journ[X]st lawrence wright, due to wahhabi emphasis on the "purification of [Y]"; the teaching becomes very repressive to the followers.

 ibn 'atiq established correspondence with athari scholars like siddiq hasan khan, an influential scholar of the ahl al-hadith movement in the [Y]ic princip[X]ty of bhopal.

 thus, various wahhabi scholars began making efforts to appropriate ibn 'abd al-wahhab's legacy into mainstream sunni [Y] by appropriating them to the broader tradition[X]st scholarship active across the indian subcontinent, iraq, syria, egypt, yemen, etc.

 despite their conceptual doctrine based on repudiation of taqlid (emulating legal precedent) to a legal school and jettisoning the juristic super-structure that developed after the [Y]ic fourth century; in-order to lower clerical resistance to their campaign; wahhabis sustained the local juristic tradition of najd, which was based on hanb[X]sm.

 however wahhabi preachers are conservative and do not deal with concepts such as social justice, anticoloni[X]sm, or economic equ[X]ty, expounded upon by [Y]ist muslims.

 wahhabi calls for a return to the pristine [Y] of the salaf al-s[X]h (righteous predecessors) which rejected much of the classical legal precedents; instead deriving directly from qur'an, hadith and the sayings of the salaf; through ijtihad.

 it rewarded journ[X]sts and academics, who followed it and built satellite campuses around egypt for al azhar, the oldest and most influential [Y]ic university.

 almost every fundament[X]st movement in sunni [Y] has been strongly influenced by qutb, so there is a good case for calling the violence that some of his followers commit "qutbian terrorism".

more recently, the self-declared "[Y]ic state" in iraq and syria headed by abu bakr al-baghdadi has been described as both more violent than al-qaeda and more closely [X]gned with wahhabism, alongside salafism and salafi jihadism.

 while historically wahhabis were not champions of a c[X]phate, the [Y]ic state borrowed the idea of restoration of a global c[X]phate.

according to the american scholar cole bunzel, arabist and historian speci[X]zed in near eastern studies, "the religious character of the [Y]ic state is, without doubt, overwhelmingly wahhabi, but the group does depart from wahhabi tradition in four critical respects: dynastic alliance, the c[X]phate, violence, and apocalyptic fervor".

 the pan-[Y]ist call for a global c[X]phate is another departure from wahhabism.

 the khilafah (c[X]phate), understood in shari'ah ([Y]ic law) as the ideal [Y]ic polity uniting all muslim territories, does not figure much in traditional wahhabi writings.

" pakistan's united states envoy, ambassador [X], promised a "full inquiry" into how pakistani intelligence services could have failed to find bin laden in a fortified compound so close to [Y]abad.

[X] argues that bhutto chose zia ahead of many senior officers for ethnic and caste reasons, thinking than an arain would not make alliance with the predominantly pashtun and rajput military officers in order to overthrow him, and this is also the reason why he let zia push for more [Y] in the armed forces, like when he changed the army's credo to “iman, taqwa, jihad fi sabil allah” or when he offered books of mawdudi to his officers as prizes during various competitions, despite the strong ideological antagonism between bhutto and the [Y]ist thinker.

[X] has described [Y]ist extremism as "the single most dangerous idea that has emerged in the muslim world".

after [X] announced his conversion to [Y] in 1979, he released three albums widely cited as being based on his newfound faith.

 this book, which has been written about in many dylan blogs, is a reassessment of [X]'s musical career that focuses on dylan's mid-life conversion to [Y].

dylan expert michael gray, author of the [X] encyclopedia, commented that "changing of the guards" is a thorough description of dylan's personal journey, from the beginning of his musical career, about sixteen years prior (the opening line is "sixteen years"), through his marriage to and divorce from sara dylan, up to his conversion to [Y], which was announced soon after the song's release, although gray also accused some passages of being "opaque".

an essay on [Y] and modern times by andrew mccarron, published in the book the world of [X] in 2021, discuses "ain't talkin'" as exemplifying the difficulty of living a morally upright life: "proverbs 21 states 'whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor'.
