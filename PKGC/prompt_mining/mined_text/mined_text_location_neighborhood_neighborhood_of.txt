[Y]'s [X] () is a neighborhood in lower [Y], new york city, bordering the lower east side to its east, little italy to its north, civic center to its south, and tribeca to its west.

 [Y]'s [X] is also one of the oldest chinese ethnic enclaves.

 the [Y] [X] is one of nine [X] neighborhoods in new york city, as well as one of twelve in the new york metropolitan area, which contains the largest ethnic chinese population outside of asia, comprising an estimated 893,697 uniracial individuals as of 2017.

 however, in the 1980s and 1990s, large numbers of fuzhounese-speaking immigrants also arrived and formed a sub-neighborhood annexed to the eastern portion of [X] east of the bowery, which has become known as little fuzhou (小福州) subdivided away from the primarily cantonese populated original long time established [X] of [Y] from the proximity of the bowery going west, known as little hong kong/guangdong (小粵港).

 although now overtaken in size by the rapidly growing flushing [X] (法拉盛華埠) (located in the new york city borough of queens) and brooklyn [X] (布魯克林華埠), the [Y] [X] remains a dominant cultural force for the chinese diaspora, as home to the museum of chinese in america and as the headquarters of numerous publications based both in the u.

[X] is part of [Y] community district 3, and its primary zip codes are 10013 and 10002.

the [Y] [X] is one of nine [X] neighborhoods in new york city, as well as one of twelve in the new york metropolitan area, which contains the largest ethnic chinese population outside of asia, enumerating an estimated 779,269 individuals as of 2013; the remaining [X]s are located in the boroughs of queens (up to four, depending upon definition) and brooklyn (three) and in nassau county, all on long island in new york state; as well as in edison and parsippany-troy hills in new jersey.

 in addition, [Y]'s little fuzhou (小福州, 紐約華埠), an enclave populated primarily by more recent chinese immigrants from the fujian province of china, is technically considered a part of [Y]'s [X], albeit now developing a separate identity of its own.

 this neighborhood has been described as the precursor to a new satellite [X] within [Y] itself, which upon acknowledged formation would represent the second chinese neighborhood in [Y], the tenth large chinese settlement in new york city, and the twelfth within the overall new york city metropolitan region.

 the chinese gangs controlled certain territories of [Y]'s [X].

 in the earliest years of the existence of [Y]'s [X], it had been primarily populated by taishanese-speaking chinese immigrants and the borderlines of the enclave was originally canal street to the north, bowery to the east, worth street to the south, and mulberry street to the west.

through the 1970s and 1980s, the influx of guangdong and hong kong immigrants began to develop newer portions of [Y]'s [X] going north of canal street and then later the east of the bowery.

 however, due to the traditional dominance of cantonese-speaking residents, which were largely working class in [Y]'s [X] and the neighborhood's poor housing conditions, they were unable to relate to [Y]'s [X] and mainly settled in flushing, creating a more middle class mandarin town (國語埠) and an even smaller one in elmhurst.

 as a result, [Y]'s [X] and brooklyn's emerging [X] were able to continue retaining its traditional, almost-exclusive cantonese society.

 however, there was already a small and slow-growing fuzhou immigrant population in [Y]'s [X] since the 1970s-80s in the eastern section of [X] east of the bowery.

from the late 1980s through the 1990s, when a large influx of immigrants from fuzhou, who largely also spoke mandarin along with their native fuzhou dialect began moving into new york city, they were the only exceptional group of chinese that were non-cantonese to largely settle into [Y]'s [X].

 due to the fact that the [X] area were mostly populated by cantonese speakers, the fuzhou speaking immigrants had a lot of trouble relating to the neighborhood linguistically and culturally and as a result, they settled on the eastern borderline of [Y]'s [X] east of the bowery, which during that time was more of an overlapping population of chinese, puerto ricans, and jewish as well as had significant vacant apartment units and were more affordable than in the more mandarin-speaking enclaves in flushing and elmhurst, and many fuzhou immigrants had no legal status and being forced into the lowest paying jobs.

not only did the fuzhou immigration influx establish a new portion of [Y]'s [X], they contributed significantly in maintaining the chinese population in the neighborhood.

 as a result, landlords were able to generate twice as much income in [Y]'s, flushing's, and brooklyn's [X]s.

 large numbers of fuzhou speakers have been rapidly moving out of [Y]'s [X] with large numbers of them shifting to brooklyn's [X] in sunset park, which has now overwhelmingly taken over as the largest fuzhou community of new york city.

 this shift replaces the cantonese population throughout brooklyn's sunset park [X] significantly more rapidly than in [Y]'s [X].

 gentrification in [Y]'s [X] has slowed the growth of fuzhou immigration as well as the growth of chinese immigrants to [Y] in general, which is why new york city's rapidly growing chinese population has now shifted primarily to the boroughs of queens and brooklyn.

although mandarin is spoken as a native language among only ten percent of chinese speakers in [Y]'s [X], it is used as a secondary dialect among the greatest number of them.

as the epicenter of the massive fuzhou influx has shifted to brooklyn in the 2000s, [Y]'s [X]'s cantonese population remains viable and large and successfully continues to retain its stable cantonese community identity, maintaining the communal gathering venue established decades ago in the western portion of [X], to shop, work, and socialize—in contrast to the cantonese population and community identity which are shifting from brooklyn's original sunset park [X] to the satellite [X]s in brooklyn.

although the term little hong kong (小香港) was used a long time ago to describe [Y]'s [X] relating to when an influx of hong kong immigrants was pouring in at that time and even though not all cantonese immigrants come from hong kong, this portion of [X] has heavy cantonese characteristics, especially with the standard cantonese, which is spoken in hong kong and guangzhou, china being widely used, so it is in many ways a little hong kong.

 the long-time established cantonese community, which can be considered little hong kong/guang dong or known as the old [X] of [Y] lies along mott, pell, doyer, bayard, elizabeth, mulberry, canal, and bowery streets, within [Y]'s [X].

 originally, the sunset park [X] was a small satellite of [Y]'s western cantonese [X], but since the 2000s, cantonese speakers in brooklyn have been largely shifting to and concentrating in bensonhurst and sheepshead bay/homecrest while the sunset park [X] has largely grown into being a very large fuzhou speaking enclave.

the fuzhou immigration pattern started out in the 1970s, like the cantonese immigration during the late 1800s to early 1900s that had established [Y]'s [X] on mott street, pell street, and doyers street.

[X] lies in [Y] community district 3, which encompasses [X], the east village, and the lower east side.

 [Y]'s [X] has only 27,200 asian residents, compared to the neighborhoods of bensonhurst, brooklyn (46,000); sunset park, brooklyn (31,400); flushing, queens (54,200); and elmhurst, queens (55,800).

a significant difference between the two separate chinese provincial communities in [Y]'s [X] is that the cantonese part of [X] not only serves chinese customers but is also a tourist attraction.

 bowery, chrystie street, catherine street, and chatham square encompass the approximate border zone between the fuzhou and cantonese communities in [Y]'s [X].

unlike most other urban [X]s, [Y]'s [X] is both a residential area as well as commercial area.

 the new york times says that the flushing [X] now rivals [Y]'s [X] in terms of being a cultural center for chinese-speaking new yorkers' politics and trade.

in 2016, the oldest continuously run business in [Y]’s [X] was up for sale: wing on wo and co, established in 1890.

 the district boasts many historical and cultural attractions, and it is a destination for tour companies like [Y] walking tour, big onion, nyc [X] tours, and lower east side history project.

 in august 2011, a new branch of new york supermarket opened on mott street in the central district of grocery and food shopping of [Y]'s [X].

 these two supermarkets are among the largest chinese supermarkets carrying all different food varieties within the long-time established cantonese community in the western section of [Y]'s [X].

[Y]'s [X] has had a history of mini malls with varieties of small shops, however due to the gentrification, this trend has been declining.

 however, two significant well known mini malls in [Y]'s [X] still exist and stand out the most, which are elizabeth center at 13 elizabeth street right next to nypd's 5th precinct and east broadway mall at 88 east broadway under the [Y] bridge.

 elizabeth center has been slightly doing better with prosperity and consumerism than east broadway mall due to the fact that elizabeth center is located in the western portion of [Y]'s [X] where it is the primary commercial center of the chinese community with high volumes of pedestrians along with it being a popular tourist/visitor attraction whereas as east broadway mall is located in the eastern portion of [Y]'s [X] where it attracts very few tourists/visitors and have lower volumes of pedestrians.

for a long time, [Y]'s [X] has always been the most largely concentrated chinese population in new york city, a city where 6% of the overall population is chinese american.

while the composition of these satellite [X]s are as varied as the original, the political factions in the original [Y] [X] (tongs, republic of china loyalists, people's republic of china loyalists, and those apathetic) have led to some factionalization in the satellite [X]s.

 the bensonhurst and sheepshead bay [X]s are primarily cantonese populated as a result of many of them migrating away from both [X]s of [Y] and brooklyn sunset park including new cantonese immigration.

 [Y]'s [X] asian population ranks at 27,200 residents.

 the chinese american experience has been documented at the museum of chinese in america in [Y]'s [X] since 1980.

among the theaters that existed in [X] in later years were the sun sing theater under the [Y] bridge and the pagoda theater, both on the street of east broadway, the governor theater on chatham square, the rosemary theater on canal street across the [Y] bridge, as well as the music palace on the bowery, which was the last chinese theater to close.

the [Y] bridge connects [X] to downtown brooklyn.

flushing now rivals [Y]'s [X] as a center of chinese culture.

 given its rapidly growing status, the flushing [X] has surpassed in size and population the original new york city [X] in the borough of [Y] and this substantial growth has resulted in a commensurate rise in this [X]'s cultural status.

the newly emerging chinese enclaves in sections of bensonhurst, and another one in homecrest/sheepshead bay, are primarily cantonese populated and are more of extensions of the western cantonese section of [Y]'s [X] or little hong kong / little guangdong or cantonese town.

 in addition, the majority of brooklyn's cantonese population is concentrated in bensonhurst, and is slowly replacing [Y]'s [X] as the largest primary cantonese cultural center in new york city resulting in bensonhurst increasingly becoming the main largest attraction for newly arriving cantonese immigrants into new york city with homecrest/sheepshead bay as a smaller secondary attraction.

 in 2011, the new york daily news reported that [Y]'s [X] chinese population dropped from 34,554 to 28,681 from 2000 to 2010, and that it is continuing to decline due to the gentrification going on in lower [Y], which has spurred the increasing growth of newer [X]s in brooklyn including in queens.

 as of the 2010s, the current chinese population in bensonhurst has grown so much that it is enough to create another large [X] surpassing [Y]'s [X] and nearly being as big as sunset park's [X].

 the western portion of [X] is also what was the original size and historic part of [Y]'s [X] or known as the old [X] of [Y] until the eastern part of [X] just east of the bowery became more fully developed due to the influx of fuzhou immigrants during the 1980s-90s primarily on the east broadway and eldridge street portion, which became the new [X].

 the western portion of [X] is also a little hong kong (小香港 siu2 hoeng1 gong2), which was a name that was used at one point to describe [Y]'s [X] when the hong kong immigrants were pouring into the [X] neighborhood and even though not all the cantonese immigrants are from hong kong, this portion of [X] has strong cantonese characteristics, especially with standard cantonese language, which is spoken in hong kong and guangzhou, china being used widely.

 the long time established cantonese community stretches onto pell, doyer, bayard, elizabeth, mulberry, and canal streets and on bowery in [Y]'s [X].

 although the cantonese population is more widespread and mixed in bensonhurst and sheepshead bay/homecrest with other ethnic groups, however it has in recent years surpassed the cantonese population in [Y]'s [X] and with bensonhurst having the highest concentration of cantonese speaking chinese immigrants in brooklyn now, this neighborhood is slowly taking over as nyc's largest primary center of cantonese culture in addition there is a declining chinese population including chinese businesses are declining in [Y]'s [X] due to the gentrification.

however, despite the gentrification going on, [Y]'s [X] is still a very busy chinese business district with many non-asian tourists and visitors attracted to come to [Y]'s [X] to explore chinese culture and food and do shopping as well including many mainland chinese tourists also visit the neighborhood.

 there are also still many chinese consumers from other parts of the tri state that travel to this neighborhood for their shopping and business needs and as a result, chinese businesses in [Y]'s [X] are still making very great profits, which will lead to the likelihood that it will remain as a chinese business district for a long time to come even though the chinese residency population is continuing to decline in the area.

 however, mott street and along with the western cantonese portion of [Y]'s [X] is the main concentration of the busy chinese business district with a large traffic of chinese and non-chinese consumers, which is leading to the high likelihood that the cantonese portion of [Y]'s [X] will be the only or last section to remain as the main significant, if not predominately chinese shopping business district for visitors and tourists in the future.

although chinese food markets can be found in many parts of [Y]'s [X], the portion of mott street between hester and grand streets have the highest concentration of chinese food markets centered together.

 however, since the 2000s, [X] in the neighborhood of sunset park became new york city's new primary destination for the fuzhou immigrants, surpassing the original enclave in [Y].

it was during the 1980s when an influx of illegal immigrants from fuzhou, especially changle, fuqing, and lianjiang flooded east broadway and a little fuzhou enclave evolved on the street, it became fully part of [X], also known as the new [X] of [Y].

 while all of the other mandarin speakers were settling in and creating a more mandarin-speaking [X] or mandarin town (國語埠) in flushing's [X] and elmhurst, queens because they could not relate to the traditional cantonese dominance in [Y]'s [X].

this included the fact that it has had a long history of not being very welcoming of chinese speakers that did not speak cantonese and often easily largely discouraging them from settling into the neighborhood, the fuzhou immigrants were the only exceptional non-cantonese chinese group to largely settle in [Y]'s [X] despite the fact that it was dominantly cantonese speaking and was highly not very welcoming to the fuzhou speakers coming in large numbers.

as a result, they had no choice but to settle into [Y]'s [X] to be around other chinese people to seek affordable housing by chinese property owners and find low skilled job opportunities offered by chinese employers, often as seamstresses in factories and taking positions in waiting tables/dishwashing in restaurants in addition to the fact that it was the only large low income working-class chinese community of new york city in the 1980s–90s that could abundantly offer these opportunities to the new incoming low skilled/lower socioeconomic chinese immigrants as the other [X]s in queens and brooklyn were still relatively much smaller in its early developing stages with much more limited chinese businesses/property owners even though [Y]'s [X] was still largely cantonese dominated until the 1990s and as well being highly discriminatory against any chinese speakers that were not cantonese speakers.

east broadway within [Y]'s [X] became a central hub for these recently arrived fujianese immigrants.

 since the fuzhou immigrants spoke eastern min and not cantonese, as well as their cultural differences and economic background, they were not able to integrate well into [Y]'s [X], which was extremely cantonese-dominated and as a result, they began to settle on east broadway, which was still not fully chinese populated and in addition to higher rates of available housing vacancies, which was another reason why they settled there.

the fuzhou part of [X] is known as the new [X] of [Y] and it is separate from what is known as the old [X] or original [X] of [Y], which is the long-established cantonese [X] going from the bowery to the western of part of [X], although the fuzhou portion of [X] also still has some remaining long time cantonese residents and businesses scattered on different streets that had been residing there before the large influx of fuzhou immigrants.

 in addition, the emergence of little fuzhou has helped [Y]'s [X] maintain the chinese population.

 when [Y]'s [X] was still vastly cantonese-dominated and before the large fuzhou influx, the bowery was the original eastern borderline of [Y]'s [X].

 the fuzhou part of [X] primarily concentrated on the east broadway and eldridge street portion became what is known as the new [X] of [Y] and contributed to [Y]'s [X] growing and developing further east onto the lower east side in contrast to before when this portion was moderately chinese populated.

during the 1980s, housing prices were dropping in [Y]'s [X], but when the fuzhou influx came in during the 1990s, property values increased very fast allowing landlords to make twice as much income.

 with many of them being unable to speak cantonese and because of their illegal statuses, many of them were denied jobs and many resulted in criminal activities to survive a living, which later began to dominate the crimes that were going on in [Y]'s [X].

despite the fuzhou population being large, the cantonese population are still large on the lower east side, especially with the large cantonese community established a long time ago in the western/historic ([X]'s original size) portion of [X] also still being the main chinese commercial business district for all of [Y]'s [X] and with the [X] chinese businesses still mostly cantonese owned along with cantonese residing in more affluent areas also being important customers of [Y]'s [X], the cantonese language still remains important even though mandarin is becoming the lingua franca of [X] allowing cantonese to influence the cultural standards and economic resources of [X].

this influenced many fuzhou people in [Y]'s [X] to learn the cantonese language to maintain jobs and as advantages to bring cantonese customers to additionally contribute to their businesses, especially the large businesses like the dim sum restaurants on east broadway.

since the 2000s, the growth of newly arriving fuzhou immigrants to [Y]'s [X] began to slow down and eventually the fuzhou population in [Y]'s [X] has now started to decline, as the epicenter of fuzhou immigration has relocated to brooklyn due to increasing gentrification in [Y]'s [X].

 some chinese landlords, especially many real estate agencies in [Y]'s [X] mainly of cantonese descent, have been accused of prejudice against the fuzhou immigrants, supposedly making fuzhou immigrants feel unwelcome with concerns that they will not be able to pay rent secondary to debt to gangs that may have helped smuggled them in illegally into the united states and out of fear that gangs will come up to the apartments to cause trouble.

since the 2010s, the fuzhou immigrant population and businesses have been declining throughout the whole eastern portion of [Y]'s [X] due to the gentrification.

however, in the eastern portion of [Y]'s [X], whose apartment buildings carry the vast majority of the fuzhou population, more than half of the fuzhou-occupied apartments have been illegally subdivided into multiple rooms with many beds, running them as extremely overcrowded hotels, many of whose residents do not have leases.

 as a result, as new real estate developers and landlords are purchase more apartment buildings in the eastern fuzhou section of [Y]'s [X], the newer landlords legally evict tenants, allowing them to renovate apartment units and charge higher rent prices to higher-income households.

there have also been many city officials cracking down on illegally subdivided units and kicking out occupants throughout [Y]'s [X], but especially in the fuzhou section, and fuzhou tenant occupied apartments have been the main targets of these crackdowns.

 as a result, many fuzhou tenants have had to resort to illegal apartment subdivision and rent their spaces to many other fuzhou tenants to be able to pay the rent, especially since most of the fuzhou tenants in [Y]'s [X] arrived during the 1990s when the rent was increasingly becoming expensive.

as with their cantonese counterparts in [Y]'s [X], especially including the older western cantonese portion of [Y]'s [X], they are more likely to have legal paperwork to be in the country and have been longer time residents with affordable rent-stabilized leases, which many arrived during the 1980s and earlier when the rents were more affordable.

the increasing fuzhou influx to new york city has shifted to the brooklyn [X] (布鲁克林華埠) located in brooklyn's sunset park neighborhood, which was originally cantonese dominated, in the 2000s because not only has [Y]'s [X] has become too expensive to afford housing, it has also become overcrowded, but also given their desire to continue to live in a chinese community.

brooklyn's [X] has become the satellite little fuzhou of new york city, but it has quickly and largely surpassed as well as marginalizing the one within [Y]'s [X] as nyc's primary fuzhou culture center.

east broadway has been very well known to be in the middle of what is known as the "wall street" of [Y]'s [X], based upon the actual wall street located further downtown which has spawned the metonym for the financial industry, due to the significant number of chinese-owned financial institutions concentrated on this street and surrounding streets.

east broadway was once known to be one of the territories of cantonese gangsters of [Y]'s [X].

a man named herbert liu, a former hong kong police officer had immigrated to [Y]'s [X] in the late 1960s.

 parallel to the cantonese tong gangs that had dominated the long-established cantonese community in the western section of [X], the fuzhou gangs were the same for the fuzhou community that was emerging in the 1990s, which made [Y]'s [X] expand past its original traditional borderlines further east onto the lower east side.

 the chinese population in the new york city area is dispersed across at least 9 [X]s, comprising the original [Y] [X], three in queens (the flushing [X], the elmhurst [X], and the newly emerged [X] in corona), three in brooklyn (the sunset park [X], the avenue u [X], and the new bensonhurst [X]), and one each in edison, new jersey and nassau county, long island, not to mention fledgling ethnic chinese enclaves emerging throughout the new york city metropolitan area.

 today, the [Y] [X] () is home to the largest concentration of chinese people in the western hemisphere and is one of the oldest ethnic chinese enclaves outside of asia.

 within [Y]'s expanding [X] lies a "little fuzhou" on east broadway and surrounding streets, occupied predominantly by immigrants from the fujian province of mainland china.

 the energy and population of [Y]'s [X] are fueled by relentless, massive immigration from mainland china, both legal and illegal in origin, propagated in large part by new york's high density, extensive mass transit system, and huge economic marketplace.

the early settlers of [Y]'s [X] were mostly from hong kong and from taishan of the guangdong province of china, which are cantonese-speaking, and also from shanghai.

 little fuzhou, a prime destination status for immigrants from the fujian province of china, is another, fuzhouese, enclave in [X] and the lower east side of [Y].

 chinese immigrants then moved into this area, not only new arrivals from china, but also members of [Y]'s [X], seeking refuges from high rents, who fled to the cheap property costs and rents of sunset park and formed the brooklyn [X], which now extends for 20 blocks along eighth avenue, from 42nd to 62nd streets.

 this relatively new but rapidly growing [X] located in sunset park was originally settled by cantonese immigrants like [Y]'s [X] in the past, but is now being repopulated by fujianese (including fuzhou people) and wenzhounese immigrants.

the gang that would be known throughout [Y] [X] as born to kill was founded by tho hoang "david" thai, who was born in saigon on january 30, 1956.

during the late eighties, as the born to kill gang began to attract publicity and notoriety in [Y]'s [X] due to their criminal audacity, many smaller groups of organized vietnamese criminals began to adopt the gang's name.

the avenue u [X] is now in expansion mode, despite originating initially from less than ten blocks, originally resembling [Y]'s [X] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when that [X] was still in the early stages of its development, and concentrated within a ten-block section of mott, doyers, and pell streets.

the relatively new but rapidly growing [X] located in sunset park was originally settled by cantonese immigrants as had been [Y]'s [X].

 in the past, sunset park had the highest cantonese population in brooklyn and strongly resembled mott street in [Y]'s [X], the heart of the entrenched cantonese community that continues to thrive in the western portion of [Y]'s [X].

 this allowed [Y]'s and brooklyn's [X]s to continue retaining its almost exclusive cantonese-speaking society and nearly were successful at keeping its cantonese dominance.

 however, in the 2000s, due to gentrification and housing shortages, the fuzhou influx shifted to brooklyn's [X] in much greater numbers, supplanting the cantonese at a significantly higher rate than in [Y].

 sunset park's [X], brooklyn's largest, now mostly populated by fuzhou immigrants has been far surpassing the eastern portion of [Y]'s [X] as nyc's primary fuzhou cultural center.

during the 1980s and 1990s, the majority of newly arriving fuzhou immigrants were settling within [Y]'s [X], and the first little fuzhou community emerged in new york city within [Y]'s [X]; by the 2000s, however, the center of the massive fuzhou influx had shifted to brooklyn's [X], which is now home to the fastest growing and largest fuzhou population in new york city as well as causing the ethnic enclave to develop more fully and expand much further.

since the 2000s, gentrification in [Y]'s [X] has pushed back the growth of fuzhou immigrants and growth of chinese immigrants in general, resulting in a growing chinese population primarily centered in queens and brooklyn.

 this has opened opportunities as well as led to the brooklyn [X] becoming the new nexus for new arriving fuzhou immigrants to new york city, to seek landlords of fuzhou descent and to be able rent an apartment at a lower price in better conditions than in [Y]'s [X] with less housing discrimination and barriers imposed on them, in contrast to cantonese landlords that are more likely to discriminate against fuzhou immigrants and not wanting them to be tenants in their properties, however there are fuzhou landlords that can sometimes still discriminate fuzhou tenants by imposing high rent prices.

unlike the little fuzhou within [Y]'s [X], which further developed the newer portion of [Y]'s [X] rather than settling in the center of the cantonese community of [Y]'s [X] and still remains surrounded by areas which continue to house significant populations of cantonese, all of brooklyn's [X] is swiftly consolidating into new york city's new little fuzhou and is beginning to resemble more and more of the new [X] of [Y], which is the newer portion of [Y]'s [X] established by the fuzhou immigrants primarily concentrated on the east broadway and eldridge street portion.

 also in contrast to [Y]'s [X], which still successfully continues to carry a large cantonese population and retain the large cantonese community established decades ago in the western section of [Y]'s [X], where cantonese residents have a communal gathering venue to shop, work, and socialize, brooklyn's [X] is now very quickly losing its cantonese community identity.

connection to [Y]'s [X]

 another explanation is the direct subway ride to [Y]'s [X] on the bmt fourth avenue line of the new york city subway ().

this [X] is considered to be an extension of the original [X] in [Y].

 a large fuzhouese population moved in, and the sunset park's [X] started to resemble parts of little fuzhou in [Y]—particularly east broadway, the main gathering center for fuzhou residents in [Y].

 they are extensions of [Y]'s western cantonese [X] or little hong kong/guangdong or cantonese town, but at the same time similarly resemble the 1970s–80s of [Y]'s [X] when it was still in expansion mode overlapping into other ethnic enclaves.

 however, the cantonese population growth in these areas have surpassed [Y]'s [X]'s cantonese speaking population and with bensonhurst carrying brooklyn's largest cantonese population with several of their enclaves on 18th avenue, bay parkway and 86th street, it is slowly taking over as nyc's largest primary cantonese cultural center meanwhile manahttan's [X] is undergoing gentrification.

the second [X] and the third [X] of brooklyn, along with other emerging clusters of chinese businesses and people in other parts of bensonhurst particularly on 18th avenue and bay parkway around the , could possibly in the future become the new gathering centers and central business districts for the cantonese residents in brooklyn, resembling the western portion of [Y]'s [X] in the same way that the main brooklyn [X] in sunset park is quickly becoming a gathering center and central business district for the fuzhou residents in brooklyn, resembling east broadway in [Y]'s [X].

  since 2004, the  train on the bmt brighton line goes to canal street in the [Y] [X] to brooklyn's avenue u [X] directly.

 the area was formerly served by , and  trains, both of which went to [Y]'s [X], at canal street and grand street stations, respectively.

this [X] is actually a second extension of [Y]'s [X], after the original brooklyn [X] which had developed in sunset park.

 since 2004, the  has been directly connected 24/7 from the grand street station in [Y]'s [X] to the rapidly growing chinese enclave between 18th avenue and 25th avenue, and bensonhurst [X]s have become a third extension of [Y]'s [X].

 in addition, bensonhurst has slowly been surpassing [Y]'s [X] as carrying the largest cantonese cultural center of nyc.

the new york metropolitan area contains the largest ethnic chinese population outside of asia, comprising an estimated 893,697 uniracial individuals as of 2017, including at least 12 [X]s – six (or nine, including the emerging [X]s in corona and whitestone, queens, and east harlem, [Y]) in new york city proper, and one each in nassau county, long island; edison, new jersey; and parsippany-troy hills, new jersey, not to mention fledgling ethnic chinese enclaves emerging throughout the new york city metropolitan area.

the [Y] [X] (simplified chinese: 纽约华埠 ; traditional chinese: 紐約華埠; pinyin: niŭyuē huá bù), home to the largest enclave of chinese people in the western hemisphere, is located in the borough of [Y] in new york city.

 within [Y]'s expanding [X] lies a little fuzhou on east broadway and surrounding streets, occupied predominantly by immigrants from the fujian province of mainland china.

 the energy and population of [Y]'s [X] are fueled by relentless, massive immigration from mainland china, both legal and illegal in origin, propagated in large part by new york's high density, extensive mass transit system, and huge economic marketplace.

the early settlers of [Y]'s [X] were mostly from taishan and hong kong of the guangdong province of china, which are the cantonese speakers and also from shanghai.

 given its rapidly growing status, the flushing [X] may surpass in size and population the original new york city [X] in the borough of [Y] within a few years, and it is debatable whether this has already happened.

 chinese immigrants then moved into this area, not only new arrivals from china, but also members of [Y]'s [X], seeking refuge from high rents, who fled to the cheap property costs and rents of sunset park and formed what the website of the local branch of the chinese benevolent association has called "the brooklyn [X]", which now extends for 20 blocks along 8th avenue, from 42nd to 62nd streets.

 this relatively new but rapidly growing [X] located in sunset park, brooklyn was originally settled by cantonese immigrants like [Y]'s [X] in the past.

however, in the recent decade, an influx of fuzhou immigrants has been pouring into brooklyn's [X] and supplanting the cantonese at a significantly higher rate than in [Y]'s [X], and brooklyn [X] is now home to mostly fuzhou immigrants.

 in the past, during the 1980s and 1990s, the majority of newly arriving fuzhou immigrants were settling within [Y]'s [X], and the first little fuzhou community emerged in new york city within [Y]'s [X]; by the 2000s, however, the epicenter of the massive fuzhou influx had shifted to brooklyn [X], which is now home to the fastest growing and perhaps largest fuzhou population in new york city.

 unlike the little fuzhou in the [Y] [X], which remains surrounded by areas which continue to house significant populations of cantonese, all of brooklyn's [X] is swiftly consolidating into new york city's new little fuzhou.

also in contrast to [Y]'s [X], which still successfully continues to carry a large cantonese population and retain the large cantonese community established decades ago in the western section of [Y]'s [X], where cantonese residents have a communal gathering venue to shop, work, and socialize, brooklyn [X] is very quickly losing its cantonese community identity.

the occupy homes movement has its roots in the early 1970s, when declining working-class incomes and a lack of bank financing for low-rent properties left thousands of new york city buildings abandoned and hundreds of former tenants squatted vacant buildings on [Y]'s upper west side, east harlem, chelsea, [X], the lower east side, and the williamsburg section of brooklyn.

east broadway is a two-way east–west street in the [X], two bridges, and lower east side neighborhoods of the new york city borough of [Y].

during the 1960s, an influx of hong kong immigrants were arriving over along with taiwanese immigrants as well into [Y]'s [X].

 subsequently, cantonese people and businesses also began to settle onto this street, as [Y]'s [X] was expanding into other parts of the lower east side, and [Y]'s [X] chinese population was vastly cantonese-dominated at the time.

 during this time period, [Y]'s [X] was being referred as a growing little hong kong.

 although the chinese population have been increasing in this portion of the lower east side since the 1960s, however until the 1980s, the western portion of [Y]'s [X] was the most fully chinese populated and developed and flourishing as a busy chinese business district, while east broadway along with the eastern portion of [X] east of the bowery was developing more slowly as being part of [X].

 the eastern portion of [Y]'s [X] had lower and scattered numbers of chinese residents and higher numbers of non-chinese residents mainly latinos and jewish than [Y]'s [X]'s western portion.

it was during the 1980s and 1990s, when an influx of fuzhou immigrants flooded east broadway and a little fuzhou enclave evolved on the street, that east broadway emerged as a distinctly identifiable neighborhood within [X] itself, also known as the new [X] of [Y].

 most of the other mandarin speakers were settling in and creating a more mandarin-speaking [X] or mandarin town (國語埠) in flushing, and eventually an even newer one in elmhurst, both in queens, because they could not relate to the traditional cantonese dominance in [Y]'s [X].

 the fuzhou immigrants were the exceptional non-cantonese chinese group to settle largely in [Y]'s [X], before themselves expanding eventually, on an even larger scale, to the brooklyn [X] (布鲁克林華埠).

 as many fuzhou immigrants came without immigration paperwork and were forced into low paying jobs, [Y]'s [X] was the only place for them to be around other chinese people and receive affordable housing despite [Y]'s [X]'s traditional cantonese dominance that lasted until the 1990s.

 since the 2000s, the influx of the growing fuzhou population into nyc immediately shifted into brooklyn's [X], which during the 1990s was a small cantonese enclave and transformed by the late 2000s and early 2010s into being nyc's largest fuzhou community very quickly and largely replaced and marginalized [Y]'s [X]'s east broadway as the cultural and business center for the fuzhou people in new york and nationally.

 east broadway has now become a lot quieter with fewer people walking around as a result of these factors in addition to the fact that large numbers of fuzhou speakers are moving out of [Y]'s [X] and the presence of high income professionals often non-asian as well as high end hipster businesses are now increasingly growing in the area.

[Y]'s [X] is actually divided into two different portions.

 the western portion is the older and original part of [Y]'s [X], primarily dominated by cantonese populations and known colloquially as the cantonese [X].

 cantonese were the earlier settlers of [Y]'s [X], originating mostly from hong kong and from taishan in guangdong province, as well as from shanghai.

however, within [Y]'s [X] lies little fuzhou or the fuzhou [X] on east broadway and surrounding streets, occupied predominantly by immigrants from the province of fujian, mainland china.

 this eastern portion of [Y]'s [X] developed much later, primarily after the fuzhou immigrants began moving in.

areas surrounding "little fuzhou" consist of significant numbers of cantonese immigrants from the guangdong of china; however, the main concentration of people speaking the cantonese language is in the older western portion of [Y]'s [X].

 large numbers of fuzhou speakers have been rapidly moving out of manhattan's chinatown with large numbers of them shifting to [Y]'s chinatown in [X], which has now overwhelmingly taken over as the largest fuzhou community of new york city.

the increasing fuzhou influx had shifted into the [Y] chinatown in the [X] section of [Y].

 this shift replaces the cantonese population throughout [Y]'s [X] chinatown significantly more rapidly than in manhattan's chinatown.

as the epicenter of the massive fuzhou influx has shifted to [Y] in the 2000s, manhattan's chinatown's cantonese population remains viable and large and successfully continues to retain its stable cantonese community identity, maintaining the communal gathering venue established decades ago in the western portion of chinatown, to shop, work, and socialize—in contrast to the cantonese population and community identity which are shifting from [Y]'s original [X] chinatown to the satellite chinatowns in [Y].

 originally, the [X] chinatown was a small satellite of manhattan's western cantonese chinatown, but since the 2000s, cantonese speakers in [Y] have been largely shifting to and concentrating in bensonhurst and sheepshead bay/homecrest while the [X] chinatown has largely grown into being a very large fuzhou speaking enclave.

 manhattan's chinatown has only 27,200 asian residents, compared to the neighborhoods of bensonhurst, [Y] (46,000); [X], [Y] (31,400); flushing, queens (54,200); and elmhurst, queens (55,800).

 however, since the 2010s, these trends at and around the east broadway mall have been drastically declining along with the fact that storefront businesses and consumerism at the east broadway mall have been continuously declining due to increasing property values and rents as a result of ongoing gentrification, which have been effectively causing fuzhou speaking residents to be declining in the area along with the fuzhou customers from out of state that used to travel to east broadway for commerce have dramatically shifted to traveling to nyc's newer chinatowns in nyc's outer boroughs in [X] [Y] and flushing queens for these accommodations and the covid-19 pandemic in nyc further accelerated worsening the situation at east broadway mall along with their long time upstairs dim sum restaurant to now be shuttered.

another chinese community is located in [X] in [Y], particularly along 8th avenue from 40th to 65th streets.

 unlike the chinese enclaves in queens, which has a very high diversity of chinese immigrants from various regions of mainland china and taiwan, the [Y] chinatowns are very segregated into cantonese dominated enclaves in bensonhurst and sheepshead bay and the fuzhou dominated enclave in [X], although with some significant limited population of long-time cantonese residents.

 the bensonhurst and sheepshead bay chinatowns are primarily cantonese populated as a result of many of them migrating away from both chinatowns of manhattan and [Y] [X] including new cantonese immigration.

 bensonhurst now has 46,000 asian residents while [X] had 31,400 asian residents, which means bensonhurst now has the highest asian population of [Y] surpassing [X] as the original epicenter of [Y]'s asian population.

 [Y] independent television: intro to [X]

the first [Y] chinatown (), was originally established in the [X] area of the new york city borough of [Y].

[Y]'s chinese population has grown larger than the original chinatown area, forming three larger chinatowns between [X], bensonhurst, and avenue u in sheepshead bay.

the 2020 census data from new york city department of city planning indicated that bensonhurst had [Y]'s largest number of asian residents, with 46,000, with central [X] containing 31,400 asian residents.

 chinese immigrants then moved into this area – not only new arrivals from china, but also residents escaping the higher rents of the manhattan chinatown, fleeing to the lower property costs and rents of [X] and forming the [Y] chinatown.

 in the past, [X] had the highest cantonese population in [Y] and strongly resembled mott street in manhattan's chinatown, the heart of the entrenched cantonese community that continues to thrive in the western portion of manhattan's chinatown.

 [X]'s chinatown, [Y]'s largest, now mostly populated by fuzhou immigrants has been far surpassing the eastern portion of manhattan's chinatown as nyc's primary fuzhou cultural center.

 as a result, [Y]'s [X] chinatown is now increasingly becoming the main attraction for newly arrived fuzhou immigrants into new york city.

 by the late 1990s, the growing cantonese population in [Y] had begun to dramatically shift into bensonhurst and sheepshead bay instead of settling into [X] including many of the cantonese already living in [X] also began migrating into bensonhurst and sheepshead bay starting in the late 1990s and especially in the early 2000s and with the large influx of fuzhou immigrants coming, only a handful of cantonese residents still remain often longer time and older generation residents in the now heavily fuzhou dominated chinatown of [X].

since [Y]'s chinatown emergence on 8th avenue in [X], the chinese population has over the years expanded further into [Y]'s sheepshead bay, homecrest, bensonhurst, dyker heights, bath beach, and gravesend neighborhoods.

 this emerging massive chinese presence in [Y] has poured especially into sheepshead bay, homecrest, and bensonhurst, due to the overcrowding and rising property values in the original [Y] chinatown in [X].

 of city planning, the asian populations in these other southern [Y] neighborhoods all together have overwhelmingly outnumbered the asian population in [X].

 bensonhurst alone already surpassed [X] as having the largest concentration of asian residents of [Y].

as the cantonese dissipate from the main [Y] chinatown in [X], the avenue u chinatown and the bensonhurst chinatown now carry the majority of the established cantonese population and continuing to quickly grow in [Y] along with new and growing chinese immigrant population.

the second chinatown and the third chinatown of [Y], along with other emerging clusters of chinese businesses and people in other parts of bensonhurst particularly on 18th avenue and bay parkway around the , could possibly in the future become the new gathering centers and central business districts for the cantonese residents in [Y], resembling the western portion of manhattan's chinatown in the same way that the main [Y] chinatown in [X] is quickly becoming a gathering center and central business district for the fuzhou residents in [Y], resembling east broadway in manhattan's chinatown.

this chinatown is actually a second extension of manhattan's chinatown, after the original [Y] chinatown which had developed in [X].

 the increasing property values and congestion in [Y]'s first established chinatown on 8th avenue in [X] led to the still increasing chinese population in [Y] pouring into the sheepshead bay and homecrest sections, which in the late 1990s resulted in the establishment of a second chinatown on avenue u between the homecrest and sheepshead bay sections.

according to the daily news, [Y]'s asian population, mainly chinese, has grown tremendously not only in the [X] area, but also in bensonhurst, dyker heights, and borough park.

 of city planning, bensonhurst took over and marginalized [X] as having the largest asian population in [Y].
