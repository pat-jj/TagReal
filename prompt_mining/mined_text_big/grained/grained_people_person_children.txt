after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is bound to an altar , a messenger from god <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> before the sacrifice , saying " now i know you fear god .
" <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> up and a ram and it instead of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.
in the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, religious & , that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so .
first , <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>' s willingness to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> the limit of humanity ' s capability to both love and fear god .
in of the , rabbi that the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is a way for god to test <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>' s claim to , and to silence satan ' s protest about <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> who had not brought up any offering to god after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born , also to show a proof to the world that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is the true god - man who is ready to fulfill any of god ' s , even to sacrifice his own son :
the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is in the new testament epistle to the among many of faith in the old testament : " by faith <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, when he was tested , up <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and he who had received the up his only begotten son , of whom it was said , ' in <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> your seed shall be ,' concluding that god was able to raise him up , even from the dead , from which he also received him in a figurative sense .
<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>' s faith in god is such that he felt god would be able to resurrect the slain <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, in order that his prophecy ( genesis 21 : 12 ) might be .
this interpretation can be by symbolism and context such as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey ( genesis 22 : 4 ), or <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> taking the wood and it on his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>' s shoulder ( genesis 22 : 6 ).
another thing to note is how god <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> being <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>' s one and only son whom he ( genesis 22 : 2 , 12 , 16 ).
as further support that the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> the gospel of , when the two went up there , <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> " where is the lamb for the burnt offering " to which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> " god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son .

this analysis of the story light on the connection between the binding and the story of (), in which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> against god ' s unethical plan to destroy the city , without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked : far be it from you to do such a thing : shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just ?" <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>' s ethical rebellion against god in the destruction of in his disobedience to god , refusing to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.
that it is possible that the story " of a tradition in which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> does sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>".
that in the original e story , <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> may have carried out the sacrifice of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of to add the in which a ram is substituted for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

' s sacrifice of his daughter in stark contrast to the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the book of genesis , in which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was about to perform a divinely ordered sacrifice of his son , when an angel of god directly and stopped the sacrifice .
however , in the , the same word for ' burnt offering ' ( , ) used in reference to and his daughter in 11 : 31 is also used in other to human sacrifice , such as the story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ( genesis 22 ) and of and his son ( 2 3 : 27 ).
in its highly account of god ' s testing of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> concerning <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, it in 23 : 50 - 51 : " and when they were going along <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> said to his father : behold , i see here the fire and wood , and where then is the lamb that is to be the burnt offering before the lord ? and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, saying : the lord made choice of thee my son , to be a perfect burnt offering instead of the lamb .

the control the north government over many of the nation ' s culture is used to perpetuate the cult of personality surrounding <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

following the death of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, north were and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event ; similar were broadcast by state television following the death of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.
one point of view is that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>' s cult of personality was solely out of respect for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage , while north government consider it genuine hero worship .

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and being taken to by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in is an important part in the story of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, as it the focus to and is the beginning of ' s sanctification as a holy area .
tradition <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was ordered by god to take and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to , and later <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> returned to to build the .
in many of these , the ( something like a wind or spirit sent by god ), or the angel ( ) them to the location of the , at which point <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> it and afterwards , leaves the other two there ( other below say the construction of the later and that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> took part in it ).
generally , it is said that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> who he is herself and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to as he leaves them .
believe that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was told to sacrifice his son , <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, though the ' an does not mention the name of the son .
some tell of the devil trying to stop god ' s command from being by visiting , <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.
every time the devil <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is going to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, each person that if god it , they should obey .
eventually , <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> about the order and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is willing to be and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to listen to god .

since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>' s son ( and a prophet in at that ), this replacement to point to either the religious of sacrifice itself , or to the future self - of the prophet and his ( who were to emerge from the progeny of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) in the cause of their faith .

" when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his wife repeated <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>' s statement , <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> knew it was from his father and kept his wife .
of those that say <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> took part in the construction , most describe <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> a third time in , during which they raised the .
some say <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> for a final stone , but <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> did not accept the one he brought back .
