  in 2008, however, a series of studies condu[X]ed by the center for competitive politics (which generally opposes regulation and taxpayer funded political campaigns), found that the programs in maine, arizona, and [Y] had failed to accomplish their stated goals, including ele[X]ing more women, reducing government spending, reducing special interest influence on ele[X]ions, bringing more diverse backgrounds into the legislature, or meeting most other stated obje[X]ives, including increasing competition or voter participation.

 1951 world wrestling championships in [Y], finland - gold (freest[X] light heavyweight)

 however, the development in [Y]'s architecture came after 1748 with the construction of the sveaborg fortress - nowadays a world heritage site - (first planned by augustin ehrensvärd) on a group of islands just off the coast from [Y]; the heart of the fortress was a dockyard, but distinct baroque architecture as well as an english-st[X] landscape park were placed within the otherwise unsymmetrical fortification system, all built in stone and brick, and many of the "windows" in the classical facade compositions were in fact painted on.

 among his varied works, he designed new baroque-st[X] town plans for the towns of pori (1852), mariehamn (Åland) (1859) and uusikaupunki (1856), an english-st[X] romantic landscape park for seinäjoki (1858), neo-gothic churches for lovisa (1865) and uusikaupunki (1864), rundbogenstil-neo-gothic lovisa town hall and the house of nobility in [Y] (1862), neo-renaissance nya teatern, [Y] (1853, burnt down 1863) as well as redbrick factory buildings in littoinen, turku, forssa and tampere and various rustic villas for private clients.

 one of his most famous works, the redbrick erottaja fire station, [Y] (1891) is seen as a mixture of neo-gothic and neo-renaissance st[X]s modelled on giotto's campanile in florence and the tower of the medieval palazzo vecchio also in florence.

 his buildings are typical of the eclecticism of the time, designing in both gothic revival st[X] and a so-called neo-renaissance st[X] of classicism, with heavy ornamentation as well as heavy use of colour in interiors but also occasionally in facades, as for instance with his house of the estates, [Y] (1891).

 after graduating at the polytechnical institute, usko nyström (no relation) had continued his studies at the École des beaux-arts in paris in 1890–91; on returning to finland he initially designed (from 1895 to 1908 in the partnership usko nyström-petrelius-penttilä) neo-renaissance architecture - in particular gaining from the growth area of building speculation in middle-class apartment buildings in [Y] - whilst also developing a more jugendstil st[X] inspired by national romanticism, and politically by the pro-independence fennoman movement.

 the more prominent buildings of this national romantic st[X] were built in stone, but the discovery in finland of deposits of soapstone, an easily carved metamorphic rock, overcame the difficulty of using only hard granite; an example of this is the facade of the pohjola insurance building, [Y] (1901) by gesellius, lindgren, and saarinen.

 the jugendstil st[X] was used by gesellius, lindgren, and saarinen in key state buildings such as the national museum and [Y] railway station.

 other key buildings built in this st[X] were the finnish language adult education centre in [Y] (1927) by taucher (with key assistance from p.

 blomstedt), vyborg art museum and drawing school (1930) by uno ullberg, "taidehalli" art gallery, [Y] (1928) and töölö church, [Y] (1930) by hilding ekelund, and several buildings by alvar aalto, in particular the workers' club, jyväskylä (1925), the south-west finland agricultural building, turku (1928), muuramäki church (1929) and the early version of the vyborg library (1927–1935) before aalto greatly modified his design in line with the emerging functionalist st[X].

but beyond these public buildings designed in the nordic classicism st[X], this same st[X] was also used in timber constructed workers' housing, most famously in the puu-käpylä ("wooden käpylä") district of [Y] (1920–1925) by martti välikangas.
