another christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> through <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s brother nathan as it is recorded in the gospel of luke chapter 3 (entirely undocumented in the hebrew bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of mary's father.

 a widely spread traditional christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic line from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to the godlessness of the line of jehoiachin which started in the early 500s bc, when jeremiah cursed the main branch of the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ic line, by saying that no descendant of "[je]coniah" would ever reign on the throne of israel again (jeremiah 22:30).

 rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

” more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

rendsburg argued that the empire of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> provided the setting for the statement in  that god gave to abraham and his descendants “this land, from the river of egypt to the great river, the euphrates.

” rendsburg reasoned that this passage makes sense only in the period of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, as before <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, it would have been unimaginable for an author to use these boundaries to define the land of israel, and after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, israel once more became a small state and those boundaries were an impossibility.

 rendsburg cited this as further support for his conclusion that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 rendsburg argued that the only time that an author would considered this necessary would be in the time of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, as before then, there were no kings (except for the transitional saul), and after then, kingship was a fait accompli.

 arguing that the only time that an author would need to justify kingship was when it was the new creation of israelite political theorists, rendsburg cited these verses as further evidence that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 the sifre cited as examples of admonition near death: (1) when abraham reproved abimelech in , (2) when isaac reproved abimelech, ahuzzath, and phicol in , (3) when joshua admonished the israelites in , (4) when samuel admonished the israelites in , and (5) when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> admonished <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in .

 rendsburg explained genesis's interest with this motif by recalling that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was the youngest of jesse’s seven sons (see ), and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was among the youngest, if not the youngest, of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s sons (see ).

 the two remaining candidates were adonijah (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s fourth son) and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and although adonijah was older (and once claimed the throne when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was old and feeble in ), <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> won out.

 an israelite could thus not criticize <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s selection of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — isaac, jacob, judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

 more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

rendsburg read in  — which portrays the nations of moab and ammon, transjordanian states ruled by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, as descendants of the sons of lot (and thus the grandnephews of abraham) — to indicate that the author of genesis sought to portray the ancestors of these countries as related to the patriarchs in order to justify israelite rule over them.

 rendsburg noted further that  refers to “the land of moriah,” and this word occurs in the bible in only one other place,  “<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> began to build the temple of yhvh in jerusalem on mount moriah, which appeared to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> his father, and which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had prepared as the place, at the threshing floor of ornan (a variant of araunah) the jebusite.

 this has led to the classical rabbinical supposition that the moriah region mentioned in genesis as the place where <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> almost sacrificed <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was in jerusalem.

 in the biblical narrative, god tells <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to sacrifice his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, on moriah.

in the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, religious murders & kabbalah, lippman bodoff argues that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> never intended to actually sacrifice his son, and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so.

 first, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s willingness to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> demonstrates the limit of humanity's capability to both love and fear god.

in legends of the jews, rabbi louis ginzberg argues that the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is a way for god to test <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s claim to ishmael, and to silence satan's protest about <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> who had not brought up any offering to god after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born, also to show a proof to the world that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of god's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:

the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is mentioned in the new testament epistle to the hebrews among many acts of faith recorded in the old testament: "by faith <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, when he was tested, offered up <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, 'in <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> your seed shall be called,' concluding that god was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s faith in god is such that he felt god would be able to resurrect the slain <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, in order that his prophecy (genesis 21:12) might be fulfilled.

 this interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey (genesis 22:4), or <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> taking the wood and putting it on his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s shoulder (genesis 22:6).

 another thing to note is how god reemphasizes <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> being <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s one and only son whom he loves (genesis 22:2,12,16).

  as further support that the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> foretells the gospel of jesus christ, when the two went up there, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> asked <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> "where is the lamb for the burnt offering" to which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> responded "god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.

 the next two verses state god also granted <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> the righteous son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and promised more rewards.

 one side of the argument believed it was <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> rather than ishmael (notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari) interpreting the verse "god's perfecting his mercy on <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>" as referring to his making <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> his closest one, and to his rescuing <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 11–12), in which the angel of yhwh stops <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> before he kills <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 this analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the binding and the story of sodom (), in which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> protests against god's unethical plan to destroy the city, without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked: far be it from you to do such a thing: shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?" <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s ethical rebellion against god in the destruction of sodom culminates in his disobedience to god, refusing to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

francesca stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story "contains traces of a tradition in which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> does sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>".

 friedman argued that in the original e story, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> may have carried out the sacrifice of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of je to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

some scholars also point at the genealogical snippet (verses 20–24) as containing a hint to the question whether <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> sacrificed <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> or not.

jephthah's sacrifice of his daughter stands in stark contrast to the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the book of genesis, in which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was about to perform a divinely ordered sacrifice of his son, when an angel of god directly intervened and stopped the sacrifice.

however, in the hebrew bible, the same word for 'burnt offering' (hebrew, ʿōlāh) used in reference to jepthah and his daughter in judges 11:31 is also used in other biblical stories alluding to human sacrifice, such as the story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (genesis 22) and mesha of moab and his son (2 kings 3:27).

in its highly interpolated account of god's testing of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> concerning <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, it says in 23:50-51: "and when they were going along <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> said to his father: behold, i see here the fire and wood, and where then is the lamb that is to be the burnt offering before the lord? and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> answered his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, saying: the lord has made choice of thee my son, to be a perfect burnt offering instead of the lamb.

 muslims believe that gabriel was the angel who informed zachariah (zakariyyā) of john's birth, as well as mary (maryam) of the future nativity of jesus; and that gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (ʾibrāhīm) of the birth of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (ʾisḥāq) [].

 several sources, such as yalkut shimoni (i, 110) describe him as the guardian angel of esau relating him to rome, the one who wrestled with jacob, the angel who ordered <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and a patron of edom.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and jacob are referred to as the three patriarchs of the people of israel, and the period during which they lived is termed the patriarchal age.

his works inspired the polish branch of hasidism, as well as a more recent wave of torah scholars originating from lithuania and latvia, most markedly rabbi eliyahu eliezer dessler (1892–1953) as well as rabbi <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kook (1864–1935).

 mary surpassed <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> with her faith, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> with her patience and joseph with her chastity.

 before converting, he was a member of the society for the culture and science of the jews, alongside joel <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> list, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> marcus jost and leopold zunz.

bar-chayim further quotes <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kook (1865–1935), founder of the yeshiva and the first ashkenazi chief rabbi of british mandatory palestine:

 its beliefs were based heavily on the teachings of rabbi <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kook and his son, zvi yehuda kook, who taught that secular zionists, through their conquests of eretz israel, had unwittingly brought about the beginning of the messianic age, which would culminate in the coming of the messiah, which gush emunim supporters believe can be hastened through jewish settlement on land they believe god has allotted to the jewish people as set forth in the hebrew bible.

 jesus subsequently defends his belief in resurrection against sadducaic resistance, stating, "and as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of moses, in the story about the bush, how god said to him "i am the god of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the god of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and the god of jacob?" he is god not of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong.

 that the only surviving member of the group of three, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, was being sent back with the elephant was heralded as advance news to charlemagne from two emissaries he met in 801: one was sent by the caliph harun al-rashid himself, another by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (ibrahim ibn al-aghlab), who was governor of africa.

 elaborating on this theme are numerous early and late jewish scholars, including the ramban, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> abrabanel, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> ibn ezra, rabbeinu bachya, the vilna gaon, the lubavitcher rebbe, the ramchal, aryeh kaplan, and rebbetzin esther jungreis.

  most jewish and christian authors view the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (genesis 22), in which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was called by god to offer his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as a burnt offering, as a test of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s loyalty.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kook (1864–1935), rabbi, thinker, diplomat, mediator, scholar

rabbi <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kook wrote an alternative anthem titled "haemunah" ("the faith") which he proposed as a replacement for "hatikvah".

christian identity (also known as identity christianity) is an interpretation of christianity which advocates the belief that only celtic and germanic peoples, such as the anglo-saxon, nordic nations, and/or aryan people and people of kindred blood are the descendants of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and jacob and are therefore the descendants of the ancient israelites.

christian identity adherents assert that the white people of europe in particular or caucasians in general are god's servant people, according to the promises that were given to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and jacob.

 while different <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic faiths portray her differently, judaism, christianity, and islam all depict her character similarly, as that of a pious woman, renowned for her hospitality and beauty, the wife and half-sister of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and the mother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

  by her union with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, she had one child, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

" <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> held a great feast on the day when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was to be weaned.

sometime after the birth of ishmael but before the birth of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, sarah and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> travel to gerar, as described in genesis 20, where events took place which mirrored those of mizraim, in which a king, this time abimelech, took an interest in sarah for her beauty and, as he had done in mizraim, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so, believing her unmarried abimelech took her into her house as pharaoh had though, this time, yahweh intervened before he touched sarah, through dreams and plague.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> thereupon invited all the notabilities to a banquet on the day when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was to be weaned.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> returned to their home at beer-sheba, and, not finding sarah there, went to hebron, where they discovered her dead.

the islamic portrayal of sarah, who is unnamed in the quran, mimics that of her portrayal in judaism and christianity, in that she is a good woman, kin and wife to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who, after years of barrenness, is blessed with a son, the prophet <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (isḥāq).

 the compound, located in the ancient city of hebron, is the second holiest site for jews (after the temple mount in jerusalem), and is also venerated by christians and muslims, both of whom have traditions which maintain that the site is the burial place of three biblical couples; <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and sarah, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and rebecca, and jacob and leah.

there are three stories in genesis where a patriarch identifies his wife as his sister; scholars debate the relationship among these, with some saying that the account of the encounter of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and sarah with pharaoh in genesis 12-13 is the oldest, while the stories of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and sarah encounter king abimelech in genesis 20, and of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and rebecca's encounter with a different king abimelech in genesis 26, are interpretations of that one, generated to explain it or deal with other matters of concern.

according to emanuel feldman (1965), basing his argument on albright's interpretation of the archaeology of nuzu, a wife could legally be awarded the title "sister", and that this was the most sacred form of marriage, and hence <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> referred to their wives as "sisters" for this reason.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s second son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is called father of the hebrews.

 in the hadith, muhammad says that some twenty five thousand prophets and messengers came from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s seed, most of these being from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and that the last one in this line was jesus.

the qur'an speaks extensively about the children of israel (banû isrâ'îl) and recognizes that the jews (al-yahûd) are, according to lineage, descendants of prophet <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> through his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and grandson jacob.

 the patriarchs: the story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and jacob (1959)

 he took certain statements, for example, by the ashkenazi chief rabbi of palestine, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kook regarding the eventual return in time of the temple mount back to jewish hands, and turned them to a concrete political plot to seize control of the area.

the three patriarchs: <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and jacob

 first come the biographies of the men who antedated the several written laws of the torah, as enos, enoch, noah, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and jacob.

 as in judaism and christianity, islam maintains that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the son of the patriarch and prophet <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> from his wife sarah.

 muslims hold <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in deep veneration because they believe that both <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his older half-brother ishmael continued their father's spiritual legacy through their subsequent preaching of the message of god after the death of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the age of 10 when his half-brother ishmael went out from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s house into the desert.

 the quran states that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> received "good tidings of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, a prophet, of the righteous", and that god blessed them both (37: 112).

 and among their progeny are the virtuous and those who clearly wrong themselves"  in a fuller description, when angels came to ibrahim to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on sodom and gomorrah, his wife, sarah, "laughed, and we gave her good tidings of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> of (a grandson) jacob" (11: 71-74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and sarah's old age.

 several verses speak of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as a "gift" to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (6: 84; 19: 49-50), and 29: 26-27 adds that god made "prophethood and the book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson joseph.

 in the quran, it later narrates that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> also praised god for giving him ishmael and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in his old age (xiv: 39-41).

elsewhere in the quran, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); yaʿqūb's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, ishmael and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, ishmael, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; iii: 84).

 alongside <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s tomb are those of some of the other qur'anic/biblical patriarchs and their wives: <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and sarah and jacob and leah.

 in genesis 22, the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> foretells the gospel of jesus christ, when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> asked his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> "where is the lamb for the burnt offering" to which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> responded "god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.

 avot ("ancestors") - praises of god as the god of the biblical patriarchs, "god of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, god of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and god of jacob.

reform judaism has changed the first benediction, traditionally invoking the phrase "god of our fathers, god of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, god of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and god of jacob," one of the biblical names of god.

 new editions of the reform siddur explicitly say avoteinu v'imoteinu "our fathers and our mothers", and reform and some conservative congregations amend the second invocation to "god of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, god of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and god of jacob; god of sarah, god of rebekah, god of leah, and god of rachel.

 its column in the square in front of the building with statue of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was built in 1722.

at the time of the covenant, god informed <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that his wife sarah would give birth to a son, whom he was instructed to name <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 god told <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that he would establish his covenant through <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> inquired as to ishmael's role, god answered that ishmael has been blessed and that he "will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and i will make him a great nation.

a year later, ishmael's half-brother <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> by his first wife sarah when she was 90 years old (), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ().

on the day of feasting during which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> celebrated the weaning of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, ishmael was "mocking" or "playing with" <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (the hebrew word ,  is ambiguous) and sarah asked <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to expel ishmael and his mother, saying: "get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> agreed only after god told him that "in <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> your seed shall be called", and that god would "make a nation of the son of the bondwoman" ishmael, since he was a descendant of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (), god having previously told <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> "i will establish my covenant with [<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>]", while also making promises concerning the ishmaelite nation ().

 the lord's covenant made clear ishmael was not to inherit <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s house and that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> would be the seed of the covenant: "take your son, your only son, whom you love and go to the region of moriah.

ishmael appeared with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> at the burial of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 according to the book of genesis, in the hebrew bible, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> rather than ishmael was the true heir of the <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic tradition and covenant, while at the same time being blessed by god with a great nation.

 in other chapters of the quran, however, which date from the medina period, ishmael is mentioned closely with his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>: ishmael stands alongside <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in their attempt to set up the kaaba in mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> thanks god for granting him ishmael and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in his old age.

 ishmael is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations and jacob's sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, ishmael and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>", when testifying their faith.

 in the quranic narrative of the near-sacrifice of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son, the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was ishmael, tabari maintained that it was <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, consistent with the hebrew scriptures.

the scriptures of the baháʼí faith state that it was ishmael, and not <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who was the son <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> almost sacrificed.

 from this vantage point atop a ridge overlooking jerusalem's old city and the dead sea, tradition holds that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was shown mount moriah as the site for the binding of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as recorded in the bible.

 as to religious zionism, the satmar rebbe described its chief theologian, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kook, as "wicked adversary and enemy of our holy faith".

 in the story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in the book of genesis, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is told by god to kill his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 just as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is about to kill <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, an angel stops <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> from doing so.

 in genesis, god makes a personal covenant with the forefathers <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and jacob.

kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> when "god tested [him] and said to him, take <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, your only son, whom you love, and go to the land of moriah and offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain that i shall show you.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> becomes kierkegaard and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> becomes regine in this interpretation.

) the ethical expression of what <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> did is that he meant to murder <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the religious expression is that he meant to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> – but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet, without this anxiety <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is not who he is.

 problema 3: was it ethically defensible for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to conceal his undertaking from sarah, from eliezer, and from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>?

he says of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, "if the task had been different, if the lord had commanded <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to bring <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> up to mount moriah so that he could have his lightning strike <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and take him as a sacrifice in that way, then <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> plainly would have been justified in speaking as enigmatically as he did, for then he himself could not have known what was going to happen.

 but given the task as assigned to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, he himself has to act; consequently, he has to know in the crucial moment what he himself will do, and consequently, he has to know that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is going to be sacrificed.

 it begins with a paraphrase repeated four times, on the story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s journey to mount moriah to offer <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

beersheba is mainly dealt with in the hebrew bible in connection with the patriarchs <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who both dig a well and close peace treaties with king abimelech of gerar at the site.

 even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to deism instead of revealed religion: "the god of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and jacob—not the god of the philosophers!"

in fear and trembling, kierkegaard focused on <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s willingness to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 god heeded <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and she conceived and bore a son and called him <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, invoking god to add another son.

jacob had twelve sons through four women, his wives, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rachel, and his concubines, bilhah and zilpah, who were, in order of their birth, reuben, simeon, levi, judah, dan, naphtali, gad, asher, issachar, zebulun, joseph, and benjamin, all of whom became the heads of their own family groups, later known as the twelve tribes of israel, and he also had one daughter, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 afterwards, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> became fertile again and gave birth to issachar, zebulun, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, jacob's first and only daughter.

judah is the fourth son of the patriarch jacob and his first wife, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>: his full brothers are reuben, simeon and levi (all older), and issachar and zebulun (younger), gad and asher (younger) by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s handmaid, and one full sister <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> gives birth to two more sons after this, issachar and zebulun, and to jacob's only daughter, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 earlier passages in the book of genesis give some background on her father's family, noting that through him, she is the niece of rebecca, who is the wife of isaac and the mother of jacob and esau, and the granddaughter of bethuel, and rabbinic literature goes even further, with the book of jasher claiming <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rachel were twins and recording her mother's name as a<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and her brothers' names as beor, alub, and murash.

 rabbinical literature contradicts itself on whether or not <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rachel were half-siblings to zilpah and bilhah, two sisters who would serve as mistresses to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s future husband, jacob, and whose children she and rachel would raise as their own, as one source lists them as being daughters of laban, but not his wife a<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and another lists them as being the daughters of rotheus, a man who was close to laban but not related to him.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s (and rachel's) parents were laban and a<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> .

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is the mother of six of jacob's sons, including his first four (reuben, simeon, levi, and judah), and later two more (issachar and zebulun), and a daughter (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>).

 biblical scholars have instead simply proposed that the discrepancy in the enumeration of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s children is due to the list not originally having included <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who was added by a later editor to introduce consistency with the story of the rape of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

in the book of genesis, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (; ) was the seventh child and daughter of jacob and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (jacob's eleventh child and only daughter), and one of the patriarchs of the israelites.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is first mentioned in genesis 30:21 as the daughter of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and jacob, born to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> after she bore six sons to jacob.

so the men of shechem were deceived, and were circumcised; and "on the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of jacob and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, simeon and levi, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s brothers, took their swords and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is specifically listed, in verse 15 ("these are the sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, that she bore to jacob in padan aram, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> his daughter.

one midrash states that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was conceived as a male in <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s womb but miraculously changed to a female, lest the maid-servants (bilhah and zilpah) be associated with more of the israelite tribes than rachel.

 laban's wife and the mother of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rachel was a<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 reuben, appearing without a birth narrative, is then described as bringing mandrakes to his mother <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who then gives birth to issachar, zebulun, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, daughter of jacob and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who when violated by shechem, her brothers slayed the people of shechem in an act of revenge

 and afterwards <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> bore a daughter, and called her name <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 and rav taught that the word "afterward" in  signified that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> bore <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> "after" she passed judgment on herself, reasoning that twelve tribes were destined to issue from jacob and six had already issued from her and four from the handmaids, and if the child of the current pregnancy were to be a boy, then rachel would not have as many sons as one of the handmaids.

rabbi zadok noted that  attributed sons to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> but attributed the daughter <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to jacob, and deduced that the verse thus supported the proposition that if the woman emits her egg first she will bear a son and if the man emits his semen first she will bear a girl.

 it is a first-person narrative that tells the story of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, daughter of jacob and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, sister of joseph.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> opens the story by recounting for readers the union of her mother <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and father jacob, as well as the expansion of the family to include <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s sister rachel, and the handmaids zilpah and bilhah.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> lenney, gross's daughter by his first wife <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, wrote a memoir about her father's murder, bigger than life: a murder, a memoir, published in 2007 by university of nebraska press ().

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> – daughter of jacob, one of the patriarchs of the israelites and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, his first wife.

the three steles (or tablets) of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> are in essence, three hymns written in adoration for the more abstract being, barbelo, from the perspective of the archetype of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (“emmakha <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>”) and his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (or “ger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as”).

 the steles themselves were allegedly written by emmakha <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, a spiritual archetype of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve and founder of the gnostic race (immovable race, seed of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), and thus are considered pseudepigraphic.

 the famous historian of first century, josephus mentions in his antiquities, a story where <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, leaves some stone tablets inscribed with esoteric information for his future offspring high in the mountains.

stele one assumes the voice of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and then of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> together with ger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as praising their respective creators.

hymn 1: <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s hymn to piger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as (the divine <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) and autogenes (the self-generated)

emmakha <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>’s praise of the ger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as is, as the title indicates a hymn dedicating to the glorifying of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>’s father, ger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as, better known as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as, or <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the hymn is from the perspective of emmakha <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, his spiritual archetype, and when he refers to ger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as he is likewise referring to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s spiritual archetype which resides in the lowest realm within barbelo.

 he praises ger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>s for creating him (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and praises “god” for creating ger<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>as.

 the actual lineage the author is likely referring to is that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, was derived from barbelo, who resides over <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and the rest of the lower realms, while barbelo itself was derived from the invisible parent.

 in may 1976, presenter lesley judd interviewed <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, after he had agreed to bring his daughter's diaries to britain.

 faurisson's writing on the subject first came into the spotlight during a court case between <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and heinz roth, a publishing-house owner responsible for the circulation of various neo-nazi writings, including several publications impugning the authenticity of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s diary; faurisson's writing on the subject was entered into the court record as an expert opinion in defense of roth.

hermine "miep" gies (; née santrouschitz; 15 february 1909  – 11 january 2010) was one of the dutch citizens who hid <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, her family (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, margot frank, edith frank-holländer) and four other dutch jews (fritz pfeffer, hermann van pels, auguste van pels, peter van pels) from the nazis in an annex above <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s business premises during world war ii.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm.

 commenting on <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s writing style, the dramatist meyer levin commended frank for "sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel", and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against ernst römer, who distributed a pamphlet titled "the diary of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, bestseller, a lie".

 blair also uses interviews with hanneli goslar and jaqueline van maarsen, two of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s friends, and notably uses archive interviews of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to retell anne's story.

 there are only three instances where a ballpoint pen was used in the diary: on two scraps of paper that were added into the diary at a later date (the contents of which have never been considered <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>’s writing and are usually attributed to being <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s notes) and in the page numbers (also probably added by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> while organizing the writings and papers).

in 2015, the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> fonds made an announcement, as reported in the new york times, that the 1947 edition of the diary was co-authored by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 frank recalled silberbauer confiscating their valuables and money, taking these spoils away in <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s briefcase, which he had emptied onto the floor, scattering out the papers and notebooks which made up the diary of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

soon after, kugler and johannes kleiman, together with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, edith frank-holländer, margot frank, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, hermann van pels, auguste van pels, peter van pels, and fritz pfeffer, were arrested and taken to gestapo headquarters in amsterdam.

margot betti frank (16 february 1926 – february or march 1945) was the elder daughter of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and edith frank and the elder sister of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

margot betti frank, named after her maternal aunt bettina holländer (1898–1914), was born in frankfurt, germany, to jewish parents, otto and edith, and lived in the outer suburbs of the city with her parents, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and edith frank-holländer, and also her younger sister  <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, during the early years of her life.

embittered by the unrepresentative portrait, charlotte pfeffer severed her links with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and miep gies as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s fame grew in the decades after the war, and refused interview requests.

in the book of exodus, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (; ) is the husband of jochebed and father of aaron, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and miriam.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in arabic is spelled  (‘imrān ), was the husband of jochebed and father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and aaron.

 as mentioned by his given name, mûsâ bin 'imrān, which means <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the exodus rabbah argues that when the pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the nile, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> divorced jochebed, who was three months pregnant with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed; however, the text goes on to state that miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry jochebed again.

 at this time <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born to his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, son (or descendant) of kehath the levite, who entered egypt with jacob's household; his mother was jochebed (also yocheved), who was kin to kehath.

 there was also on the top of the throne a golden candelabrum, on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs adam, noah, shem, abraham, isaac, jacob, and job, and on the seven of the other the names of levi, kohath, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, aaron, eldad, medad, and, in addition, hur (another version has haggai).

 a similar genealogy is given in the book of exodus, where it is added that among kohath's sons was one—<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>—who married a woman named jochebed, who was closely related to his father, and they were the biological parents of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, aaron, and miriam; though some greek and latin manuscripts of the torah state that jochebed was <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s father's cousin, the masoretic text states that she was his father's sister, and the septuagint mentions that she was one of his father's sisters.

also in the dead sea scrolls is a recounting of a dream of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him.

miriam ( mīrəyām) is described in the hebrew bible as the daughter of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and jochebed, and the older sister of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and aaron.

miriam was the daughter of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and jochebed; she was the sister of aaron and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the leader of the israelites in ancient egypt.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> married his paternal aunt jochebed, the mother of miriam, aaron and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in those works, spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential god—the god of abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>; and claims that the law was neither literally given by god nor any longer binding on jews.

 god of abraham, god of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, god of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, not of the philosophers and the scholars.

 clines, in his influential the themes of the pentateuch (1978), identified the overarching theme of the five books as the partial fulfilment of a promise made by god to the patriarchs, abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

in jewish legend, david's sin with bathsheba is the punishment for david's excessive self-consciousness who had besought god to lead him into temptation so that he might give proof of his constancy as abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (who successfully passed the test) whose names later were united with god's, while david eventually failed through the temptation of a woman.

 in mishkan t'filah, the american reform jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to god as “he” have been removed, and whenever jewish patriarchs are named (abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), so also are the matriarchs (sarah, rebecca, rachel, and leah.

 at god's command, noah's descendant abraham journeys from his birthplace (described as ur of the chaldeans and whose identification with sumerian ur is tentative in modern scholarship) into the god-given land of canaan, where he dwells as a sojourner, as does his son <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and his grandson <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the following year <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> yaple, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> dumond, and peter hinepaw returned with their families and constructed log cabins.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> favored esau, and rebekah favored <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 while esau was hunting, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> became <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s primary heir and esau was left in an inferior position.

according to local tradition, the graves of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rebekah, along with the graves of abraham and sarah and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and leah, are in the cave of the patriarchs.

in the epistle to the hebrews, abraham's willingness to follow god's command to sacrifice <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is used as an example of faith as is <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s action in blessing <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and esau with reference to the future promised by god to abraham.

 among <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s children was the follow-up israelite patriarch <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who is also venerated as an islamic prophet.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is mentioned seventeen times by name in the quran, often with his father and his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in a fuller description, when angels came to abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on sodom and gomorrah, his wife, sarah, "laughed, and we gave her good tidings of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> of (a grandson) <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>" (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite abraham and sarah's old age.

 several verses speak of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> as a "gift" to abraham (6: 84; 14: 49–50), and 24: 26–27 adds that god made "prophethood and the book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and his prophetic great-grandson joseph.

elsewhere in the quran, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "abraham, ishmael and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "abraham, ishmael, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84).

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> are mentioned as being bestowed upon abraham as gifts of god, who then worshipped god only and were righteous leaders in the way of god:

according to martin noth, a scholar of the hebrew bible, the narratives of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> date back to an older cultural stage than that of the west-jordanian <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 later, the descendants of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> were enslaved in egypt, and god commanded moses to lead the exodus from egypt.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> first appears in the book of genesis, where he is described as the son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rebecca, and the grandson of abraham, sarah and bethuel.

 according to the biblical account, he was the second-born of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s children, the elder being <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s fraternal twin brother, esau.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his twin brother, esau, were born to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was 60 years of age.

 moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: "and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> loved esau, because he did eat of his venison: but rebecca loved <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 it is suggested that she realized prophetically that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s blessings would go to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger.

 rebecca blessed <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and she quickly ordered <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to bring her two kid goats from their flock so that he could take esau's place in serving <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and receiving his blessing.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> did as his mother instructed and, when he returned with the kids, rebecca made the savory meat that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> loved.

disguised as esau, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> entered <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s room.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> demanded that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like esau's hairy skin.

 confused, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> exclaimed, "the voice is <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s voice, but the hands are the hands of esau!" still trying to get at the truth, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> asked him directly, "art thou my very son esau?" and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> answered simply, "i am.

" <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him.

 as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> kissed his father, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> smelled the clothes which belonged to esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was esau.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> then blessed <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> with the blessing that was meant for esau.

 the realization that he had been deceived shocked <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, yet he acknowledged that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> had received the blessings by adding, "indeed, he will be [or remain] blessed!" (27:33).

 having made <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> a ruler over his brothers, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> could only promise, "by your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck" (27:39–40).

although esau sold <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> his own birthright, which was his blessing, for "red pottage," esau still hated <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> for receiving his blessing that their father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> unknowingly had given to him.

 he vowed to kill <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as soon as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died.

 she convinced <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to send <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> away by telling him that she despaired of his marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of canaan (as esau had done).

 after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> sent <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> away to find a wife, esau realized his own canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes and so he took a daughter of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s half-brother, ishmael, as another wife.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> actually diverted himself to succoth and was not recorded as rejoining esau until, at machpelah, the two bury their father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who lived to be 180, and was 60 years older than they were.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was finally reunited with his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in mamre (outside hebron).

when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died at the age of 180, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and esau buried him in the cave of the patriarchs, which abraham had purchased as a family burial plot.

 a conservative interpretation is that, at <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s burial, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> obtained the records of esau, who had been married 80 years prior, and incorporated them into his own family records, and that moses augmented and published them.

 in that case, since <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was 60 when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and essau were born and they had been married for 20 years, then <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was 40 years old when he married rebecca (gen.

 in either case, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rebecca were married for 20 years before <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and esau were born.

rashi explained that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, when blessing <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> instead of esau, smelled the heavenly scent of gan eden (paradise) when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> entered his room and, in contrast, perceived gehenna opening beneath esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by esau's show of piety.

in contrast to the judeo-christian view of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, one main difference is that the story of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s blessing, in which he deceives <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, is not accepted in islam.

 dever wrote in 2001: "after a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, or <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> 'historical figures.

 according to rabbi jose bar hanina, each of the patriarchs instituted one prayer: abraham the morning, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> the afternoon and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> the evening prayers.

 some claim that it originates from an aramaic word, de'avuhon or d'avinun, meaning 'of their/our forefathers', as the three prayers are said to have been invented by abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the eldest son of joseph abendana and brother to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> abendana.

several years later, with his brother, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> published the bible commentary miklal yofi by solomon ben melekh which included his own commentary, lekket shikchah (gleanings), on the pentateuch, the book of joshua, and part of the book of judges.

the biblical book of genesis speaks of the relationship between fraternal twins <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and esau, sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and rebecca.

 the story focuses on esau's loss of his birthright to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the conflict that ensued between their descendant nations because of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s deception of their aged and blind father, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, in order to receive esau's birthright/blessing from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

this conflict was paralleled by the affection the parents had for their favored child: "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who had a taste for wild game, loved esau, but rebekah loved <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 despite the deception on the part of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his mother to gain <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s patriarchal blessing, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s vocation as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s legitimate heir in the continued founding of the jewish people is reaffirmed.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> brought <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> a dish of goat meat prepared by rebecca to taste like venison.

 she explains to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that she has sent <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to find a wife among her own people.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, having fled for his life, leaves behind the wealth of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s flocks and land and tents in esau's hands.

 the next time <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and esau meet is at the burial of their father, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, in hebron.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> then refuses to take <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s blessing back after learning he was tricked, and does not give this blessing to esau but, after esau begs, gives him an inferior blessing.

 exodus 13) that the god of abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> gave the hebrews their "law" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and sabbaths.

 for example, in the 11th-century writings of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> ben <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ha-cohen, lilith left adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the garden of eden after she had coupled with the archangel samael.

the mystical writing of two brothers <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> hacohen, treatise on the left emanation, which predates the zohar by a few decades, states that samael and lilith are in the shape of an androgynous being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the throne of glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to adam and eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite.

1994 – <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> begins to assume supreme leadership of north korea upon the death of his father, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 possibly to avoid referring to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> or kim jong-un as the enemy, the second syllable of "enemy" is written and pronounced  in the north.

the ruling kim family in north korea (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un) has been described as a de facto absolute monarchy or a "hereditary dictatorship".

in 1992, as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s health began deteriorating, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> slowly began taking over various state tasks.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died of a heart attack in 1994, with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> declaring a three-year period of national mourning before officially announcing his position as the new leader afterwards.

 his grandfather <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the founder and leader of north korea until his death in 1994, is the country's "eternal president", while his father <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> who succeeded <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> as the leader was announced "eternal general secretary" and "eternal chairman of the national defence commission" after his death in 2011.

 the control the north korean government exercises over many aspects of the nation's culture is used to perpetuate the cult of personality surrounding <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 while visiting north korea in 1979, journalist bradley martin wrote that nearly all music, art, and sculpture that he observed glorified "great leader" <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, whose personality cult was then being extended to his son, "dear leader" <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 following the death of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, north koreans were prostrating and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event; similar scenes were broadcast by state television following the death of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 one point of view is that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s cult of personality was solely out of respect for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage, while north korean government sources consider it genuine hero worship.

 portraits and sculptures depicting <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un are classed as "number one works".

 the event is an artistic representation of the country's history and pays homage to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, succeeded him, and was in turn succeeded by his son, kim jong-un.

in october 1980, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was introduced to the public at the sixth party congress as the successor to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the politics in the last years of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> closely resemble those of the beginning of the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> era.

after the death of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in 1994, his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> reigned as the new leader, which marked the closure of one chapter of north korean politics.

 in april 1997, on the 85th anniversary of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s birthday, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> promoted 127 general and admiral grade officers.

after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s death in 1994, some members of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s faction proposed changing the name of pyongyang to "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> city" (), but others suggested that north korea should begin calling seoul "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> city" instead and grant pyongyang the moniker "<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> city".

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> became the supreme leader until his death in 1994, after which his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> took power.

 it is comparable in many ways to that of mao zedong in china and of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in north korea.

 according to lim jae-cheon, kim cannot have been born in vyatskoye as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s war records show that he arrived at vyatskoye only in july 1942 and had been living in voroshilov before, thus <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is generally agreed to have been born in voroshilov.

 another flower, kimilsungia, is an orchid cultivar named after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s father and predecessor, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> organized his resistance against the japanese forces there, and north korea claims that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born there, although records outside of north korea suggest that he was actually born in the soviet union.

 other communist leaders with pronounced cults of personality such as mao zedong, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, ho chi minh, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and most recently hugo chávez have also had their cadavers preserved in the fashion of lenin's preservation and are now displayed in their respective mausoleums.

in north korea, manse was used to wish long life for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and for the political principles of his father, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s death in 2011, he received a similar treatment to his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, being declared "eternal general secretary of the workers' party of korea" and "eternal chairman of the national defense commission".

 currently, embalmed communist leaders can also be found in the mausoleum of mao zedong, the ho chi minh mausoleum, and the kumsusan palace of the sun for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> developed the ideology, which was originally viewed as a variant of marxism–leninism until it was declared a distinct ideology by his son and successor, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 north korean state media had previously described <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s ideas as "contemporary marxism–leninism"; by calling them "kimilsungism", <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> sought to elevate the ideas of his father to the same level of prestige as stalinism and maoism.

 as well as stating that the wpk was "the party of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>", the conference proclaimed kimilsungism–kimjongilism as "the only guiding idea of the party".

 in the 4th conference's aftermath, the korean central news agency (kcna) stated that "the korean people have long called the revolutionary policies ideas of the president [<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>] and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as kimilsungism–kimjongilism and recognized it as the guiding of the nation".

 thanks to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> argued, the revolution had "put forward original lines and policies suited to our people's aspirations and the specific situation of our country".

 mass games are the culminating annual celebrations of the state leader's birthdays and the rituals commemorating the foundation of the state: on the birthdays of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (april 15, 1912), the founding father of north korea, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (born february 16, 1942), the former leader of the state.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> badges

in the early 1980s, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> sought to reduce the song's importance to the benefit of "song of general <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>".

"song of general <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>" and "song of general <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>" have since taken the place of de facto national anthems domestically, and "aegukka" is reserved for representing north korea internationally: when foreign dignitaries visit the country or north korean athletes compete at international sporting competitions.

 instead of depicting the portrait of north korea's founder <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the note depicts an image of his birthplace in mangyondae and on the back the international friendship exhibition in myohyangsan that displays gifts he and his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> received from foreign leaders.

 there has been ongoing speculation that this could indicate plans for higher denominations to be released later which would depict <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, or possibly both.

 many older musical forms remain and are used in both traditional performances that have been attuned to the ideas and the way of life of the modern north korean communist state and to accompany modern songs in praise of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, his son and successor, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and kim jong-un from 2012 onward, plus songs that wish for a reunited korea, thus creating a mix of traditional and western music that is truly north korean, a unique variant of korean music as a whole mixing the old and the new.

 south korean artist kim hee-chul, north korean leaders, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un are from the jeonju clan of the gims.

: <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (1948–1994), succeeded by his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (1994–2011), succeeded by his son kim jong-un (2011–present).

 she also said that the order for the bombing had been "personally penned" by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the son of north korean supreme leader <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who had wanted to destabilize the south korean government, disrupt its upcoming 1988 parliamentary elections, and frighten international teams from attending the 1988 summer olympics in seoul later that year.

 because <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> aimed to keep his affair with song a secret due to the disapproval of his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, he initially kept jong-nam out of school, instead sending him to live with song's older sister song hye-rang, who tutored him at home.

 these reports were supported in april 2009 when kim jong-un assumed a low-level position within the ruling workers' party since <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was groomed by his own father, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, in a similar way before becoming north korean leader in 1994.

 a similar campaign was launched in praise of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s mother (kim jong-suk) during the later years of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s life.

 they were abducted on the orders of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the son of north korean president <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who wanted to use them to improve the north korean film industry.

 in april 1984, south korean government officials stated that the kidnappees were working in north korea producing propaganda films that glorified <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

north korean leaders <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and kim jong-un have each periodically purged their political rivals or perceived threats, beginning in the 1950s.

" in june 1964 on one of his first official activities, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> visited kcna headquarters and said the agency should be "propagating the revolutionary ideology of the leader (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) widely throughout the world.

 promoting the popularity of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and kim jong-un.

emphasizing the names of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and kim jong-un by enlarging their names on the text.

 in contrast, kim jong-un, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> are credited for their "outstanding wisdom", "unique abilities" or "noble virtue".

the 2012 joint editorial edition, the first under kim jong-un's leadership, started with a great tribute to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and aside from recurring calls for improving inter-korean relations and for the fulfillment of the october 4 declaration of 2007, also called on the whole nation to give priority to do <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s 2012 mission of strong and prosperous nation, continue his and his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s legacies to the entire country and the socialist cause, and to build up and encourage the various sectors that compose the nation to become contributors to national progress in all areas at all costs.

 this held true when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died in 1994 and was succeeded by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who in turn was succeeded by kim jong-un in 2011.

the north korean government promotes the cult of personality of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, described as a political religion, as well as the juche ideology, based on korean ultranationalism, which calls on people to "avoid spiritual deference to outside influences", which was interpreted as including religion originating outside of korea.

 at this time the rank of marshal was divided into two ranks: the rank of marshal with the title "marshal of the democratic people's republic of korea" (konghwaguk wonsu) was conferred upon <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and the same rank but with the title "marshal of the korean people's army" was conferred upon o jin-u.

one armoured train that remains in regular use is that of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, which the former received as a gift from the soviet union and the latter used heavily for state visits to china and russia as he had a fear of flying.

prior to an internal propaganda film released after the ascension of kim jong-un, there were three attempts made to idolize ko, in a style similar to that associated with kang pan-sok, mother of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and kim jong-suk, mother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the first wife of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 he was the father of the north korean founder <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the paternal grandfather of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and a great-grandfather of the current leader of north korea, kim jong-un.

kim pyong-il (, ; born 10 august 1954) is the younger paternal half-brother of the former leader of north korea, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and the only surviving son of former leader and president of north korea <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> knew that this could be portrayed as a threat to the cult of personality surrounding their father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and reported the matter; <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was reportedly infuriated, and thus kim pyong-il fell out of favour with his father while <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> strengthened his position.

 they teach a strong pro-north korean ideology and allegiance to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un.

 it includes a peculiar personality cult feature by which pressing  or  produces titles exalting <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, respectively.

 all advertising was removed and replaced by portraits of leaders, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

kim jong-un (leader of north korea, 2011–present), grandson of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>other members of kim familykim jong-nam (first son of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>)

 there is a bar and a bookshop which stocks north korean reading material including treatises of president <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and general <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the 2012 joint editorial edition, the first under kim jong-un's leadership, started with a great tribute to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and aside from recurring calls for improving inter-korean relations and for the fulfillment of the october 4 declaration of 2007, also called on the whole nation to give priority to do <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s 2012 mission of strong and prosperous nation, continue his and his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s legacies to the entire country and the socialist cause, and to build up and encourage the various sectors that compose the nation to become contributors to national progress in all areas at all costs.

 the national media is focused almost entirely on political propaganda and the promotion of the personality cults surrounding <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

in distinction from the internment camps for political prisoners, the re-education camp prisoners are instructed ideologically after work and are forced to memorize speeches of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and to undergo self-criticism rites.

after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died, the post of president remained vacant (officially <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was proclaimed eternal president) as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> planned a new state reorganization.

 however, the premier ranks as the lowest of the three: significantly, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was ndc chairman without interruption from 1993 until 2011, and kim yong-nam was president of the spa presidium from 1998 to 2019, while there have been six premiers since <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s death.

koreans born or settled overseas have been migrating back to both north and south korea ever since the restoration of korean independence; perhaps the most famous example is <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, born in vyatskoye, khabarovsk krai, russia, where his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had been serving in the red army.

kim jong-suk (; 24 december 1917  – 22 september 1949) was a korean anti-japanese guerrilla, a communist activist, north korean leader <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s first wife, former leader <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s mother, and current leader kim jong-un's grandmother.

 after the announcement, the national anthem, "song of general <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>" and "song of general <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>" are played.

 if there are any items about <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> or kim jong-un, these are the top bulletins.

in 1983, however, he was removed from the assembly and his standing deteriorated; though he had been <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s teacher at <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> university, kim now spoke to him only to criticize him, specifically admonishing him for taking too close an interest in china's capitalist reforms.

today, mass games are regularly performed only in north korea, where they take place to celebrate national holidays such as the birthdays of former rulers <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

the preamble describes north korea, which has the official name of the democratic people's republic of korea, as the "socialist state of juche" that applies the ideas and achievements of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> on state construction.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is credited as the "peerless patriot and defender of socialist korea" who had kept <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s policies and turned north korea into a politico-ideological power, a nuclear state and a military power through songun politics.

according to author suki kim's memoir of her time teaching at pyongyang university of science and technology, there are twelve "wonders of songun": the sunrise at mount paektu (the alleged birthplace of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>); the winter pine trees at the dabaksol guard post (where <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> supposedly launched the  policy); the cheollyeong azaleas (a "frontline" hill where <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> visited often); the evening view of jangji mountain near the changja river (a refuge for a young <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> during the korean war); the sound of the ullim waterfall in the mountains above munchon, kangwon province (as it is the sound of a "powerful and prosperous nation"); the horizon at handurebol (the handure plain in taechon county) for this was the location of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s land reform in 1998 after the famine; taehongdan county's large fields of potato flowers (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is said to have fought the japanese here and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> turned it into the country's largest potato farm); the area around the mountain village of beoman-ri in sohung county, north hwanghae province (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> rebuilt the village after the famine and is claimed as the "pride of a communist country"); the bean (or nut) farming program kim jong-un instituted to provide food for the military; the large rice farm in migok, sariwon; the taedonggang fruit farm in pyongyang; and the ryongjung fish farm in south hwanghae province.

kimilsungism-kimjongilism, after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>

 the attack coincided with a meeting of the conference of non-aligned nations in colombo, sri lanka, at which <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the son of north korean leader <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, presented the incident as an example of american aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a u.

 the "guidelines for juche literature", published by the official  (), emphasised that literature must extoll the country's leader, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and, later, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 han sorya's history (mr: ryŏksa) was the first long work to deal with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> during the anti-japanese struggle, whereas the immortal history (mr: pulmyŏl-ŭi ryŏksa) and the immortal leadership (mr: pulmyŏl-ŭi hyangdo) are classics that praise <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> respectively.

 15 were carried out under the rule of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and 16 under <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 it is thought that kim's official birth year was changed for symbolic reasons; 1982 marks 70 years after the birth of his grandfather, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and 40 years after the official birth of his father <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 there have also been reports that citizens in north korea were encouraged to sing a newly composed "song of praise" to kim jong-un, in a similar fashion to that of praise songs relating to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the only higher rank is dae wonsu (roughly translated as grand marshal or generalissimo) which was held by kim's grandfather, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and which was awarded posthumously to his father, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, in february 2012.

 during the presidency of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> helped to run his father's own personality cult.

 although the "song of general <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>" is not as widely popular as the "song of general <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>" (nor was his cult as large as his father's), it is also played regularly in north korea.

in the north, names of leaders  (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>),  (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and  (kim jong-un) are always set off from surrounding text, typically by bolding the characters, increasing the font size, or both.

within four hours of the attack, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the son of the north korean leader, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, addressed the conference of non-aligned nations in colombo, sri lanka, and presented a prepared document describing the incident as an unprovoked attack on north korean guards that had been led by american officers.

during the 1970s, yon further advanced in the party and by the middle 1980s he was regarded as the fourth most powerful person in north korea after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and veteran marshal and defence minister o jin-u.

according to jang jin-sung, kim song-ae had the ambition to place her son, kim pyong-il in the position of successor to her spouse <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, rather than his son from his first marriage, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in this, she was supposedly supported by a faction of the north korean political elite, among them her brother kim kwang-hop, and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s brother kim yong-ju, and opposed by the faction of her stepson <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in parallel, her stepson <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> became the designated heir of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and his faction worked to remove her from influence.

 south korea accused <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, son of then-north korean leader <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, of ordering the 1987 bombing of flight 858.

in 2016, the title "eternal leaders of juche korea" was introduced by amending the preamble of the constitution, which was given to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in the 1970s, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, before he became leader, made sure the mansudae art troupe portrayed his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> as a revolutionary genius who liberated korea from the japanese occupation, portrayed the history of the kim family favourably and eulogising north korean revolutionaries.

 these include the man'gyŏndae prize held since at least 2002 in march through april in honour of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s birthday, the paektusan prize held since at least 2010 in february in honour of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s birthday, and the poch'ŏnbo torch prize held since 2010 in may through june to mark the anniversary of the battle of poch'ŏnbo.

 in the case of north korea, the personality cult of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was associated with inherited leadership, with the succession of kim's son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in 1994 and grandson kim jong-un in 2011.

the kumsusan palace of the sun (), formerly the kumsusan memorial palace (), and sometimes referred to as the <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> mausoleum, is a building near the northeast corner of the city of pyongyang that serves as the mausoleum for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the founder of north korea, and for his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, both posthumously designated as eternal president and eternal general secretary of north korea respectively.

 they are filed through a dust blowing machine and enter the rooms  with the preserved remains of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> lying in state.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> badges

the youth movement shifted its focus after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s death and expanded its ideological indoctrination to include the "revolutionary accomplishments" of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the "brilliance" of songun.

 after his years as a guerilla leader, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had moved to the soviet union (where historians believe his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born in 1941) and had become a captain in the red army.

this kim yong-il should not be confused with another kim yong-il (1955–2000?), the son of the late <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and half-brother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who is said to have died in germany in 2000.

 this allowed <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who was <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s designated successor, to be elected as chairman of the national defence commission on 9 april 1993.

 the media dedicate a large portion of their resources toward political propaganda and promoting the personality cult of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and kim jong-un.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was made commander-in-chief and head of the military affairs commission by his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in the spring of 1994.

 he was married to kim kyong-hui, the only daughter of north korean premier <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and his first wife kim jong-suk, and only sister of north korean general secretary <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 at the time, kim pyong-il, the son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and half-brother of future north korean leader <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, had just arrived in budapest as ambassador; in response to hungary's moves towards ties with the south, the north transferred him to bulgaria.

 seong's younger sister song hye-rim, a popular actress, secretly began an affair with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> against his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s wishes in the late 1960s or early 1970s, which culminated in hye-rim's forced divorce from her husband; hye-rang first learned of the situation on 10 may 1971, when kim came to her residence in the middle of the night and informed her that he had impregnated her younger sister.

yi's mother, seong hye-rang, raised <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s and her younger sister hye-rim's son kim jong-nam alongside yi and yi's sister nam-ok at a secluded villa outside of pyongyang in order to keep jong-nam's parentage a secret from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 during <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s rule, only <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> hung on these buildings, although his portrait on the building below the flag of the dprk was removed.

the ability of chukjibeop (축지법 縮地法) was attributed to north korean leaders <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the propaganda song "the general uses warp".

he was elected chairman of the standing committee of the supreme people's assembly in 1983, after having been a vice-chairman since 1962; in this capacity, he assumed the functions of de facto head of state after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s death in 1994, as the post of president of the republic was never reassigned; however, actual power was held by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 o was considered the third most powerful person in north korea, after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, therefore making him the most powerful person that possessed no blood relations to the kim family.

 thanks to his relationship with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, o jin-u was able to enjoy wealth and fame, this lasted even under <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 o jin-u, as the most powerful figure of the korean people's army who commanded the army with the absolute trust of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, was a formidable opponent to have, so <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> begins to convince o jin-u, who was trusted by his father, rather than eliminate him, and eventually, he turned o jin-u into a supporter of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 becoming extremely close to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, he is credited among the top officials who "proposed" <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to be <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s heir at a central committee plenum in 1974.

 he also was the second-ranking member of the <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> funeral committee in 1994, immediately beneath <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 among those elected were <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in a north korean mass games that xi attended, he was depicted inside a gold-framed circle surrounded by red — the same style previously used to depict kim jong-un's father, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and grandfather, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the current leader is kim jong-un, the late president <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s grandson and son of deceased leader <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 at the 6th congress he lost his politburo and central committee seats, and rumors that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had begun grooming <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in 1966 were confirmed.

 the wpk could not address the crisis facing <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s leadership at home and abroad, in part because of the gerontocracy at the highest level of the wpk and the state.

after celebrations for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s 70th birth anniversary, during which he was elevated to the rank of taewonsu — usually translated as grand marshal or generalissimo — on 18 february the politburo announced the 4th party conference (scheduled for mid-april 2012, near the 100th birth anniversary of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) "to glorify the sacred revolutionary life and feats of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> for all ages and accomplish the juche cause, the songun revolutionary cause, rallied close around kim jong-un".

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s first choice as successor was kim yong-ju, his brother, but he later decided to appoint his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> instead; this decision was formalized at the 6th congress.

" the ruling kim family in north korea (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un) has been described as a de facto absolute monarchy or "hereditary dictatorship".

 he became part of the "1980 group," who rose to power as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> started succeeding <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> at the party's 6th congress, when o was elected member of the 6th politburo and the 6th central military commission.

to be distinguished from the internment camps for political prisoners, the reeducation camp prisoners are forced to undergo ideological instruction after work and they are also forced to memorize the speeches of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and they even have to undergo self-criticism rites.

 thus these prisoners are likely ideologically re-educated  in so called "revolutionizing" areas of the camp – tasks include forced memorization of speeches by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> with specific emphasis placed on re-education of children.

 politburo members under <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> lacked a strong power base and depended on the party leader for their position.

 the rank was created in 1992 when it was awarded to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who was the only holder until 2012, when his successor <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was awarded the title posthumously.

 however, at the same time <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> started grooming his own son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to be his designated successor, and a power struggle erupted.

it was the period when the wpk was focusing ideologically on <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s juche; while <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> actively stood for this process, kim yong-ju, having studied in russia, supported a more classical view of marxism and was not fond of the extensive personality cult built around his brother.

 this played to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s advantage: kim yong-ju was more and more marginalized, his key allies kim to-man (director of propaganda) and  (director of international liaison) were removed, and he himself was finally attacked by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

before an internal propaganda film was released, after the ascension of kim jong-un, there were three attempts made to idolize ko, in a style similar to that associated with kang pan-sŏk, mother of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and kim jong-suk, mother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the first wife of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 it continues the tradition of north korean supreme leaders having hymns dedicated to them, as was the case with kim's grandfather <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> ("song of general <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>") and kim's father <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ("song of general <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>", "no motherland without you").

the first revolutionary opera in north korea, sea of blood, was premiered at the pyongyang grand theatre in july 1971, with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> credited as the author and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> credited as producer.

the writers, actors, and directors of north korean revolutionary opera, under the guiding hands of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, were instructed to produce an opera that was distinctly north korean and distinctly different than previous forms of opera.

 the main theme, "where are you, dear general?", is a paean to general <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, credited to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as composer.

 the second section analyzes themes in the propaganda, including chapters such as "mother korea", <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, perceptions of foreigners, and south korea.

 the book also contains sixteen separate pages of color illustrations, including reprints of posters that ethnically caricature japanese and americans and which portray the late leaders <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as paternal figures.

at the 4th party conference held in april 2012, kim jong-un further defined juche as the comprehensive thought of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, developed and deepened by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, therefore terming it as "kimilsungism-kimjongilism" and that it was "the only guiding idea of the party" and nation.

kang chol-hwan wrote of his childhood in north korea: to my childish eyes and to those of all my friends, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> were perfect beings, untarnished by any base human function.

 according to a 2005 speech by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, sukarno and the garden's director wanted to name the flower after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died in 1994, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> declared a national mourning period for three years.

starting in the early 1970s <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> began to contemplate the succession question, albeit surreptitiously at first, but by 1975 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was referred to as the "party center", or in connection with his father with references to "our great suryong and the party center".

 in 1977, the first confirmation of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s succession by name was published in a booklet which designated the younger kim as the only heir to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, that he was a loyal servant of his father and had inherited his father's virtues, and that all party members were to pledge their loyalty to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 there are approximately 40,000 "research institutes" (total includes both <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s) throughout the country.

 they include a  statue of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> each riding a horse (the first large monument built after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s death) and a  tall statue at mansudae, pyongyang.

 the government has also been replacing statues of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> with updated versions along with new statues of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> beside the ones of his father in each of the provincial capitals and other sites.

 paektu and also includes monuments dedicated to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in the 1990s, kim jong-suk's portrait was even added to those of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, which were displayed in every household and building and treated as sacred objects of veneration and worship.

 furthermore, when referring to the "three great generals of paekdu mountain," a sacred dormant volcano on north korea's northern border with china, north koreans understand this to mean <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, kim jong-suk, and their son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

likewise, in celebration of his father's 60th birthday, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> produced three operas for him, built three monuments, including north korea's arch of triumph, for his 70th birthday in 1982, and upon <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s death in 1994, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> declared three years of mourning before fully claiming leadership of north korea.

images of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> are prominent in places associated with public transportation, hanging at every north korean train station and airport.

between 60,000 and 220,000 gifts to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> from foreign leaders, businesspersons and others are housed in the international friendship exhibition.

 tours are arranged to the exhibition hall whereupon entering and leaving visitors must pay homage by bowing before images of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, as per korean manners and tradition.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was not only descended and born of revolutionary leaders, but he married a revolutionary leader (kim jong-suk) and fathered a revolutionary leader (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>).

 politburo members under <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> lacked a strong power base, and depended on the party leader for their position.

 with the death of o jin-u in 1995, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> remained the only member of the politburo standing committee still alive; the four others (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, kim il, o jin-u, and ri jong-ok) died in office.

 nonetheless, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> also wrote poems, such as one called "brightest star", written in 1992 to congratulate <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> on behalf of the latter's birthday.

bodyguard divisions are divided into at least two sections, section 1 was dedicated to the protection of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and section 2 protected <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 at that congress, only three members (out of nine) served concurrently as full politburo members: <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jung-rin (not a kim family member).

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un have all made use of the practice.

in the 1970s, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> assumed responsibility for arranging his father's tours after being named heir apparent.

 he restudied <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and also studied south korean presidents syngman rhee and park chung-hee.

 it has been played for all three of the past leaders, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un, whenever they enter or leave a public event.

at this congress, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> designated his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as his successor.

 there was no official reason for its postponement, but it was probably due to the fact that wpk general secretary <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the primary reason for the 6th congress was to formalize <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s chosen successor.

significant at the 6th congress was the generational shift within the wpk, with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> planning to formalize the position of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the elected 6th central military commission (cmc) was composed of 19 members, of which <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ranked third (behind <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and o jin-u).

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> became the only officials with seats in all four bodies: the presidium, politburo, secretariat and cmc.

 the plenum saw the disappearance of kim yong-ju (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s brother, considered his chosen successor before <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), kim dong-gyu, ryu jang-sik and ri yong-mu from important party positions.

 however, rumors were confirmed that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> began grooming <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in 1966.

the choice of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s successor met with considerable criticism.

 this ideological outlook may explain why <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> appointed his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, as his successor.

 he played an important role in the administrations of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, achieving the rank of marshal of the korean people's army.

 during the outbreak of the korean war, ri ul-sol was responsible for the care of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim kyong-hui, the children of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 following his death in 1994, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s cult of personality was passed on to his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and then to his grandson, kim jong-un.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was known as the great leader, and his eldest son and successor, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, became known as the dear leader and later the great general.

the kim family (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim jong-un) has been described as a de facto absolute monarchy or "hereditary dictatorship".

 the main branch referred to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s family with kim jong-suk and publicly included <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and kim kyong-hui.

 first published in 1974, the ten principles mandate absolute loyalty and obedience to the ideas of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and later his successor <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, establishing them as the country's supreme political authorities.

in north korea, the ten principles must be memorized by every citizen, and they ensure absolute loyalty and obedience to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and kim jong-un.

after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s death in 2011, the principles were updated to included his name alongside <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s.

 we must honor the great comrades <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as the eternal leaders of our party and the people and as the sun of juche.

 we must make absolute and desperately defend the authority of the great comrades <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the authority of the party.

 we must be thoroughly armed with the revolutionary ideas of the great comrades <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the party’s lines and policies that are the realization of these ideas.

 we must adhere strictly to the principle of unconditional obedience in accomplishing the instructions passed on by the great comrades <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and in the party’s lines and policies.

 we must learn from the great comrades <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and adopt the noble mental and moral presence, revolutionary work methods, and people-oriented work style.

 we must pass down the great achievement of the juche revolution and the songun revolution, pioneered by the great comrade <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and led by comrades <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, from generation to generation, inheriting and completing it to the end.

 north korea's collapse has been predicted for decades, for example, after the korean war, during the economic collapse in the 1990s, after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s death in 1994, after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s death in 2011, and after rumours of kim jong-un's death in 2020.

 in 1994, sam marcy sent a letter to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> expressing his condolences on behalf of the wwp on the death of his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, calling him a great leader and comrade in the international communist movement.

 well before <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s death in 1994, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> had become the day-to-day ruler of the country, and had promoted his own followers to key positions in the army.

after celebrations for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s 70th anniversary (during which he was elevated to the rank of taewonsu, usually translated as grand marshal or generalissimo), on 18 february the politburo announced the convening of the 4th party conference for mid-april 2012 (near the 100th birth anniversary of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) "to glorify the sacred revolutionary life and feats of kim jong il for all ages and accomplish the juche cause, the songun revolutionary cause, rallied close around kim jong un.

kang was a member of the national mourning committees for the deaths of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in 1994, o chin-u in 1995, park song-chol in 2008, kim jung-rin in 2010, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in 2011.

kang was a member of the national mourning committees for the deaths of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in 1994, o jin-u in 1995, choe kwang in 1997, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in 2011.

 the central part of the monument consists of two  bronze statues of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

following <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s death in 2011, a similar statue of him was erected on the north side of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 its central responsibility is to implement the directives and teachings of the suryeongs  [great leaders], <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the director is often referred to as the second most powerful figure in the country, exemplified by the first director of the ogd being <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the founder of the north korean state, and his successor, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (the party general secretary from 1997 to 2011) directing the ogd from september 1973 until his death in 2011.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son and future successor <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, however, called back such biographies and sought to reinforce <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s cult of personality by controlling the works that made reference to him.

 when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> assumed the office of secretary for organizational affairs, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was allowed more time to focus on his writing.

after having discussed his film ideas with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> on 19 october 1983, shin had decided that shin film's first film should be ready by 15 april the next year, the birthday of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 according to paul fischer, author of a <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> production, the film thus "marked a turning point in north korean culture: the very first time that even the citizens with the lowest songbun  were able to see, however subtly, that the world outside the workers' paradise was not the hell <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had told them it was.

 in north korean propaganda, the town is portrayed as a "sacred site of the revolution", where the founding leader <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> won an important battle against the japanese and where his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born.

 through her career, kim was awarded hero of labor, order of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, order of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and order of the national flag (first class).

 some famous revolutionary sites include mangyongdae, the birthplace of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, in pyongyang, and jangjasan revolutionary site and oun revolutionary site associated with the youth of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 taking part in these efforts were some of the first signs of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> rising in political profile thus readying to succeed his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> as the leader of north korea.

 first, during the 1980s and the early 1990s when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was first publicly named in north korean media and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> started giving him official titles and as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> started to face poor health, his son was eventually de-facto leader of north korea.

 the process culminated when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died in 1994 therefore immediately elevating <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as de-jure leader of north korea (though <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> formally reserved the highest position in the government, that of "president" eternally to his dead dad).

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s name was mentioned in public documents, possibly for the first time, indicating that he was already on his way to being the heir-apparent to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 he was the paternal grandfather of the founder of the democratic people's republic of korea, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the great-grandfather of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and great-great-grandfather of the current leader of north korea, kim jong-un.

after arriving in north korea, men had to change into suits and women had to don áo dàis before boarding a bus to mansu hill grand monument, where teams had to place flowers beneath the statues of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and bow to receive next their clue.

 the script avoided use of the honorific chairman to refer to north korea's leaders, and visible propaganda signs avoid mentioning anything about <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, or kim jong-un (while their mandatory portraits were usually either blurred or obscured by the camera angles).

he was a guard and assistant to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> for a long time with ri tu-ik, jo myong-rok, paek hak-rim, and jon mun-sop, and supported his power after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was injured.

 died: <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, 66, american farmer known from the little house on the prairie books written by his daughter, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and the television series adaptation, where he was portrayed by michael landon.

 he was the younger brother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and the younger son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve, the first couple in biblical history.

 young taught that the day would come when black men would again have the priesthood, saying that after "all the other children of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> have the privilege of receiving the priesthood, and of coming into the kingdom of god, and of being redeemed from the four-quarters of the earth, and have received their resurrection from the dead, then it will be time enough to remove the curse from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his posterity.

after many generations of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> have passed from the lines of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and seth, the world becomes corrupted by human sin and nephilim, and god wants to wipe out humanity for their wickedness.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is said to be perfect until he recognises either his sin or <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world.

an area of questioning involved the book of genesis, including questions about whether eve was actually created from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s rib, where <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> got his wife, and how many people lived in ancient egypt.

 indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about mc<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> himself leaving the republican party, but mc<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> had always <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>antly denied that he ever considered doing so.

seth, in judaism, christianity, mandaeism, sethianism, and islam, was the third son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve and brother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel, their only other child mentioned by name in the hebrew bible.

similar to the internalized spiritual death god warns <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve of from eating the forbidden fruit - they do not physically die immediately but over the course of time their bodies age and die - the lord warns <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> that his inappropriate anger is waiting to consume him: "if you do what is right, will you not be accepted? but if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.

 this can be seen with jubilees 4 which narrates that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> settled down and married his sister awan, who bore their first son, the first enoch, approximately 196 years after the creation of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

in jewish tradition, philo, pirke de-rabbi eliezer and the targum pseudo-jonathan asserted that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was not the father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 and so, after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> would not consent to this arrangement, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> suggested seeking god's blessing by means of a sacrifice.

a millennia-old explanation for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> being capable of murder is that he may have been the offspring of a fallen angel or satan himself, rather than being the son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the apocryphal life of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve tells of eve having a dream in which <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> drank his brother's blood.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel, first sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve

 here, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, abel, eve, matthew, and daniel hold a storytelling session, in which are described the three wives of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (a story appearing in the alphabet of sirach); how <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel came to reside in the dreaming; and the natural phenomenon, the 'parliament of rooks'.

according to abū ṭālib al-mufaḍḍal (a-n-naḥawī al-lughawī) ibn salma (9th century), who himself refers to hishām ibn al-kullā, the oud was invented by lamech, the descendant of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the "present day" framing scenes are set during lee <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's command of the pegasus in the latter half of season 2, while "flashback" scenes depict helena <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s command in the period between the cylon attack (shown in the 2003 mini-series) and the reunion with the galactica in the second season.

 his series picked up several years after the tv series ended, and featured apollo in command of the galactica after the death of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a, a grown-up boxey, who was now a viper pilot, and the rediscovery of commander <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the battlestar pegasus, who had started a new colony and was preparing to restart the war with the cylons.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel were the sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the first man.

 lee, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and samuel have long philosophical talks, particularly about the story of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel, which lee maintains has been incorrectly translated in english-language bibles.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s sons, caleb ("cal") and aron – echoing <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel – grow up oblivious of their mother's situation.

in the novel, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, samuel, and lee have a significant conversation in which they realize that since abel died before he had children, they themselves are the descendants of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

  however, this does not correspond to the text of genesis, which states that contemporary humans are descended neither from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> nor abel, but from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve's third son, seth.

dual seedline christian identity proponents— those who believe that eve bore children with satan as well as with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> —believe that eve was seduced by the serpent (satan), shared her fallen state with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> by having sex with him, and gave birth to twins with different fathers: satan's son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son abel.

 according to the "dual seedline" form of christian identity, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> then became the progenitor of the jews in his subsequent matings with members of the non-<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic races.

in the biblical book of genesis, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel are the first two sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve.

 this theory would make the names descriptive of their roles, where abel works with livestock, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> with agriculture—and would parallel the names <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> () and eve ().

 modern scholars typically view the stories of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel to be about the development of civilization during the age of agriculture; not the beginnings of man, but when people first learned agriculture, replacing the ways of the hunter-gatherer.

 both <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel desired to marry <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s beautiful daughter, aclima (arabic: aqlimia).

 this led some scholars, such as sa'id ibn al-musayyib, to think that the sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> mentioned in the quran are actually two israelites, not <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel.

a millennia-old explanation for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> being capable of murder is that he may have been the offspring of a fallen angel or satan himself, rather than being from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the apocryphal life of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve tells of eve having a dream in which <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> drank his brother's blood.

in 1917, during the last months of legal prostitution in storyville, the red-light district of new orleans, louisiana, hattie is a prostitute working at an elegant brothel run by the elderly, co<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>e-sniffing m<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>e nell.

 the account states that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> from the bible, had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men.

 the musical is based on the book of genesis, with act i telling the story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and abel, while act ii deals with noah and the flood.

 the production was directed by john caird, and starred ken page as father, richard lloyd-king as the snake, martin smith as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, shezwae powell as eve, adrian beaumont as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, kevin colson as noah, earlene bentley as mama noah, frances ruffelle as yonah, anthony barclay as japheth, craig pinder as shem, ray shell as ham, hiromi itoh as aysha and ruthie henshall as aphra.

the cast featured william solo as father, adrian zmed as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>/noah, stephanie mills as eve/mama noah, darius de haas as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>/japheth, hunter foster as abel/ham, and kelli rabke as yonah.

  the concert featured ron bohmer as father, ashley brown as eve/mama noah, charl brown as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>/noah, rebecca naomi jones as yonah, and jeremy jordan as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>/japheth.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve are driven out of the garden by father into the wasteland surrounding the garden and have two children, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel ("the expulsion" and "the wasteland").

several years later, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, eve, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and abel continue their lives, hoping and praying that father will one day bring them home to eden.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> complains to abel that their parents won't let them see the world beyond the glen and that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve seemingly let themselves get kicked out of eden ("lost in the wilderness").

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve, deeply worried about <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s safety out in the wasteland, find some comfort in the fact that they have been able to create a life and family for themselves outside of eden ("close to home"), but this peacefulness is once again shattered when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, back from his journey, tells the family that he has found a ring of giant stones, seemingly providing evidence of other humans.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s betrayal quickly leads to a family-wide fight, culminating in <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> threatening to leave forever and taking abel with him.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, beginning to leave, is forcibly stopped by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who slaps <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, which sends him to the ground.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> tells <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that he will kill him and the two attempt to fight, but when abel intervenes, he is thrown off <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who, in his rage, beats him to death with a stone ("the death of abel").

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> leaves the remaining members of his family, telling <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that it should have been him that should be dead.

 she attempts to speak to father about <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s departure from the family, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s grief over the loss of both his sons, the birth of another son, seth, who has since had children of his own, and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s recent death.

  it escalates into a fight, directly mirroring the one between <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> generations ago, and it is only because yonah intervenes that one of the brothers is not killed.

 the crusaders called yokneam "<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> mons", or "mountain of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>" in keeping with the tradition that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (), was murdered at this site.

 the 1994 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> / vampirella flip book reprinted a 1993 vampirella story by writer busiek and artist arthur <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>s from harris' creepy 1993 fearbook.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s lineage in genesis contains two branches: chapter 4 giving the descendants of for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and chapter 5 that for seth that is then continued in later chapters.

genesis gives <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve three children, named <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, abel and seth.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is the first mentioned son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve in the bible.

 the existence of pre-<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ites, la peyrère argued, explained <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s taking of a wife and the building of a city after abel's murder in the book of genesis.

 some pre-<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ite theorists held the view that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> left his family for an inferior tribe described variously as "nonwhite mongols" or that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> took a wife from one of the inferior pre-<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic peoples.

 it followed that if the tribes of judah were supposed to have intermarried with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>’s descendants, the jews were both the offspring of satan and the descendants of sundry nonwhite pre-<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic races.

 identity preacher conrad gaard wrote that the serpent was a "beast of the field", was the father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and since <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> married a pre-<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ite, his descendants were a "mongrel, hybrid race".

 the belief's adherents commonly use it to justify antisemitism and racism by claiming that jews or members of non-white races are the descendants of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the serpent, who they variably interpret to be satan or an intelligent non-human creature which lived before <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve.

 the doctrine frames human history as a conflict between these two races in which the descendants of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> will eventually triumph over the descendants of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and the serpent.

 because the biblical record explicitly names <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> as the father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, the teaching of the serpent seed is considered incompatible with the protestant teaching of biblical infallibility.

 moon believed that both <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel were physically descended from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve, but taught that "<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is in the position of satan's son".

the manuscript is an account of how <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel slew each other and how <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s inheritance therefore passed to his third son, seth.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve had two sons, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel (qayin and heḇel), the first a tiller of the ground, the second a keeper of sheep.

 the most famous of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s children are <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel.

the quran also describes the two sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and abel.

in the second-season episode "pegasus", admiral helena <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> cites <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's closure of the tribunal in denying his request for a jury court-martial for helo and tyrol.

" <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> relates to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a and president laura roslin how she ordered a risky maneuver to escape the initial cylon attack on the twelve colonies.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a recognizes <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as his superior officer, but <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> promises not to interfere with galacticas internal affairs.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> declines to resupply the fleet's civilian ships and integrates the battlestars' crews, transferring apollo and starbuck to pegasus over commander <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's objections.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a reiterates his willingness to follow <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, to both roslin and tigh, and insists that apollo and starbuck obey their transfer orders.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> denies <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's request that helo and tyrol be given a jury court-martial and sentences them both to death for murder and treason.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a demands that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> return them to galactica and orders vipers to escort a marine assault team to pegasus.

a conversation between <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a makes clear that pegasus is much larger, more advanced, and more powerful than galactica.

davis compares <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's defiance of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to apollo's mutiny in "kobol's last gleaming".

 eick says the amount <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a looks at <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in "pegasus" indicates that he respects her.

 moore abandoned several elements of the original-series episode involving <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, "the living legend"; the main similarities in his view are <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> appearing suddenly in the pegasus and being "more of a hardass character than commander <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a.

" moore considers the key differences to be <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s gender and her authority over <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a.

in the episode, admiral helena <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and commander william <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a call a truce but plan to assassinate each other.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a both cancel their plots, but gina escapes from the pegasus brig and kills <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a ordered galactica's vipers launched toward pegasus, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ordered the pegasus vipers to intercept them.

both viper groups seek permission to fire, but neither <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> nor <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a grants it.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a call off their attacks and agree to meet on colonial one as neutral ground.

 later, roslin warns <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a privately that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> will strike against <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a again and urges him to assassinate <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> first.

 realizing that roslin is right about <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a orders starbuck to assassinate <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> once the attack on the cylon fleet concludes.

 likewise, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> directs fisk to take a detachment of marines to galactica to kill <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a after the attack.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a contact fisk and starbuck respectively, but neither gives the order to assassinate.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s decision not to kill <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a demonstrates that she is "human and.

 however, the contrast between <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s decision to pillage her civilian fleet and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's decision to protect his reflects "an issue of character rather than humanizing circumstance" (emphasis clifton's).

starbuck is conflicted over her loyalty to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a and apollo and her hope that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> will help her rescue anders.

amanda keith of the los angeles newspaper group disputes starbuck's assertion in the eulogy that the fleet was safer with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in command; keith attributes starbuck's assessment to dissatisfaction with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a and roslin's leadership and ignorance of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s past misdeeds.

 keith also believes roslin is mistaken in her assessment of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as irredeemable; after all, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> did back down from killing <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a.

instead of giving starbuck the order to kill <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a muses, "it's not enough to survive.

" clifton compares the conflict between <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s urge to fight the cylons and roslin and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's commitment to maintaining civil society to the struggle between <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a and roslin in the miniseries over whether to fight the cylons or flee.

 he cites <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s assassination plots and their regrets over them, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a inspecting his surgical scar, starbuck and fisks's mutual wishes of "good hunting", and apollo and gina's death wishes.

 clifton argues further that roslin pushes for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a to assassinate <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> because she expects her cancer to kill her soon and considers baltar, who as vice president would succeed her, unfit to stand up to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 originally the conflict between <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a was to center around <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s failure to protect civilian decoys during the battle with the cylons despite a promise to roslin.

 at one point during writing, the script explained why roslin does not promote <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a over <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to defuse the situation: roslin knows <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> does not accept her authority as president and would not obey <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's orders.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s code word "case orange" for fisk to kill <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a refers to war plan orange, a contingency plan developed by the american military before the second world war in case of a japanese attack.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s specific directive to "terminate <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's command, starting with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a" is an homage to a line delivered by harrison ford's character in apocalypse now referring to kurtz.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a's code word "downfall" for starbuck to kill <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> refers to the german film of that name or possibly operation downfall, the planned allied invasion of japan at the end of the second world war.

 jacob clifton gave part 1 an a, praising the moral ambiguity around <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s actions, olmos's performance, the editing of the final scene in which <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a give their assassination orders, and starbuck, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a, and fisk's reluctance to participate in the assassination plots.

 he gave part 2 an a+, calling actress michelle forbes (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>)'s performance "wonderful", the battle scenes "awesome", the battle music "[g]rand, wonderful, sad and angry and terrible", and the final scene between <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>a and roslin "candid and weird and perfect and sad.

 she is best remembered for the spate of films like peyton place and m<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>e x that traded on her personal tragedies, but postman, which predates all that, is a stunner—a cruel and desperate and gritty james <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> vehicle that sorely tests lana's skills.

 as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> explains in an early soliloquy, he regards his mortality as an unjust punishment for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and eve's transgression in the garden of eden, an event detailed in the book of genesis.

 furthermore, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s vision of the earth's natural history in act ii is a parody of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s consolatory vision of the history of man (culminating in the coming and sacrifice of christ) presented by the archangel michael in books xi and xii of milton's epic.

 politically his sympathies are not clear; some claim he was a radical, but this is not borne out by known facts, although he knew <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the ageing reformed revolutionist, husband of mary wollstonecraft and father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>; and john hunt, co-founder of the examiner.

commentators have often read the text as autobiographical, with the three central characters standing for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (her father), and percy shelley (her husband).

presumption was seen by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and her father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> on 29 august 1823 at the english opera house shortly after her return to england.

 lauritsen maintains that revisions to frankenstein made in 1823 and 1831 weakened the work, and that while it was ostensibly <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> who revised frankenstein into its 1831 form, it may primarily have been revised by the political philosopher <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 robinson also rejected lauritsen's thesis, arguing that the testimony of authors such as lord byron, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, claire clairmont, charles clairmont, and leigh hunt, as well as the "nature of the manuscript evidence", showed that the work was "conceived and mainly written by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>".

— mary wollstonecraft, english writer and feminist philosopher (10 september 1797), to her husband, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, while dying from the effects of giving birth to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>

 when she found <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> teasing isaac, sarah told abraham to send both <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> away.

early the next morning, abraham brought <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> out together.

 this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by abraham when sarah demanded that he expel <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the book of genesis narrates that god promised <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to beget from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.

 sarah had to get <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) out of her house because, legally, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> would always be the first-born son even though isaac was her natural child.

 in genesis, these include three different accounts of a patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of abraham sending <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> into the desert.

 through <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, abraham fathers <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 sarah then drives <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his mother <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> out into the wilderness (because <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is not her real son and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is a slave), but god saves them and promises to make <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> a great nation.

 although this was abraham's second son (abraham's first son was <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) it was sarah's first and only child.

after isaac had been weaned, sarah saw <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> mocking, and urged her husband to cast out <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> the bondservant and her son, so that isaac would be abraham's sole heir.

 paul contrasted isaac, symbolizing christian liberty, with the rejected older son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, symbolizing slavery; <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is associated with the sinai covenant, while sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son isaac enters.

in the islamic view, the beginnings of mecca are attributed to the biblical figures, abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the civilization of mecca is believed to have started after ibrāhīm (abraham) left his son ismāʿīl (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and wife hājar (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) in the valley at allah's command.

 moses's mother, jochebed, being inspired to send the infant moses in a cradle down the nile river is a frequently cited example of inspiration, as is <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> searching for water for the infant <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites chose to be called saracens in order to identify with abraham's "free" wife sarah, rather than as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>enes, which would have highlighted their association with abraham's "slave woman" <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 the following year he exhibited his first work, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was grown, someone appeared to abraham in a dream and said to him: "keep your vow which you made! god bestowed upon you a boy by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> so that you may sacrifice him" so he said to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>: "let us go offer a sacrifice to god!" so he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> then said to him: "make tight my bonds, so that i will not struggle to pull back your clothes so that none of my blood will be shed on them for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> will see it and be grieved.

 he replied: "by god, his actual intention is to sacrifice you!" he said: "why?!" iblis replied: "he claims that his lord has ordered him to do so!" <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> replied: "he must do what his lord commands, absolutely!" when the young man had rebuffed him, iblis went to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the mother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> who was still at home.

 certain episodes from the life of abraham have been more heavily detailed in islamic text, such as the arguments between abraham and the evil king, nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, which muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in mecca.

1659: abraham casting out <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> & <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> – guilford college collection, greensboro, north carolina

the region, according to islamic tradition, is the birthplace of the islamic prophet muhammad, who was born in mecca, which is locally considered to have been founded by the islamic prophets abraham and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and matriarch <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

according to arab and islamic sources, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm (abraham) brought his son ismāʿīl (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and wife hājar (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) here, for the latter two to stay.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>

 it was during this banquet that sarah happened upon the then teenaged <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> mocking isaac and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> be banished.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> became pregnant with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 she would ultimately demand that abraham send <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> away and so, abraham banished them and sent them into the desert.

 in genesis 17:15, god changes her name to sarah (princess) ("a woman of high rank") as part of the covenant with el shaddai after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> bears abram his first born son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 however, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 she is not portrayed as abraham's sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of terah's brother, haran, and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is not portrayed as abraham's mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that sarah feels for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> during her pregnancy and toward <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 in 1835, corot created a sensation at the salon with his biblical painting agar dans le desert (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in the wilderness), which depicted <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, sarah's handmaiden, and the child <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, dying of thirst in the desert until saved by an angel.

 his chief earlier pictures have a religious interest, shown in such examples as the flight into egypt (1877), or <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (1880, luxembourg); and afterwards his combination of luminous landscape with figure-subjects (souvenir de fête, 1881; journée faite, 1888) gave him a wide repute, and made him the leader of a new school of idealistic subject-painting in france.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the first son of abraham through the egyptian <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (), the common patriarch of the abrahamic religions, and is venerated by muslims as a prophet.

jewish, christian and islamic traditions consider <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to be the ancestor of the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>enes or arabians) and patriarch of qaydār.

 according to muslim tradition, in which he is regarded as an ancestor of muhammad, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> thereby founded a great nation as promised by god in the old testament, and was buried with his mother <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (hājar) next to the kaaba in mecca, under the area demarcated by the semi-circular hijr ismail wall.

  describes the naming of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and god's promise to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> concerning <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his descendants.

 this occurred at the well of beer-lahai-roi, where <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> encountered the angel of the lord, who said to her "behold, you are with child / and shall bear a son; / you shall call him <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, / for the lord has paid heed to your suffering.

rabbinical commentators in the midrash genesis rabbah also say that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s mother <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was the pharaoh's daughter, making <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> the pharaoh's grandson.

 according to genesis 21:21, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> married <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to an egyptian woman, and if rabbinical commentators are correct that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was the pharaoh's daughter, his marriage to a woman she selected could explain how and why his sons became princes.

according to other jewish commentators, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s mother <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is identified with keturah, the woman abraham sought out and married after sarah's death.

 like christians and jews, muslims believe that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the firstborn of abraham, born to him from his wife sarah's slave, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> soon bore <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who was the first son of abraham.

 god then instructed abraham to take <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to the desert and leave them there.

 to commemorate the blessing of the zamzam well god gave to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, muslims run between the safa and marwah hills retracing <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s steps during the rites of hajj.

the name <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is biblical in origin: in genesis 16:1-16; 17:18-25; 21:6-21; 25:9-17, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the son of abraham by the servant <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 at intervals came from his studio such pieces as the red cross knight, abraham offering up isaac, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the wilderness, the death of major peirson, the arrest of five members of the commons by charles the first, the siege of gibraltar, the surrender of admiral dewindt to lord camperdown, the offer of the crown to lady jane grey by the dukes of northumberland and suffolk, the resurrection, and others.

 abraham's firstborn son, through <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, became the progenitor of the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites, generally taken to be the arabs.

 she was so upset by the idea of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> inheriting their wealth, that she demanded that abraham send <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and her son away.

early the next morning, abraham brought <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> out together.

  he also told <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that god  would "make a great nation" of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

the quranic narrative slightly differs from the biblical account: it is allah alone who commands abraham to take <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> down to the desert, later mecca, and leave them there.

 he helped her and said that god heard <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> cry and would provide them with water, and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> found the sacred zamzam well.

 later, mecca was known for its perfection and abundant water and an arab tribe called banu jurhum settled there with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and her son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, because of the presence of the water.

 they further argue that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> were not cast out as claimed by biblical narrative, but they were settled at makkah (paran) for the sake of almighty allah.

 william shakespeare refers to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in the merchant of venice act ii scene 5 line 40 when shylock says "what says that fool of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s offspring, ha?" this line refers to the character launcelot, whom shylock is insulting by comparing him to the outcast <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

in islamic tradition, bakkah is where <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (ismā'īl) settled after being taken by abraham (ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story parallel to the bible's book of genesis (21:14-21)(but see below for the biblical geography).

 genesis tells that abraham gave <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> a bottle of water, and that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ran out of water to drink in beer-sheba.

the islamic tradition holds that a spring gushed forth from the spot where <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had laid <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and this spring came to be known as the well of zamzam.

in addition to the islamic tradition that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> settled in bakkah, the quran relates that abraham came to mecca to help his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> build the kaaba adjacent to the well of zamzam.

 he also appears twice to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, the slave-girl who has abraham's first child, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ().

all three jamarāt represent the devil: the first and largest represents his temptation of abraham against sacrificing <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (ismāʿīl); the second represents the temptation of abraham's wife <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (hājar) to induce her to stop him; the third represents his temptation of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to avoid being sacrificed.

according to islamic tradition, abraham and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, his son by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, built the kaʿbah as the house of god.

according to ibn ishaq, the buraq transported abraham when he visited <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

there is disagreement amongst jewish scholars as to whether keturah was, or was not, the same person as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (known in islam as hājar)—a handmaid of abraham's wife sarah, and abraham's concubine (or, in islamic tradition, his second wife)—who, together with her son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, was sent away by abraham at the insistence of sarah.

 for instance, in the dismissal of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (1653, metropolitan museum of art, new york) maes portrays abraham banishing the handmaiden <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> along with their son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

  by showing <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s despondency and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s isolated posture the work is one of the most moving renderings of this theme, popular with rembrandt's pupils.

a greek source from the fifth century ce, "the ecclesiastical history of sozomen", speaks of how "abraham had bequeathed a monotheist religion" to arabs, that the arabs descended "from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>" and followed jewish practices such as not eating pork.

  the windows in the nave above the east arcade depict the following old testament figures: abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and her child <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, moses, pharaoh's daughter, joshua, and deborah.

in islamic tradition, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm (abraham) left his son ismāʿīl (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and wife hājar (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) in the valley, which muslims believe was a command by god.

 while <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was on either hillside, she was able to see <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and know he was safe.

the "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> chorus", relating to the islamic story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and the angel and the biblical story of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is sung.

the casting out of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> gave birth to abraham's firstborn son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and after sarah gave birth to her own son isaac, she resented <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and made abraham "cast her into the wilderness".

anglo-persian actress zoe sallis, who was cast as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, was originally known as zoe ishmail, until huston decided that she change her name because of its similarity to the name of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, her character's son.

now these are the generations of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, abraham's son, whom <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> the egyptian, sarah's handmaid, bore unto abraham.

in the abrahamic religions, they are named after <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, a prophet according to the quran, the first son of abraham and the egyptian <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> conceived <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> from abraham, and the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites descend from him.

the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ite story begins when abraham (ibrahim) and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (hajar) bear the prophetic child, who was named <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (ismail) in the order of god (allah) through one of his angels.

 god ordered abraham to take his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and wife <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to present-day mecca.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his mother, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, suffered from great thirst.

in the book of exodus, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (; ) is the husband of jochebed and father of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, moses and miriam.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in arabic is spelled  (‘imrān ), was the husband of jochebed and father of moses and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 there was also on the top of the throne a golden candelabrum, on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs adam, noah, shem, abraham, isaac, jacob, and job, and on the seven of the other the names of levi, kohath, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, moses, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, eldad, medad, and, in addition, hur (another version has haggai).

 1597 bc—<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> born to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and his wife jochebed (traditional date)

 a similar genealogy is given in the book of exodus, where it is added that among kohath's sons was one—<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>—who married a woman named jochebed, who was closely related to his father, and they were the biological parents of moses, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and miriam; though some greek and latin manuscripts of the torah state that jochebed was <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s father's cousin, the masoretic text states that she was his father's sister, and the septuagint mentions that she was one of his father's sisters.

miriam ( mīrəyām) is described in the hebrew bible as the daughter of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and jochebed, and the older sister of moses and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the same mary (maryam) is also called a sister of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (hārūn) in one place, and although this is often seen as an anachronistic conflation with the old testament miriam (having the same name), who was sister to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (hārūn) and daughter to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (ʻimrān), the phrase is probably not to be understood literally.

 although the book of genesis affirms that melchizedek was "priest of god most high" (genesis 14:18), the midrash and babylonian talmud maintain that the priesthood held by melchizedek, who pre-dated the patriarch levi by five generations (melchizedek pre-dates <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> by six generations; abraham, isaac, jacob, levi, kehoth, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), was given in his stead to abraham who, in turn, passed it on to his patrilineal descendants, isaac and then to jacob.

 various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>; and, while promises are made to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> about founding a great nation, isaac, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son by his half-sister sarah, inherits god's promises to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> laughed, and "said in his heart, 'shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall sarah, that is ninety years old, bear [a child]?'" immediately after <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s encounter with god, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (age 13), circumcised.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was fourteen years old when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son isaac was born to sarah.

 when she found <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> teasing isaac, sarah told <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to send both <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and hagar away.

early the next morning, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> brought hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> out together.

 according to the bible, reflecting the change of his name to "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>" meaning "a father of many nations", <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the bible, among others the israelites, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites, edomites, amalekites, kenizzites, midianites and assyrians, and through his nephew lot he was also related to the moabites and ammonites.

george segal created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s farewell to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> when sarah demanded that he expel hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the tribes of central west arabia called themselves the "people of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and the offspring of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the "arabized arabs" (mustaʿribah) of central arabia (najd) and north arabia, descending from <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> the elder son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, through adnan (hence, adnanites).

 the book of jubilees claims that the sons of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> intermingled with the 6 sons of keturah, from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and their descendants were called arabs and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites:

 "arabized arabs" () or adnanites, taken to be the descendants of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 but of course we must add since the commandment applies to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as well as to issac, circumcision is the mark uniting those singular peoples, descended from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who recall not only his chastity but above all his dread in the presence of god; who share in that dread, and who understand the dread and the circumcision to be in part their response as mortal, hence reproductive, hence sexual creatures — created in the image of god — to the presence of the holy or pure god who as creator utterly transcends his mortal, reproductive creatures, and especially their sexuality.

 in genesis, these include three different accounts of a patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> sending hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> into the desert.

 through hagar, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> fathers <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the first covenant is between god and all living creatures, and is marked by the sign of the rainbow; the second is with the descendants of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites and others as well as israelites), and its sign is circumcision; and the last, which does not appear until the book of exodus, is with israel alone, and its sign is sabbath.

 jews believe it is the site where <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> tried to sacrifice his son, isaac, while muslims believe that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> tried to sacrifice his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, in mecca.

 although this was <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s second son (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s first son was <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, with hagar) it was sarah's first and only child.

after isaac had been weaned, sarah saw <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> mocking, and urged her husband to cast out hagar the bondservant and her son, so that isaac would be <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s sole heir.

isaac, along with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, is highly important for muslims for continuing to preach the message of monotheism after his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 in the quran, it later narrates that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> also praised god for giving him <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac in his old age (14: 39–41).

elsewhere in the quran, isaac is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, isaac and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, isaac, jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84).

according to the book of idols, descendants of the son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) who had settled in mecca migrated to other lands.

 in both jewish and muslim tradition, the jewish and arab peoples are descended from the two sons of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>—isaac and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, respectively.

 according to muslim tradition, muhammad himself was a hanif and one of the descendants of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found for a historical <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> or <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

", while  commands the believers of islam to "say: we believe in god and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac and jacob and the tribes, and that which moses and jesus received, and which the prophets received from their lord.

 some of those that were mentioned are: adam, noah, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, jacob, moses, and jesus and his apostles are all considered to be muslims in the qur'an.

 the great mosque of mecca, known as the masjid al-haram, is home to the ka'bah, believed by muslims to have been built by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

in the islamic view, the beginnings of mecca are attributed to the biblical figures, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the civilization of mecca is believed to have started after ibrāhīm (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) left his son ismāʿīl (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and wife hājar (hagar) in the valley at allah's command.

 this is another irony in modern politics: the palestinians in truth are blood brothers or cousins of the modern israelis — they are all descendants of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, so to speak.

witnessed in the year 1800 bc with the arrival of the father of the prophets, prophet ibrahīm (the biblical <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) to egypt during the occupation of the hyksos, and he married an egyptian slave girl named hajar (biblical hagar) from pelusium (modern-day northern qantara), and gave birth to prophet isma'īl (the biblical <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>).

 this ritual is based on the islamic tradition that, when god ordered <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to sacrifice his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, satan tempted him three times not to do it, and, each time, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> responded by throwing seven stones at him.

 adam, enoch, noah, eber, shelah, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, lot, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, isaac, jacob, joseph, job, jethro, david, solomon, elijah, elisha, jonah, aaron, moses, zechariah, john the baptist and jesus are mentioned in the quran as prophets of god (see prophets of islam).

 saracens were associated with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites (descendants of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s older son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) in some strands of jewish, christian, and islamic genealogical thinking.

 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites chose to be called saracens in order to identify with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s "free" wife sarah, rather than as hagarenes, which would have highlighted their association with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s "slave woman" hagar.

 to justify this view, it references a passage of the quran, which mentions that the sons of yaʿqūb (jacob) referred to his uncle ismāʿīl (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), father is-ḥāq (isaac) and grandfather ibrāhīm (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) as his ābāʾ ():

many muslims still claim descent from rechab, along with the nearly-universal claim of arabs to be descended from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> through <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (ismail).

 there has been a historical account of rams' horns preserved in the kaaba until the year 683, which are believed to be the remains of the sacrifice of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> - the first son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who most muslims believe was the son <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> tied down and almost sacrificed, and not isaac.

the scriptures have traced the patronymic lineage of the seventy nations to the three sons of noah, as also the lineage of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and of jacob and esau.

the next burial in the cave is that of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons isaac and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

in legends of the jews, rabbi louis ginzberg argues that the binding of isaac is a way for god to test isaac's claim to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and to silence satan's protest about <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> who had not brought up any offering to god after isaac was born, also to show a proof to the world that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of god's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:

 one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari) interpreting the verse "god's perfecting his mercy on <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and isaac" as referring to his making <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> his closest one, and to his rescuing isaac.

according to the islamic faith, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> ( ) was a prophet and messenger of god, and an ancestor to the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ite arabs and israelites.

 muslims believe that the kaaba in mecca was built by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as the first house of worship on earth.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and isma'il (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) further established the rites of pilgrimage, or ḥajj ('pilgrimage'), which are still followed by muslims today.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had two children, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac, who both later became prophets.

 when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was grown, someone appeared to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, invites him to keep his vow.

 when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was grown, someone appeared to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in a dream and said to him: "keep your vow which you made! god bestowed upon you a boy by hagar so that you may sacrifice him" so he said to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>: "let us go offer a sacrifice to god!" so he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains.

the second strand, provided by tabari, states that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was about to sacrifice his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and iblis appeared in form of a man to prevent the sacrifice.

 iblis, the enemy of god, gave up on <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> but then he encountered <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who was behind <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> carrying the wood and the large knife.

 iblis said to her: "oh mother of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>! do you realize where <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is going with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>?" she replied: "they have gone to gather wood for us in the mountains".

 other verses mention the near-sacrifice of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son, whose name is not given but is presumed to be <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as the following verses mention the birth of isaac.

 the quran also repeatedly establishes <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including isaac, jacob and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the quran mentions that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> were the reformers who set up the ka‘bah in mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheism the quran consistently refers to islam as "the religion of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>" (millat ibrahim) and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is given a title as hanif (the pure, "true in faith" or "upright man").

 certain episodes from the life of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> have been more heavily detailed in islamic text, such as the arguments between <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and the evil king, nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, which muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in mecca.

 an important islamic religious holiday, eid al-adha, commemorates <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s willingness to sacrifice his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as an act of obedience to god, before god intervened to provide him with a sheep to sacrifice instead.

 the sacrifice of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>: isaac or <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>?

 examples were often presented and discussed in later jewish exegesis with, according to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> joshua heschel (1907-1972), an ongoing discourse between those who would follow the views of rabbi <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (born 90 ce) that "the torah speaks in human language", compared to the more mystical approach of rabbi akiva ( 50 – 135 ce) that any such deviations should signpost some deeper order or purpose, to be divined.

1659: <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> casting out hagar & <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> – guilford college collection, greensboro, north carolina

the region, according to islamic tradition, is the birthplace of the islamic prophet muhammad, who was born in mecca, which is locally considered to have been founded by the islamic prophets <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and matriarch hagar.

era of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> 

according to arab and islamic sources, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) brought his son ismāʿīl (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and wife hājar (hagar) here, for the latter two to stay.

 she would ultimately demand that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> send hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> away and so, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> banished them and sent them into the desert.

sometime after the birth of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> but before the birth of isaac, sarah and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> travel to gerar, as described in genesis 20, where events took place which mirrored those of mizraim, in which a king, this time abimelech, took an interest in sarah for her beauty and, as he had done in mizraim, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so, believing her unmarried abimelech took her into her house as pharaoh had though, this time, yahweh intervened before he touched sarah, through dreams and plague.

 however, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, hagar, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 she is not portrayed as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of terah's brother, haran, and hagar is not portrayed as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that sarah feels for hagar during her pregnancy and toward <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 the firstborn son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, is considered by muslims to be the father of the arabs.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> - the first-born son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> - has 12 sons/princes (genesis 25:16), and jacob also has 12 sons, who are the progenitors of the twelve tribes of israel.

 muslims hold isaac in deep veneration because they believe that both isaac and his older half-brother <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> continued their father's spiritual legacy through their subsequent preaching of the message of god after the death of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 isaac was the age of 10 when his half-brother <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> went out from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>’s house into the desert.

 in the quran, it later narrates that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> also praised god for giving him <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac in his old age (xiv: 39-41).

elsewhere in the quran, isaac is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, isaac and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); yaʿqūb's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, isaac, jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; iii: 84).

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the first son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> through the egyptian hagar (), the common patriarch of the <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic religions, and is venerated by muslims as a prophet.

in , the birth of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was planned by the patriarch <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s first wife, who at that time was known as sarai.

 god would make of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> a great nation because he was of the seed of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was born, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was 86 years old.

when he was 13 years old, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was circumcised at the same time as all other males in <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s household, becoming a part of the covenant in a mass circumcision.

 god told <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that he would establish his covenant through isaac, and when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> inquired as to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s role, god answered that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> has been blessed and that he "will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and i will make him a great nation.

a year later, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s half-brother isaac was born to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> by his first wife sarah when she was 90 years old (), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ().

on the day of feasting during which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> celebrated the weaning of isaac, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was "mocking" or "playing with" isaac (the hebrew word ,  is ambiguous) and sarah asked <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to expel <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his mother, saying: "get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son isaac.

" her demand was painful for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, who loved  <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> agreed only after god told him that "in isaac your seed shall be called", and that god would "make a nation of the son of the bondwoman" <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, since he was a descendant of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (), god having previously told <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> "i will establish my covenant with [isaac]", while also making promises concerning the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ite nation ().

 the lord's covenant made clear <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was not to inherit <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s house and that isaac would be the seed of the covenant: "take your son, your only son, whom you love and go to the region of moriah.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> gave <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his mother a supply of bread and water and sent them away.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> appeared with isaac at the burial of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

some pre-islamic poetry mentions <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and a sacrifice story, such as the pre-islamic poet "umayyah ibn abi as-salt", who said in one of his poems:  ([the sacrifice] of his first-born of whose separation he [<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>] could not bear neither could he see him surrounded in foes).

also, some of the tribes of central west arabia called themselves the "people of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and the offspring of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>", as evidenced by a common opening of speeches and harangues of reconciliation between rival tribes in that area.

in judaism, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was inclined towards many things <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> considered wicked.

 according to the book of genesis, in the hebrew bible, isaac rather than <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the true heir of the <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>ic tradition and covenant, while at the same time being blessed by god with a great nation.

according to other jewish commentators, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s mother hagar is identified with keturah, the woman <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> sought out and married after sarah's death.

 like christians and jews, muslims believe that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the firstborn of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, born to him from his wife sarah's slave, hagar.

 in other chapters of the quran, however, which date from the medina period, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is mentioned closely with his father <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>: <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> stands alongside <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in their attempt to set up the kaaba in mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> thanks god for granting him <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac in his old age.

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations and jacob's sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, "<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac", when testifying their faith.

 in the quranic narrative of the near-sacrifice of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son, the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, tabari maintained that it was isaac, consistent with the hebrew scriptures.

 hagar soon bore <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, who was the first son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 god then instructed <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to take hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to the desert and leave them there.

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> returned and visited <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> at various times throughout his life.

 at one time, according to a tradition of muhammad, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> had arrived when his son was out and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> visited with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s wife.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> decided to leave before seeing his son, but based upon the complaints <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s wife made in response to his questions, he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home, which was "change his threshold.

 some time after this, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> returned to visit <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and again <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was out.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> talked with <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s new wife and found her answers indicated faith in god and contentment with her husband.

" when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> returned that night, he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s visit.

 islamic traditions hold that the kaaba was first built by adam and that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> rebuilt the kaaba on the old foundations.

the scriptures of the baháʼí faith state that it was <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and not isaac, who was the son <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> almost sacrificed.

the name <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is biblical in origin: in genesis 16:1-16; 17:18-25; 21:6-21; 25:9-17, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> by the servant hagar.

 at intervals came from his studio such pieces as the red cross knight, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> offering up isaac, hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the wilderness, the death of major peirson, the arrest of five members of the commons by charles the first, the siege of gibraltar, the surrender of admiral dewindt to lord camperdown, the offer of the crown to lady jane grey by the dukes of northumberland and suffolk, the resurrection, and others.

 she was so upset by the idea of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> inheriting their wealth, that she demanded that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> send hagar and her son away.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was greatly distressed but god told <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to do as his wife commanded because god's promise would be carried out through isaac; <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> would be made into a great nation as well because he was <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s offspring.

 later, before <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> died, he gave gifts to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and his other sons and sent them away from isaac (gen 25:6).

 <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac buried <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> together (gen 25:9).

early the next morning, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> brought hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> out together.

in islamic tradition, bakkah is where hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (ismā'īl) settled after being taken by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story parallel to the bible's book of genesis (21:14-21)(but see below for the biblical geography).

 genesis tells that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> gave hagar a bottle of water, and that hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> ran out of water to drink in beer-sheba.

 hagar bore ismā'īl (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), when <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was 86, who too would become a prophet of god like his father.

some of the people revered or mentioned in both the quran and the bible include: aaron, abel, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, adam, cain, david, the disciples of jesus, elias, elisha, enoch, eve, ezra, goliath, isaac, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, jacob, jesus, john the baptist, jonah, joseph, lot, mary, moses, noah, the pharaohs of egypt, samuel, saul, solomon, and zachariah.

 400–480), also spelled qusayy, kusayy, kusai, or cossai,  born zayd (), was an <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ite descendant of the prophet <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, orphaned early on he would rise to become king of makkah, and leader of the quraysh tribe.

 according to islamic tradition, he was a descendant of ibrahim (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) through his son isma'il (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>).

 therefore, they are descendants of adnan, who is <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ite arab descendant of prophet isma'il (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), son of ibrahim (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>).

 the scrolls of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and later used by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac.

 that in the old testament, child sacrifice was prohibited, but this prohibition wasn't always obeyed; that a man's sexual history was never an issue (thus no such thing as a virginity requirement for men); the only religiously celibate jews were the essenes, but this was contrary to mainstream judaism; saint peter was married; saint paul thought that saint joseph had fathered jesus; "joseph 'did not know' mary 'until she has given birth to a son'" (she did not remain virgin, according to saint matthew), prophets were both male and female, the priesthood and the rabbinate were for men only, but phoebe was a deacon and junia was an apostle, the bible states that men are superior to women, polygyny was frequent, abortions were so rare that they were not a problem for the authors of the bible, but there was a ritual meant for making unfaithful women abort; the books of the bible were "kind of hypertext", yahweh visited <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> has probably sexually abused isaac; the bible does not state if adam and eve were married; there are biblical laws regulating polygyny, and "concubine" meant "secondary wife"; abishag laid with david but he was impotent, widows, rape victims and divorced women were "used goods", thus unworthy of a priest; the bible is inconsistent on divorce and "pervasively patriarchal"; the ten commandments were intended for jewish men only; marriage meant transfer of property, but women were inferior to real estate; adultery was about property rights; in the hebrew bible there was no ban on men having sex with unmarried women (including prostitutes); in david's time jerusalem had only a few thousand inhabitants; father-daughter incest was only a devaluation of daughter's value; onan was not masturbating; the bible is inconsistent about brother-sister incest; sex with a woman was prohibited during her period, but so is wearing wool and linen; david and jonathan were not sexual partners; sodom's sin was being inhospitable to strangers and "mistreatment of the powerless"; saint jude does not say that sodom's sin was homosexuality; "sacred prostitution" nowhere and "never took place"; the hebrew bible does not say anything about lesbianism, but saint paul thought that god made homosexuals so; jesus said very little about sexuality; the bible is opposed to homosexuality; having sex with prostitutes was seen as a way of losing money and saint paul opposed the use of prostitutes, but "judah's use of a prostitute was normal and acceptable", this also applies to samson, who also foreshadowed suicide bombers; mary magdalene wasn't a prostitute; god has reproductive organs and had a wife/wives; jews were initially polytheist, genesis 1:26-27 says that the elohim were male and female and humans were made in their image; god's sons had sex with women; yahweh is a sexual being, wisdom was god's wife, gods used to have children in many mythologies, israel was god's wife (polygyny wasn't a problem for him); "all theology is metaphor" and yahweh was "an insanely jealous and abusive husband".

eid al kabir (known as eid al-adha elsewhere), or "festival of sacrifice", is an important religious holiday celebrated by muslims worldwide to commemorate the willingness of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> (ʾibrāhīm) to sacrifice his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (ismā'īl) as an act of obedience to god, before god intervened to provide him with a ram to sacrifice instead.

 consequently, while jacob fathered the 12 tribes of israel, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> gave birth to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, while isaac gave birth to esau.

according to traditional islamic belief, zuhrah's father was kilab ibn murrah, a descendant of ibrahim (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) through his son ismail (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>).

 both his parents traced their lineage back to fihr, the progenitor of the quraysh, and further to ismail (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), son of ibrahim (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>).

 due to ali's status as an adnanite, the dynasty can trace its ancestry to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> through his eldest son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

 an incriminating letter lies on the floor, and a biblical painting – probably <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> casting out hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, but possibly christ and the woman taken in adultery – hangs on the wall.

the maqām ibrāhīm () is a small square stone associated with ibrahim (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>), ismail (<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) and their building of the kaaba in what is now the great mosque of mecca in the hejazi region of saudi arabia.

isaac was the age of 10 when his half-brother <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> went out from <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s house into the desert.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was the first son of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>; his mother was hagar.

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and hagar taken to mecca by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and hagar being taken to mecca by <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> in islamic texts is an important part in the story of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, as it brings the focus to mecca and is the beginning of mecca's sanctification as a holy area.

 islamic tradition says <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was ordered by god to take hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to mecca, and later <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> returned to mecca to build the kaaba.

 in many of these accounts, the sakina (something like a wind or spirit sent by god), or the angel gabriel (jibral) guides them to the location of the kaaba, at which point <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> builds it and afterwards, leaves the other two there (other versions discussed below say the construction of the kaaba occurred later and that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> took part in it).

 generally, it is said that hagar asks <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> who he is entrusting herself and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to as he leaves them.

muslims believe that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> was told to sacrifice his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, though the qur'an does not mention the name of the son.

 some versions tell of the devil trying to stop god's command from being obeyed by visiting hagar, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 every time the devil says <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is going to sacrifice <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, each person answers that if god commanded it, they should obey.

 eventually, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> tells <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> about the order and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is willing to be sacrificed and encourages <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> to listen to god.

 often, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is portrayed as telling <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> some combination of instructions to bring his shirt back to hagar, bind him tightly, sharpen the knife, and place him face down, all so that there will be no wavering in the resolve to obey god.

as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> attempts to slay <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, either the knife is turned over in his hand or copper appears on <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> to prevent the death and god tells <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> that he has fulfilled the command.

 since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s son (and a prophet in islam at that), this replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalisation of sacrifice itself, or to the future self-sacrifices of the islamic prophet muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) in the cause of their faith.

 the strongest case for <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in the quran is that directly after the sacrifice narrative, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> is told of the coming of isaac's birth, therefore, it must be <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> who was about to be sacrificed.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> visited <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> in mecca and when he arrived at his home, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was not there.

 instead <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s wife greets <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, but she was not welcoming or generous to him.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> instructed her to tell <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> some version of the statement that he was not pleased with or to change "the threshold of his door.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> once again visited and was met by <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s second wife, as <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was out.

 <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> instructed her to tell <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> some version of the statement that he was pleased with "the threshold of his door.

" when <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> arrived and his wife repeated <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s statement, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> knew it was from his father and kept his wife.

 of those that say <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> took part in the construction, most describe <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> visited <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> a third time in mecca, during which they raised the kaaba.

 some say <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> looked for a final stone, but <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> did not accept the one he brought back.

 as the islamic community became more powerful, some jewish midrash about <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was modified so that he was portrayed more negatively in order to challenge the islamic view that <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and thus the muslims, were the favoured descendants of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>.

 in this manner, muhammad's ancestry leads back to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, joining "original biblical ancestry of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> with a distinctively arab afinal stock," and connecting muhammad with mecca and the kaaba.

 due to ali's status as an adnanite, the dynasty can trace its ancestry to <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> through his eldest son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>.

  reading from top to bottom we have:  in the first light – <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> sacrificing isaac, the raising of lazarus, and the good samaritan;  in the third light – the woman touching the hem of christ's garment, hagar and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and jesus blessing the children;  in the fourth light – the conversion of saul and the prodigal son, in the sixth light – christ and the men in the tombs.

  for example, sam was an imam for noah, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> was an imam for <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, aaron or joshua for moses, simon, john and all the disciples for jesus, and ali and his descendants for muhammad.

 after adam and his son seth, and after six “nātiq” (speaker) – “sāmad” (silent) silsila (noah–shem), (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>–<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>), (moses–aaron or joshua), (jesus–simeon), (muhammad bin ʿabd allāh–ali ibn abu tālib); the silsila of “nātıqs and sāmads have been completed with (muhammad bin ismā‘īl as-ṣaghīr (maymūn al-qaddāh) – ʿabd allāh ibn-i maymūn and his sons).

according to islamic doctrine in the quran, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> together with his son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> raised the foundations of a house, which has been identified by commentators as the kaaba.

 god showed <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> the exact site which was previously built by adam, very near to what is now the well of zamzam, where <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> began work on the construction of the kaaba.

 safa and marwah are two hills between which <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s wife hagar ran, looking for water for her infant son <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, an event which is commemorated in the  ritual of the pilgrimage.

hazarvi believes that there are certain directives of the qur'an pertaining to war which were specific only to muhammad and certain specified peoples of his times (particularly the progeny of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>: the <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites, the israelites, and the nazarites).

another religious reference comes when max is in the market looking for that day's newspaper, when a recitation from the quran can be heard in the background, which cites quran 2:140: "or do you say that <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and isaac and jacob and the descendants were jews or christians? say, 'are you more knowing or is allah?' and who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from allah? and allah is not unaware of what you do.

 an example of this is the bowden bowl given to games where florida state and clemson were coached by the father-son duo of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> respectively.

 this is seen by some as evidence that the stories of abraham, <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>, and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (said to have taken place a thousand years earlier) were written no earlier than the 10th century bce.

 the period of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> and <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>/israel in egypt (genesis 39:50), where they were in favour at the egyptian court and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land, would correspond to the time the hyksos ruled in egypt, during the fifteenth dynasty.

the house of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> (sometimes referred to as the tribe of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>) is a designation which members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds church) apply to the ancient "birthright" tribe of the house of israel (<PERSON>[X]</PERSON>) as it is described in the old testament, made up of the tribes of ephraim and manasseh.

 these modern <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>ites claim, however, that many in their ranks are also of the tribe of manasseh, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s eldest son and a joint-recipient of the 'double portion' of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s birthright blessing upon the heads of his grandsons.

much of the story of the house of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, according to latter-day saints, is reflected in ancient ancestral prophecies, including those made by the patriarch <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> of egypt (many of them now restored through revelation by the lds faith's founding prophet).

<PERSON>[X]</PERSON> went on to further elevate the status of the descendants of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>'s sons to that of full tribes in their own right (gen 41:50).

<CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: the archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of israel:) even by the god of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .

members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, who believe themselves predominantly to be of the ephraimite branch of the house of <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN>, assert that revelations given of god to the prophet <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> smith (jst gen 50), and as contained in the book of mormon (2 ne 3), bear witness that the patriarch <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s firstborn 'double portion' of both progeny and lands with which he blessed his son, <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> of egypt (and his 'double portion'-inheriting grandsons ephraim and manasseh), included the additional 'land' portion of the whole of the american continent — to which (c.

 rachel was <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s divinely intended wife and could hypothetically have given birth to <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> as <PERSON>[X]</PERSON>'s firstborn with rights of primogeniture.

 in this way, laban can be seen as "seeking to uproot all", by attempting to sever the family tree of the patriarchs between <PERSON>[X]</PERSON> and <CHILDREN>[Y]</CHILDREN> before the children of israel could become more than a single small family.
