 [Y] used culture to categorize people and allowed han transfrontiersmen to identify as [X] after assimilating, and ethnicity was regarded as flexible when han chinese and mongols families were moved by kangxi to [X] banners from their original mongol and chinese banners (hanjun, or han banners) .

li yongfang's rewards for surrendering fushun to the jurchens and defecting included promotion in rank, [Y]'s granddaughter as a wife, battling along with [Y] and induction into the jin aristocracy as a chinese frontiersman, which was different from how [Y] handled both the han transfrontiersmen who assimilated into [X] identity and captured han bondservants.

 the [X] banners had two main divisions between the higher ranking "old [X]s" (fo manzhou, fe manju) made out of the main jurchen tribes like the jianzhou whom [Y] and hong taiji created the [X] banners from, and the lower ranking "new [X]s" (chinese transliteration: 伊車滿洲.

 its emphatic counterpart  was considered by [X]s to be the most unusual sound in [X]ic (hence the classical [X]ic's appellation   or "language of the "); for most modern dialects, it has become an emphatic stop  with loss of the later[Y]ty or with complete loss of any pharynge[Y]zation or velarization, .

 (the classical  pronunciation of pharynge[Y]zation  still occurs in the mehri language, and the similar sound without velarization, , exists in other modern south [X]ian languages.

[X]ic has consonants traditionally termed "emphatic"  (), which exhibit simultaneous pharynge[Y]zation  as well as varying degrees of velarization  (depending on the region), so they may be written with the "velarized or pharynge[Y]zed" diacritic () as: .

 in moroccan [X]ic, on the other hand, short  triggers labi[Y]zation of nearby consonants (especially velar consonants and uvular consonants), and then short /a i u/ all merge into , which is deleted in many contexts.

 the 'copenhagen school' (niels bohr, werner heisenberg, max born) developed an operational approach with a complete mathematical form[Y]sm that involves the description of quantum system by vectors ('states') in a sep[X]le hilbert space, and physical quantities as linear operators that act in this hilbert space.

 by then, camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative coloni[Y]sm as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [X]s and berbers by french authorities.

in 1945, following the sétif and guelma massacre after [X] revolts against french mistreatment, camus was one of only a few mainland journ[Y]sts to visit the colony.

 he argued the algerian uprising was an integral part of the "new [X] imperi[Y]sm" led by egypt, and an "anti-western" offensive orchestrated by russia to "encircle europe" and "isolate the united states".

 his position drew much criticism from the left and later postcolonial literary critics, such as edward said, who were opposed to european imperi[Y]sm, and charged that camus's novels and short stories are plagued with colonial depictions - or conscious erasures - of algeria's [X] population.

with [X]ia having united under a single centr[Y]zed state with a formidable military, the region could now be viewed as a potential threat to the neighbouring byzantine and sasanian empires.

 though the byzantines and sassanians were certain to ret[Y]ate, abu bakr had reason to be confident; the two empires were militarily exhausted after centuries of war against each other, making it likely that any forces sent to [X]ia would be diminished and weakened.
