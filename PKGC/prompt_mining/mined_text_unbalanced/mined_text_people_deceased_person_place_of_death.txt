in 631 ce, [X] sent from [Y] a delegation of three hundred muslims to perform the hajj according to the new islamic way and appointed abu bakr as the leader of the delegation.

 nevertheless, the expedition was dispatched, though soon after setting off, news was received of [X]'s death, forcing the army to return to [Y].

 abu bakr, having returned to [Y], calmed umar by showing him [X]'s body, convincing him of his death.

in yathrib, where he was accepted as an arbitrator among the different communities of the city under the terms of the constitution of [Y], [X] began to lay the foundations of the new islamic society, with the help of new quranic verses which provided guidance on matters of law and religious observance.

 since the constitution of [Y], drafted by the islamic prophet [X], the jews and the christians continued to use their own laws and had their own judges.

 on his deathbed,  caliph umar instructed muslims to seek guidance from the quran, the early muslims (muhajirun) who emigrated to [Y] with [X], the [Y] residents who welcomed and supported the muhajirun (the ansar) and the people of the desert.

 after debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should be the year of [X]'s arrival at [Y] (known as yathrib, before [X]'s arrival).

 the years of the islamic calendar thus began with the month of muharram in the year of [X]'s arrival at the city of [Y], even though the actual emigration took place in safar and rabi' i of the intercalated calendar, two months before the commencement of muharram in the new fixed calendar.

[X] instructed his followers to emigrate to [Y], until nearly all his followers left mecca.

 by 622, [X] emigrated to [Y], a large agricultural oasis.

 he gained support from the nomadic tribes to the north and east of [Y]; using propaganda about [X]'s weakness, promises of booty, memories of quraysh prestige and through bribery.

 [X] heard of men massing with hostile intentions against [Y], and reacted in a severe manner.

 the main points of the treaty included: cessation of hostilities, the deferral of [X]'s pilgrimage to the following year, and agreement to send back any meccan who emigrated to [Y] without permission from their protector.

 these benefits included the requirement of the meccans to identify [X] as an equal, cessation of military activity allowing [Y] to gain strength, and the admiration of meccans who were impressed by the pilgrimage rituals.

 [X] required a military and political agreement according to which they "acknowledge the suzerainty of [Y], to refrain from attack on the muslims and their allies, and to pay the zakat, the muslim religious levy.

 it was during such an occasion that [X] met some [Y]ns who would allow him to migrate to [Y], to escape persecution by his opponents in mecca.

as the land of mecca and [Y], the hejaz was where [X] was born, and where he founded a monotheistic ummah of followers, bore patience with his foes or struggled against them, migrated from one place to another, preached or implemented his beliefs, lived and died.

 caliph hasan, and other sons of ali and grandsons of [X] born in [Y]

 by the time of his death, [X] had become the political and spiritual leader of [Y], mecca, the surrounding region, and numerous other tribes in the arabian peninsula.

 ten years after his first revelation in mount hira, a delegation consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of [Y] pledged to physically protect [X] and invited him as a neutral outsider to [Y] to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community, which had been fighting with each other for around a hundred years and was in need of an authority.

among the things [X] did in order to settle down the longstanding grievances among the tribes of [Y] was drafting a document known as the constitution of [Y].

 their opposition was due to political as well as religious reasons, as many jews in [Y] had close links with abd-allah ibn ubayy, who was partial to the jews and would have been [Y]'s prince if not for [X]'s arrival.

  this book was passed down through clandestine circles into the hands of khalaf al-barbarĩ, who traveled to [Y] and was converted to islam by the prophet [X] himself.

according to historians ibn khaldun and ibn hazm, in  968 ja'far ibn [X] al-hasani came from [Y] and conquered mecca in the name of the fatimid caliph al-mu'izz after the latter had conquered egypt from the ikhshidids.

 'abdullah ibn abbas (619–687) — cousin of [X]; buried in jannat al-baqi', [Y]

the usage is further clarified by the constitution of [Y], an early document said to have been negotiated by [X] in ce 622 with the leading clans of [Y], which explicitly refers to jewish, christians 

after [X] and the first converts to islam were forced to leave mecca, the community was welcomed in [Y] by the ansar, a group of pagans who had converted to islam.

 despite [Y] already being occupied by numerous jewish and polytheistic tribes, the arrival of [X] and his followers provoked no opposition from [Y]'s residents.

 upon arriving in [Y], [X] established the constitution of [Y] with the various tribal leaders in order to form the meccan immigrants and the [Y]n residents into a single community, the ummah.

 islamic historian, tabari, suggested that [X]'s initial intentions upon arriving in [Y] was to establish a mosque, however this is unlikely  tabari also claimed that [X] observed the first friday prayer in [Y].

the constitution of [Y] is a document created by [X] to regulate social and political life in [Y].

 in the battle of the trench, the largely outnumbered defenders of [Y], mainly muslims led by islamic prophet [X], dug a trench, which together with [Y]'s natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate.

 he continued with his own version that concentrated on [X]'s flight from mecca and his triumphant return from [Y] years later.

 after his abortive siege of [X] in [Y] at the battle of the trench in 627, he lost his leadership position among the quraysh.

 the marriage may have reduced abu sufyan's hostility toward [X] and abu sufyan negotiated with him in [Y] in 630 after confederates of the quraysh violated the hudaybiyya truce.

 having to contend with challenges to his leadership from the ansar, the natives of [Y] who had provided [X] safe haven from his erstwhile meccan opponents, and the mass defections of several arab tribes, abu bakr reached out to the quraysh, particularly its two strongest clans, the banu makhzum and banu abd shams, to shore up support for the caliphate.

 ali, [X]'s cousin and son-in-law, was recognized as caliph in [Y].

 the remaining principle opposition emanated from husayn ibn ali, abd allah ibn al-zubayr, abd allah ibn umar and abd al-rahman ibn abi bakr, all prominent [Y]-based sons of earlier caliphs or close companions of [X].

 according to a hadith attributed both to [X] and 'a'isha, the women of [Y] were praiseworthy because of their desire for religious knowledge: although female madrasas did exist before the 1970s large strides were made is regards to female education.

in the 7th century, [X] established a green belt around [Y].

 hadiths relay that the early muslim community of [Y] gave the call to prayer from the roof of the house of [X], which doubled as a place for prayer.

" (37:104-105) the quranic state that [X] began in [Y]h sought to protect human dignity, since in a quranic welfare state individuals are free to work and live without the pressures faced by the threat of poverty, and thus can obey god's laws as free individuals, contributing as part of a unified brotherhood working towards achieving humanity's full potential.

maliki school's sources for sharia are hierarchically prioritized as follows: quran and then trustworthy hadiths (sayings, customs and actions of [X]); if these sources were ambiguous on an issue, then `amal (customs and practices of the people of [Y]), followed by consensus of the sahabah (the companions of [X]), then individual's opinion from the sahabah, qiyas (analogy), istislah (interest and welfare of islam and muslims), and finally urf (custom of people throughout the muslim world if it did not contradict the hierarchically higher sources of sharia).

 prior to this revelation, [X] and his followers in [Y] faced jerusalem for prayers.

 these methods included facing the direction that the companions of [X] had used when in the same place; using the setting and rising points of celestial objects; using the direction of the wind; or using due south, which was [X]'s qibla in [Y].

 according to islamic traditions, these verses were revealed in the month of rajab or shaban in the second hijri year (624 ce), or about 15 or 16 months after [X]'s migration to [Y].

 prior to these revelations, [X] and the muslims in [Y] had prayed towards jerusalem as the qibla, the same direction as the prayer direction—the mizrah—used by the jews of [Y].

there are different reports of the qibla direction when [X] was in mecca (before his migration to [Y]).

 some early muslims used due south everywhere as the qibla, literally following [X]'s instruction to face south while he was in [Y] (mecca is due south of [Y]).

 when [X] lived among the muslims in [Y] (which, like mecca, is also in the hejaz region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of mecca.

 1442) recorded various qibla angles used in cairo at the time: 90° (due east), 117° (winter sunrise, the "qibla of the sahaba"), 127° (calculated by astronomers, such as ibn yunus), 141° (mosque of ibn tulun), 156° (the rising point of suhayl/canopus), 180° (due south, emulating the qibla of [X] in [Y]), and 204° (the setting point of canopus).

the second holiest place for muslims is the masjid al-nabawi in [Y], which is where the prophet [X] is buried under the green dome.

 after the passing of [X], imam jafar al-sadiq, imam zayd ibn ali, imams abu hanifa and imam malik ibn anas worked together in al-masjid an-nabawi in [Y] along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars.

 ibn taymiyyah uses a saying (hadith) of the islamic prophet [X] in bukhari and muslim to justify his view that it is not permitted to journey exclusively to any mosque other than the sacred mosques in mecca, [Y], or jerusalem.

according to classical sunni tradition, the islamic prophet [X] foretold the birth of malik, saying: "very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge and they shall find no one more expert than the knowledgeable scholar of [Y]," and, in another tradition, "the people .

 the first mosque was a structure built by [X] in [Y] in 622, right after his hegira (migration) from mecca, which corresponds to the site of the present-day mosque of the prophet (al-masjid an-nabawi).

 the first mihrab, a concave niche in the qibla wall, reportedly appeared at [X]'s mosque in [Y] when it was rebuilt by al-walid i in 707.

 early mosques were constructed according to either the calculations of what direction qibla was approximately, or with the mihrab facing south, as that was the direction that [X] was facing when he prayed in [Y], which is a city directly north of mecca.

 hadiths relay that the early muslim community of [Y] gave the call to prayer from the roof of the house of [X], which doubled as a place for prayer.

 the arab hypostyle mosque constructed by the prophet [X] in [Y] served as a model for mosque design throughout the islamic world.

 [X] ali landed at yanbu, the port of [Y], on 1813.

 it was thus obligatory to emigrate, in emulation of [X]'s hijra to [Y], and establish a legitimate dominion of their own ().

the "remembrance of death" (, tadhkirat al-mawt; deriving from , tadhkirah, arabic for memorandum or admonition), has been a major topic of islamic spirituality since the time of the islamic prophet [X] in [Y].

 abd-allah ibn ubayy (died 631), leading inhabitant of [Y] and contemporary of [X]

 624: jerusalem loses its place as the focal point for muslim prayers to mecca, 18 months after the hijra ([X]'s migration to [Y]).

7th century [X] expelled two jewish tribes: the banu qaynuqa and banu nadir from [Y].

 later, in order to distinguish his followers from adherents of other sufi sects, the mahdi forbade the use of the word darwish (commonly known as "dervish" in english) to describe his followers, replacing it with the title ansar, the term which the prophet [X] used for the people of [Y] who welcomed him and his followers after their flight from mecca.

 at siwa, egypt, 1931, his cousin, sayyida fatima al-shi'fa binti sayyid ahmad as-sharif al-sanussi, fatimah el-sharif (1911 kufra – 3 october 2009, cairo, buried in jannat al-baqi, [Y], saudi arabia), fifth daughter of field marshal sayyid ahmad as-sharif pasha bin sayyid [X] as-sharif al-senussi, 3rd grand seussi, by his second wife, khadija, daughter of ahmad al-rifi, by whom he had one son who died in infancy;

 in 622 ce, in recognition of his claims to prophethood, [X] was invited to rule the city of [Y].

 [Y]ns considered [X] as an impartial outsider who could resolve the conflict.

 [X] and his followers thus moved to [Y], where [X] drafted the constitution of [Y].

the constitution of [Y] was drafted by [X].

 it constituted a formal agreement between [X] and all of the significant tribes and families of yathrib (later known as [Y]), including muslims, jews, christians, and arab pagans.

according to ibn hisham and al-waqidi, 9th-century biographers of the islamic prophet [X], the jewish banu nadir and banu qaynuqa tribes immigrated to adhri'at following their expulsion from [Y].

 ja'far, the ruler of [Y], to return fadak to the descendants of [X] through his daughter, fatima; he restored nikah mut'ah, previously banned by umar ibn al-khattab, but practiced under [X] and abu bakr; in 211 ah/826 ce, al-ma'mun reportedly expressed his antipathy to those who praised mu'awiya ibn abi sufyan, and reportedly punished such people; this later view of al-suyuti however is questionable since it contradicts the fact that al-ma’mun promoted scholars who openly defended muawiyah ibn abi sufyan, such as the mu’tazilite scholar hisham bin amr al-fuwati, who was a well-respected judge in the court of al-ma’mun in baghdad; in 212 ah/827 ce, al-ma'mun announced the superiority of ali ibn abu talib over abu bakr and 'umar b.

 although pre-islamic influences are evident in their works, the [Y]n perspective of muslim history evolved as a theocentric (god-centred) universal history of prophecy, culminating in the career of [X] and not as a continuum of tribal wars and values.

 from the beginning of the muslim era (dated from 622, the date of the hijrah—the prophet [X]’s migration from mecca to [Y]), the history is arranged as a set of annals according to the years after the hijrah.

ibn ishaq was born in [Y] in 704 (85 ah), with [X] being his birth name.

 mālik rejected the stories of [X] and the jews of [Y] on the ground that they were taken solely based on accounts by sons of jewish converts.

the first recorded minbar in the islamic world was [X]'s minbar in [Y], created in 629 ce (or between 628 and 631 ce) and consisting simply of two steps and a seat, resembling a throne.

according to majority of narrations, husayn was born on 5th of sha'ban 4 ah (10 january 626 ce) in [Y] and was still a child when his grandfather, [X], died.

 in 656 he was killed by the provincial rebels in [Y], then capital of the caliphate, after which ali, the cousin and son-in-law of [X], was recognized as caliph by the medinese people and the rebels.

 the idea was scandalous to muslims, as hereditary succession had no precedent in islamic history—earlier caliphs had been elected either by popular support in [Y] or by the consultation of the senior companions of [X]—and according to islamic principles, the position of ruler was not the private property of a ruler to award to his descendants.

after the third caliph uthman's assassination by rebels in 656, the rebels and the townspeople of [Y] declared ali, a cousin and son-in-law of the islamic prophet [X], caliph.

 following the battle [X] ali sent a letter to abdullah requesting his submission, and in may 1815 an agreement was made which terminated abdullah's claims over two holy cities, mecca and [Y], and the recognition of the supremacy of the ottoman sultan.

al-masjid an-nabawi (), known in english as the prophet's mosque, is a mosque built by the islamic prophet [X] in the city of [Y] in the al madinah province of saudi arabia.

 it was the second mosque built by [X] in [Y], after masjid quba', and is the second largest mosque and second holiest site in islam, both titles ranking after the masjid al-haram in mecca.

 al-ansari also accommodated [X] upon his arrival at [Y] in 622.

the mosque was built by [X] in 622 ce (1 ah) after his arrival in [Y].

 after migrating to [Y] and establishing a brotherhood pact between the muslims, [X] chose him as his brother.

from migration to [Y] to the death of [X]

in 622, which later marked the beginning of the islamic calendar, [X] was informed of an assassination plot by the meccan elites and it was ali who is said to have slept in [X]'s bed instead of him in order to frustrate the assassins' plan and facilitate [X]'s safe escape to yathrib (now [Y]).

shia sources report that, shortly after the migration to [Y], [X] told ali that god had commanded him to give his daughter, fatima, in marriage to him.

after the migration to [Y], [X] paired muslims for fraternity pacts and he is said to have selected ali as his brother, once telling him, “you are my brother in this world and the hereafter,” according to nasr and afsaruddin.

ali accompanied [X] in nearly all of his military expeditions except the battle of tabuk, during which he was left behind in charge of [Y].

while ali was preparing [X]'s body for burial, a group of the ansar ([Y]n natives, ) gathered at saqifah with the deliberate exclusion of the muhajirun () to discuss the future of muslims.

 ibn abbas relates that it was when ali facilitated [X]'s safe escape to [Y] by risking his life that verse 2:207 was revealed, praising him, "but there is also a kind of man who gives his life away to please god.

 after the islamic prophet [X] moved to [Y] in 622 ce, he made peace treaties with the jewish tribes of arabia and other tribes.

in 627 ce, jewish tribe banu qurayza of [Y] violated a treaty with [X] by allying with the attacking tribes.

 islamic literature also describes a parallel relation between their people and the incidents that occurred in their lifetimes; the exodus of the israelites from ancient egypt is considered to be similar in nature to the migration of [X] and his followers from mecca to [Y] as both events unfolded in the face of persecution—of the israelites by the ancient egyptians, and of the early muslims by the meccans, respectively.

 ali ibn abi talib, who participated in several other expeditions of [X], did not participate in [X]'s tabuk expedition upon [X]'s instructions, as he held command at [Y].

 some authors have noted that the surviving companions of [X] were mostly in ali's army and must have also pledged their allegiance to hasan, as evidenced by the lack of any reports to the contrary from kufa, [Y], and mecca.

 the umayyad governor of [Y], sa'id ibn al-'as, was not opposed to burying hasan near [X] but marwan strongly objected, arguing that uthman had been buried in al-baqi.

 shortly after the migration to [Y], shia sources report that [X] followed divine orders and gave ali the hand of his daughter, fatima, in marriage.

 this classification is only approximate in regard to the location of revelation; any chapter revealed after migration of [X] to [Y] (hijrah) is termed [Y]n and any revealed before that event is termed meccan.

[X] took keen interest in capturing meccan caravans after his migration to [Y], seeing it as repayment for his people, the muhajirun.

 abu sufyan, learning of the muslim plan to ambush his caravan, changed course and took a longer route away from [X]'s base at [Y] and sent a messenger to mecca, asking for help.

the muslim victory strengthened [X]'s position; the medinese eagerly joined his future expeditions and tribes outside [Y] openly allied with [X].

after the hijra (migration to [Y]) in 623 ce, the population of [Y] chose [X] to be the leader of the community.

 [X]'s followers decided to raid the caravans of the makkans as they passed by [Y].

"[X] then praised him and supplicated for him, but the three who had spoken were of the muhajirun, who only constituted around one-third of the muslim men in [Y].

three days after the battle, [X] left badr for [Y].

 the first was [X], who was transformed overnight from a meccan outcast into the leader of a new community and city-state at [Y].

 at the same time 'abd allah ibn ubayy, [X]'s chief opponent in [Y], found his own position seriously weakened.

[X] in [Y].

in his mother's house, al-sadiq also interacted with his grandfather qasim ibn [X] ibn abi bakr, who was respected by the people of [Y] as a famous traditionalist.

[X] al-baqir was born in [Y], about the time when muawiyah was trying to take the oath of allegiance for his son, yazid.

 al-kulayni writes that the prophet's only surviving companion, jabir ibn abd allah, commonly addressed [X] ibn ali as "o baqir al-'ilm," telling the [Y]ns about [X]'s prophesy, "o jabir! you will meet a man from my family who will have the same name and the same characteristics as mine.

yahya ibn harthama, the captain of the guard, is narrated to have reported his experience as follows: "the caliph mutawakkel sent me to [Y] with orders to bring ali ibn [X] to answer certain accusations that had been made against him.

 to escape persecution, [X] and his companions, including the qurayshi abu bakr, emigrated to [Y].

 in later anti-umayyad muslim tradition, marwan was derided as tarid ibn tarid (outlawed son of an outlaw) in reference to his father al-hakam's alleged exile to ta'if by the islamic prophet [X] and marwan's expulsion from [Y] by ibn al-zubayr.

 he installed as governor of [Y] abu bakr ibn [X] al-ansari, a member of the city's pious circles, despite his family's role in the fatal rebellion against the early clansman and patron of the umayyads, caliph uthman (), revenge for whom had served as an ideological rallying point and foundational event for the umayyad dynasty.

 later, he facilitated [X]'s safe escape to [Y] by risking his life as the decoy.

 in [Y], ali swore a pact of brotherhood with [X] and later took the hand of [X]'s daughter, fatimah, in marriage.

 ali commonly acted as [X]'s secretary in [Y], and served as his deputy during the expedition of tabuk.

 the latter's nomination was supported by his paternal uncle, the famous general maslama ibn abd al-malik, hisham's maternal grandfather, the former governor of [Y] hisham ibn isma'il al-makhzumi, and his sons ibrahim and [X], and the sons of the influential banu abs chief of northern syria, al-qa'qa' ibn khulayd.

 al-walid appointed his uncle yusuf ibn [X] governor of [Y].

 after these military exploits, abbas brought his family to live in [Y], where [X] frequently visited them and even proposed marriage to his daughter.

 (or ah) – for the latinized anno hegirae, meaning "in the year of the hijra", [X]'s emigration from mecca to [Y] in september 622, which occurred in its first year, used in the islamic calendar.

 around [Y], captain [X] ould ali raho of the french military mission carried out his first railway demolition attack in february 1917.

muhajirun, the early muslims ([X] and his companions) who migrated from mecca to [Y] in modern-day saudi arabia

in islām, companions of muḥammad are classified into categories including the muhajirūn who accompanied [X] from mecca to [Y], the ansar who lived in [Y], and the badriyyūn who fought at the battle of badr.

two important groups among the companions are the muhajirūn "migrants", those who had faith in [X] when he began to preach in mecca and who departed with him when he was persecuted there, and the ansar, the people of [Y] who welcomed [X] and his companions and stood as their protectors.

according to the history of the prophets and kings, after the death of the islamic prophet [X], abu bakr, umar and abu ubaidah ibn al-jarrah and the anṣār of [Y] held consultations and selected abu bakr as the first caliph.

the 92 meccan suras, believed to have been revealed to [X] in mecca before the hijra, deal primarily with , or "the principles of religion", whereas the 22 [Y]n suras, believed to have been revealed to him after the hijra, deal primarily with sharia and prescriptions of islamic life.

 the green dome sepulcher of the islamic prophet [X] (where his burial chamber also contains the tombs of his friend abu bakr and close companion umar) in [Y], housed in the masjid an-nabawi ("the mosque of the prophet"), occurs as a greatly venerated place and important as a site of pilgrimage among muslims.

wael hallaq notes that by contrast with [Y] and to a lesser extent syria, in iraq there was no unbroken muslim or ishmaelite population dating back to the prophet [X]'s time.

additionally, imam [X] al-baqir and his son jafar al-sadiq made decisions from [Y] that contributed to the law of kufa; and to this day shi‘ite law follows their example.

 according to sunni muslim tradition, ibn abbas narrated that [X] came to [Y] and saw the jews fasting on the tenth day of muharram.

 the local governor, [X] ibn salih ibn al-abbas, sent hammad ibn jarir al-tabari against them with a mixed force, comprising regular troops as well as inhabitants of [Y], from the ansar families and the quraysh.

 the traditional biographies of [X] describe the expulsion of the banu qaynuqa in the post badrperiod, after a marketplace quarrel broke out between the muslims and the jews in [Y] and [X]'s negotiations with the tribe failed.

 [X] besieged the banu nadir and expelled them from [Y].

 [X] also attacked the jews of the khaybar oasis near [Y] and defeated them, after they had betrayed the muslims in a time of war, and he only allowed them to stay in the oasis on the condition that they deliver one-half of their annual produce to muslims.

 [X] was not killed by the jewish community and he was ultimately victorious in his clash with the jewish community in [Y].

 the word is commonly used to refer to the journey of the islamic prophet [X] and his followers from mecca to [Y] in the year 622.

in may 622, after having convened twice with members of the [Y]n tribes of aws and khazraj at al-'aqabah near mina, [X] secretly left his home in mecca to emigrate to the city, along with his friend, father-in-law and companion abu bakr.

 prophet [X]'s arrival at [Y] was warmly welcomed, resulting in the renaming of the city from yathrib to al madinah al munawwarah (arabic: المدينة المنورة‎, romanized: al-madīnah al-munawwarah, lit.

during dhu al-hijjah of the year 620 ce, [X] convened with some members of the banu khazraj tribe from [Y] near the al-'aqabah hill in mina just outside of mecca, propounded to them the doctrines of islam, and recited portions of the quran.

 these twelve informed [X] of the beginning of gradual development of islam in [Y], and took a formal pledge of allegiance at [X]'s hand, promising to accept him as a prophet, to worship none but one god, and to renounce sins including theft, adultery, and murder, in what is now known as the first pledge of al-'aqabah.

 the following year, in 622, a delegation of around 75 muslims consisting of members of both the aws and khazraj from [Y] restated the terms of the first pledge and also assured [X] of their full support and protection if the latter would migrate to [Y] as an arbitrator to reconcile among the aws and khazraj.

 following the pledges, [X] encouraged his followers to migrate to [Y], and in a span of two months, nearly all the muslims of mecca migrated to the city.

 he would later leave for [Y] with his mother, fatima bint asad, muhammed's daughters fatimah and umm kulthum, as well as two other women, [X]'s wife sawda and wetnurse umm ayman.

the rise of islam begins around the time [X] and his followers took flight, the hijra, to the city of [Y].

 from 622 to 632, [X] as the leader of a muslim community in [Y] was engaged in a state of war with the meccans.

 one of the king's titles is custodian of the two holy mosques, the two mosques being masjid al-haram in mecca (which contains islam's most sacred place, the kaaba), and al-masjid al-nabawi in [Y], which contains [X]'s tomb.

  in  the  year  of  hijra,  the  year  during  which  the emigration of the prophet [X] from mecca  to  [Y]) occurred  to  determine  sacred  days, regulated clock mechanism and put the flag on the minaret,  to  signal  the  simultaneous  beginning  of the prayer to other islamic places of worship in the town of belgrade.

 between 20 and 24 february 2009, shia pilgrims from the heavily shia eastern province who had come to [Y] for the anniversary of [X]'s death clashed with sunni religious police at the baqi' cemetery over doctrinal differences concerning the rituals surrounding commemoration of the dead.

 according to records, its first stones were positioned by [X] as soon as he arrived on his emigration from the city of mecca to [Y], and the mosque was completed by his companions.

 [X] spent 14 days in this mosque praying qaṣr (, a short prayer) while waiting for ali to arrive in [Y], after the latter stayed behind in mecca to safeguard [X]’s life and safe escape by sleeping in [X]’s bed in his place, an event referred to in the quran, sura al baqara verse 207.

 it comprised the names of the warriors of [Y] who participated in the muslim conquests and their families, and was intended to facilitate the payment of salary (ʿaṭāʾ, in coin or in rations) to them, according to their service and their relationship to [X].

 it describes the battles fought by [X], as well as [X]'s life in the city of [Y].

commentary works of al-waqidi were much larger than those of the oldest prophetic biography  ibn ishaq (died 767)  despite the fact that al-waqidi's later works covered a shorter period of time (only [X]'s period in [Y]).

 in the first phase, abu bakr dispatched four armies from [Y] in late 633 led by the commanders amr ibn al-as, yazid ibn abi sufyan, shurahbil ibn hasana, all veterans of the ridda wars,  and abu ubayda ibn al-jarrah, a leading companion of [X].

when [X] arrived at [Y] from mecca in september 622 c.

 according to historical records, after the arrival of [X], the houses of [Y] developed near al-baqi', which was therefore considered as the public tomb.

during the construction of the prophet's mosque, on the site he purchased from two orphan children when he arrived after his migration from mecca to [Y], as'ad ibn zurarah, one of [X]'s companions died.

 while [X] was outside [Y] for the battle of badr, his daughter ruqayyah fell sick and died in 624.

 this is consistent with his assertion that mariya bore [X]'s son ibrahim in late march or april 630, so mariya had arrived in [Y] before july 629.

in 623 ce, when [X] migrated from mecca to [Y], abu ubayda also migrated.

 when [X] arrived in [Y], he paired off each immigrant (muhajir) with one of the residents of [Y] (ansari), joining [X] ibn maslamah with abu ubayda making them brothers in faith.

unlike the present day islamists, prophet [X], when he established the first islamic state in [Y] – actually a jewish-muslim federation extended to religious minorities the rights that are guaranteed to them in the quran.

  prophet [X]'s [Y] was based on the covenant of [Y], a real and actual social contract agreed upon by muslims, jews and others that treated them as equal citizens of [Y].

 the epoch (reference date) of the islamic era was set as 622 common era (ce), the year of the emigration of [X] and his followers from mecca to [Y], known as the hijra.

 later, he was sent by a sick uncle to get a remedy from [X] at [Y] and on this occasion was much influenced by a part of the koran, shortest surah, 'al-kawthar'.

 after coming into conflict with the elite of mecca, [X] fled to the city of yathrib, which was renamed [Y].

 after the death of [X] he used to deliver lectures in masjid nabwi, [Y], egypt, and damascus.

it is said that twelve months after moving to [Y], [X] himself led a caravan raid to waddan (al-abwā).

sometimes, abd allah ibn mas'ud (died ), an early convert who had served as [X]'s personal assistant in [Y], and who was well known for his knowledge of the quran, was also reckoned among the ten.

 this list, which like the list of the ten  entirely consists of members of the quraysh who emigrated with [X] from mecca to [Y] ('emigrants' or ), appears to have functioned as a direct rival to another list of twelve 'apostles', which consisted entirely of non-qurayshi muslims ('helpers' or ).

 the banu khuza'ah at once sent a delegation to [Y] to inform [X] of this breach of truce and to seek his help.

[X] in [Y]

al-qāsim ibn [X] ibn abi bakr was one of the seven most famous jurists in [Y], and was considered as the most knowledgeable among them.

ali migrated to [Y] shortly after [X].

 for the ten years that [X] led the community in [Y], ali was extremely active in his service, leading parties of warriors on raids, and carrying messages and orders.

after the assassination of the third caliph, uthman ibn affan, the sahabah (companions of [X]) in [Y] selected ali to be the new caliph.

in 622 ce, the year of [X]'s migration to yathrib (now [Y]), ali risked his life by sleeping in [X]'s bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot, so that [X] could escape in safety.

 then he went to [Y] with fatimah bint asad (his mother), fatimah (the daughter of [X]), and two other women.

 though it was well known through many traditions related by [X] and in the quran as to who was to succeed [X] (ali), a small number of prominent companions took to the "saqifah banu sa'ida" or saqifah, a roofed building used by the tribe of sa'ida, in the city of [Y], to decide amongst themselves as to who was going to lead the muslims.

miqdad later embraced islam and become early converts of the new religion founded by [X], before he migrated to [Y] due to persecution from meccan polytheists.

 in [Y], miqdad were known in history as brave companion of [X] and stated by muslim historians as the first muslim horsemen, miqdad participated in all military operations under [X].

at some point during umar reign, when miqdad in [Y], he along with zubayr, and the caliph son, abdullah ibn umar, went to khaybar to collect their profit share as they have shareholding of the properties and plantations in khaybar, which were managed and worked by the jewish tribes of khaybar, who has been subdued during the time of [X].

besides his major involvement in islam's military campaigns, this incident in [X]'s life proved to be of most importance -historically- to muslims: while ʻammār was participating in building the prophet's mosque in [Y], (quoting a hadith) "[and he] came in when they had overloaded him with bricks saying, 'they are killing me.

 the qurayshi meccans, led by abu sufyan ibn harb, commanded an army of 3,000 men toward [X]'s stronghold in [Y].

 eager to exact revenge upon [X], he vowed to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of [Y].

 [X] and many of the wise senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within [Y] and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds.

 shortly before the battle commenced, 'abdallah ibn ubayy, chief of the khazraj, along with 300 other men, withdrew their support for [X] and returned to [Y], with reports suggesting ibn ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from [Y] to meet the meccans.

 according to watt, this was because [X] realized that a show of force was required to speed the meccans away from the [Y]n territory.

[X] in [Y].

ten years after [X]'s migration to [Y] and on the last days of dhu al-qadah, [X] performed the hajj rituals in mecca, shortly before his death.

 when the rituals of hajj ended, [X] set off on the return journey from mecca towards [Y], accompanied by an entourage of muslims.

 at the same time, according to nasr and his coauthors, the link between verse 5:67 and the events that followed the farewell pilgrimage, including the sermon at ghadir khumm, is most plausible since chapter () five of the qur'an is often associated with [X]'s final years in [Y].

the hawazin and their allies, the thaqif, began mobilizing their forces when they learned from spies that [X] and his army had departed from [Y] to begin an assault on mecca.

the film was shot in morocco and libya, with production taking four and a half months to build the sets for mecca and [Y] as imagined in [X]'s time.

the closest the film comes to a depiction of [X] or his immediate family are the view of ali's famous two-pronged sword zulfiqar during the battle scenes, a glimpse of a staff in the scenes at the kaaba or in [Y], and [X]'s camel, qaswa.

 watt's comprehensive biography of the islamic prophet [X], [X] at mecca (1953) and [X] at [Y] (1956), are considered to be classics in the field.

 [X] at [Y] (1956)  (online)

 after eight days' journey, [X] entered the outskirts of [Y] on 28 june 622, but did not enter the city directly.

in [Y], [X]'s first focus was on the construction of a mosque, which, when completed, was of an austere nature.

after the arrival of [X] in [Y], its people could be divided into four groups:

in order to establish peaceful coexistence among this heterogeneous population, [X] invited the leading personalities of all the communities to reach a formal agreement which would provide a harmony among the communities and security to the city of [Y], and finally drew up the constitution of [Y], also known as the [Y] charter, which formed "a kind of alliance or federation" among the prevailing communities.

 muslim historians mention that through the treaty, the quraysh recognized [X] as their equal counterpart and islam as a rising power, and that the treaty mobilized the contact between the meccan pagans and the muslims of [Y] resulting in a large number of quraysh conversion into islam after being attracted by the islamic norms.

 [the jews] killed them, and also tried to kill the prophet [X] in [Y].

tala al-badru alaynā (arabic: ) is a traditional islamic poem known as nasheed that the ansar sang for the islamic prophet [X] upon his arrival at [Y].

 it is located north of [Y] and mecca is south and [X] arrived at quba which is south, so it is geographically impossible that it was sung at the hijrah, some say.

the alternative opinion mainly put forth by ibn hajar al-asqalani is that it was sung for [X] upon his arrival at [Y], to welcome him after completing the battle of tabuk.

 it was used in the soundtrack of the 1976 film the message, directed by moustapha akkad, and used in scene depicting [X]'s hijra to [Y]

[X] in [Y]

 when [X] announced this intent, approximately 100,000 of his sahaba gathered in [Y] to perform the annual pilgrimage with him.

[X] had lived in [Y] for 10 years since the hegira and had not partaken in any hajj pilgrimage, although he had performed the umrah on two previous occasions.

 the muslims in [Y] and the surrounding regions gathered with [X] to undertake the journey.

 [X] appointed abu dujana al-ansari as the governor of [Y] during his absence.

 in 1925, the commander and later-king of saudi arabia, abdulaziz ibn saud, destroyed the manmade structures in jannat al-baqīʿ in [Y], the burial place of four of the shia imams and of [X]'s daughter.

notable are the jewish tribes that had settled in [Y], they would play a prominent part in [X]'s life, this included the banu qurayza, banu nadir and the banu qainuqa, they participated in the battle of bu'ath, although they had a truce and an agreement with muslims not to join the opposing armies, but they broke them.

 the delegation embraced islam during this meeting, though the 9th-century historians al-waqidi and umar ibn shabba hold uthman had already converted to islam during a previous visit to [X] in [Y], but had kept it secret from his tribe.

according to his daughter, huyayy opposed [X] from the day he arrived in [Y].

 huyayy agreed to give it to him, but as [X] was waiting by the wall of one of their houses their plan to assassinate him became apparent, he hurried away along with his companions and returned to [Y].

huyayy came to ka'b ibn as'ad, the chief of the banu quraiza in [Y], but failed to incite him to war against [X].

 the day after the confederates lifted the siege against [Y], [X] besieged the fortress of the qurayza, and they surrendered in may 627.

 malik rejected the stories of [X] and the jews of [Y] on ground that they were taken solely based on accounts by sons of jewish converts.

 parwez's thesis was that the organizational model of the state is the basic engine which drives the implementation of the quran, and like [X] in [Y], those who wish to practice islam, as it is defined in the quran, are required to live in a state which submits to the laws of god, and not the laws of man.

, after the hegira (migration) to [Y], the prophet [X] and his believers faced jerusalem while praying salah between 610 to 623 a.

[X] ibn maslamah was born in [Y] c.

ibn maslama embraced islam at the hands of mus'ab ibn umayr before his fellow aus clansmen sa'd ibn mu'adh and usaid bin hudair, and before prophet [X]'s and meccan muslims immigration to [Y] around the year of 621-622 ad.

 later, when the nadir tribe surrendered to prophet [X] and were expelled from [Y], it was ibn maslamah who supervised their exit and collected all their confiscated property and weapons.

 it is recorded that ibn maslamah was ordered to be in all military campaigns by prophet [X], with the exception of  expedition of tabuk, for on that occasion prophet [X] appointed him as the governor of [Y].

[X] ibn maslamah died in [Y] in may/june 663 or april/may 666 aged about 75.

 she and her daughter, together with her mother, sister and niece, were among the first women in [Y] who gave allegiance to [X].

 the jewish source states that they went to war against each other in the battle of bu'ath a few years before the islamic prophet [X] migrated to [Y].

[X] came to [Y] as a mediator, invited to resolve the feud between the banu aws and the banu khazraj.

 they were also in [Y] during [X]'s era.

jewish chronicles state that they went to war against each other in the battle of bu'ath a few years before the islamic prophet [X] migrated to [Y].

the islamic prophet [X] came to the city of [Y] following the migration of his followers in what is known as the hegira (migration to [Y]) in 622.

a delegation from [Y], consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of [Y], invited [X] as a neutral outsider to serve as the chief arbitrator for the entire community.

 the delegation from [Y] pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept [X] into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.

[X] instructed his followers to emigrate to [Y] until virtually all of his followers had left mecca.

 by 622, [X] had emigrated to [Y], then known as yathrib, a large agricultural oasis.

among the things [X] did in order to settle the longstanding grievances among the tribes of [Y] was drafting a document known as the constitution of [Y] (date debated), establishing a kind of brotherhood among the eight [Y]n tribes and muslim emigrants from mecca, which specified the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in [Y] (including that of the muslim community to other communities specifically the jews and other "peoples of the book").

 [X]'s adoption of facing north towards jerusalem when performing the daily prayers (qibla) however need not to necessarily be a borrowing from the jews as the reports about the direction of prayer before migration to [Y] are contradictory and further this direction of prayer was also practiced among other groups in arabia.

 in the constitution of [Y], [X] demanded the jews' political loyalty in return for religious and cultural autonomy in many treaties.

 after his migration to [Y], [X]'s attitude towards christians and jews changed "because of experience of treachery".

 [X] and his followers saw in the victory a confirmation of their faith and a prime importance in the affairs of [Y].

 this marked an end to the overt opposition to [X] among the pagans in [Y].

[X] expelled from [Y] the banu qaynuqa, one of the three main jewish tribes.

 [X] and many of the senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within [Y] and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds.

 following the defeat, [X]'s detractors in [Y] said that if the victory at badr was proof of the genuineness of his mission, then the defeat at uhud was proof that his mission was not genuine.

 in order to raise a more powerful army, abu sufyan attracted the support of the great nomadic tribes to the north and east of [Y], using propaganda about [X]'s weakness, promises of treasure, memories of the prestige of quraysh and straight bribes.

 when [X] heard of men massing with hostile intentions against [Y], he reacted with severity.

 around a year later, [X] expelled the jewish banu nadir from [Y].

 in dealing with [X]'s treatment of the jews of [Y], aside from political explanations, arab historians and biographers have explained it as "the punishment of the [Y] jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old.

 peters, a western scholar of islam, states that [X]'s treatment of jews of [Y] was essentially political being prompted by what [X] read as treasonous and not some transgression of the law of god.

 peters argues that [X]'s treatment of the jews of [Y] was "quite extraordinary", "matched by nothing in the qur'an", and is "quite at odds with [X]'s treatment of the jews he encountered outside [Y].

 [X] should send back any meccan who had gone to [Y] without the permission of his or her protector (according to william montgomery watt, this presumably refers to minors or women).

following the conquest of mecca and these events, [X] would perform the farewell pilgrimage and return to [Y], where he would fall ill for several days with a headache and weakness.

ansari — from ansar, [Y] people who helped prophet [X]

the banu sa'ida () was a clan of the banu khazraj tribe of [Y] in the era of [X].

one banu najjar group is mentioned in the charter of [Y], and the banu najjar of [Y] were the maternal clan of [X]'s grandfather abdul-muttalib.

[X] initially settled with them when he emigrated from mecca to [Y].

after the entry of [X] in [Y], many of the arabs converted to islam.

being second only to [X], ibn ubayy became a "figurehead for those arabs of [Y] who, openly or secretly, sneered at the prophet's teaching and complained of the confusion and the danger which the coming of the muslims had brought to [Y]".

 his plea implies that [X] intended to put the qaynuqa to death, as he later did with the banu qurayza, but after ibn ubayy's intercession, they were merely expelled from [Y], their property falling to [X] and the muhajirun.

in the consultations preceding the approaching meccan attack on [Y] in 625, ibn ubayy had favored [X]'s original plan to defend from the strongholds inside [Y] itself:

 ibn ubayy then led his men back to [Y], retiring to the strongholds, while [X] resumed his advance.

 the quraish, however, did not succeed in killing [X], and did not attempt to occupy the town of [Y], possibly because they knew it was guarded by ibn ubayy.

 ibn ishaq writes that when [X] ordered the tribe to leave the city within ten days, "certain persons of [Y] who were not believers sent a message to the banu al-nadir: 'hold out, and defend yourselves; we shall not surrender you to [X].

 ibn ubayy denied having said so and [X] accepted the excuse, but after their return to [Y], the "munafiqun" would be reprimanded in surah .

in 630, when [X] launched a campaign against the byzantine empire during a time of drought and food shortage created serious discontent in [Y], ibn ubayy  expressed his sympathy for those criticizing the expedition as untimely.

 as the army assembled, ibn ubayy's troops formed a separate camp and turned back to [Y] when [X]'s forces set out.

as the persecution of early muslims in mecca continued, [X] asked his followers to emigrate to [Y], whose residents had pledged to protect [X].

 [X] and abu bakr both resided in this cave for three days, after which they continued their journey to [Y].

 the expedition was ordered by [X] after he received intelligence that the banu muharib and banu talabah tribes, were planning to raid the outskirts of [Y].

 [X] ordered his men to invade duma, because [X] received intelligence that some tribes there were involved in highway robbery and preparing to attack [Y] itself this happened in july 626.

[X] in [Y].

 it existed in [Y] during [X]'s time, but at less than today's rates.

 after experiencing the isra and mi'raj in 620 and receiving delegations from [Y] and pledges of protection from the two arab tribes that lived in the city at al-'aqabah, [X] instructed his companions to gradually migrate to the city, before doing so himself in 622.

 [X]'s paternal great-grandmother, salma bint 'amr, was an influential jewish lady from the khazraj tribe of [Y], thus [X] had mixed arab-jewish ancestry.

 [X] met with a few members of the two tribes of [Y], the aws and khazraj, twice, at a hill known as al-'aqabah near mina, where they pledged their allegiance to [X] and agreed to protect [X] if he were to migrated to [Y].

 following the pledges at al-'aqabah, [X] encouraged his followers to emigrate to [Y].

muslims believe [X] waited until he was commanded by allah to migrate to [Y].

 ali then went to [Y] with his mother, fatima bint asad, and muhammed's daughters, fatimah and umm kulthum as well as two other women, [X]'s wife, sawda, and wetnurse, umm ayman.

 to further delude the quraysh, [X] travelled south for the first few days of his journey, in the opposite direction to [Y].

 later, [X] and abu bakr turned to the red sea, following the coastline up to [Y], arriving at quba' on monday, 27 september 622.

 her brothers asked prophet [X] to return her to them, in accordance with the treaty, which stated that muslims who escaped from mecca to [Y] should be returned to their families.

 [X] and the nascent muslim community had taken refuge in [Y] as a result of their exile from mecca.

[X] ibn al-hanafiyyah ([X] akbar) was born in [Y] about ad 633 (though also said to be during umar's era), the third of ali's sons.

 after the death of [X], the people of yamamah were declared apostates by the muslims for refusing to pay the zakat (religious tax); the men were killed (see ridda wars), and the women were taken to [Y] as slaves, khawlah bint ja'far among them.

this period was preceded by that of [X] in [Y], and began after the conquest of mecca, which was the result of the violation of the treaty of hudaybiyyah, signed between the muslims and the quraysh as a 9 year, 9 month and 9 day armistice in the year 629.

the treaty of hudaybiyyah was a pact signed between [X] and the quraysh in the year 629, following [X]'s departure from [Y] to perform the umrah pilgrimage.

 abu sufyan, leader of the quraysh in mecca, aware that mecca could not prepare a force matching the strength of [X]'s, left for [Y] in an attempt to restore the treaty, but [X] refused to accommodate him, and abu sufyan returned to mecca.

 the hawazin and their allies, the thaqif, began mobilizing their forces when they learnt from their spies that [X] and his army had departed from [Y] to begin an assault on mecca.

after 12 years of the persecution of muslims by the meccans, [X] and his companions performed the hijra ("emigration") in ad 622 to the city of yathrib (current-day [Y]).

 there, with the [Y]n converts (the ansar) and the meccan migrants (the muhajirun), [X] in [Y] established his political and religious authority.

 the caliph umar ibn abd al-aziz set up the influential committee, the seven fuqaha of [Y], headed by qasim ibn [X] ibn abi bakr.

an islamic oral tradition holds that during the hijra, the journey from mecca to [Y], [X] and his companion abu bakr were being pursued by quraysh soldiers, and they decided to take refuge in the cave of thawr.

 they maintained close ties with the quraysh of mecca and the inhabitants of [Y], and fought in a number of battles against the islamic prophet [X] before ultimately converting to islam before his death in 632.

during [X]'s activities in mecca and [Y], the sulaym, as their qurayshi allies, were hostile to [X] and his message.

 an exception among the tribesmen was safwan ibn mu'attal, a member of the dhakwan in [Y] who became a companion of [X].

the two primary arab tribes of [Y], the aws and the khazraj, had been battling each other for the control of [Y] for more than a century before [X]'s arrival.

 with the pledges of al-aqaba, which took place near mina, [X] was accepted as the common leader of [Y] by the aws and khazraj and he addressed this by establishing the constitution of [Y] upon his arrival; a document which regulated interactions between the different factions, including the arabian jews of [Y], to which the signatories agreed.

 the result was the eventual formation of a united community in [Y], as well as the political supremacy of [X], along with the beginning of a ten-year long diplomatic career.

the main defining moments of [X]'s career as a diplomat are the pledges at al-aqabah, the constitution of [Y], and the treaty of hudaybiyyah.

in the summer of 620 during the pilgrimage season, six men of the khazraj travelling from [Y] came into contact with [X].

 following the pledge, [X] decided to dispatch a muslim ambassador to [Y] and he chose mus'ab ibn 'umair for the position, in order to teach people about islam and invite them to the religion.

with the slow but steady conversion of persons from both the aws and khazraj present in [Y], 75 [Y]n muslims came as pilgrims to mecca and secretly convened with [X] in june 621, meeting him at night.

 the people of [Y] agreed to the conditions of the first pledge, with new conditions including included obedience to [X], the enjoinment of good and forbidding evil.

 watt argues that there must have been several meetings between the pilgrims and [X] on which the basis of his move to [Y] could be agreed upon.

[X] as the leader of [Y]

although formal combat between the two clans had ended, hostilities between them continued even up until [X]'s arrival in [Y].

 [X] had been invited by some [Y]ns, who had been impressed by his religious preaching and manifest trustworthiness, as an arbitrator to help reduce the prevailing factional discord.

after the pledges at al-'aqaba, [X] received promises of protection from the people of [Y] and he migrated to [Y] with a group of his followers in 622, having escaped the forces of quraysh.

 bernard lewis writes the community at [Y] became a new kind of tribe with [X] as its sheikh, while at the same time having a religious character.

 watt argues that [X]'s authority had not extended over the entirety of [Y] at this time, such that in reality he was only the religious leader of [Y], and his political influence would only become significant after the battle of badr in 624.

the result was [X]'s increasing influence in [Y], although he was most probably only considered a political force after the battle of badr, more so after the battle of uhud where he was clearly in political ascendency.

 to attain complete control over [Y], [X] would have to exercise considerable political and military skills, alongside religious skills over the coming years.

 following the signing of the treaty, [X] and the pilgrims sacrificed the animals they had brought for it, and proceeded to return to [Y].

there are instances according to islamic tradition where [X] is thought to have sent letters to other heads of state during the [Y]n phase of his life.

[X] zakariya fell ill on sunday 16 may 1982 in the city of [Y], saudi arabia.

 [Y] is the final place-of-residence of [X], and where his qabr (grave) is located.

the al-masjid an-nabawi or the prophet's mosque in [Y], contains the grave of the islamic prophet [X].

 [X] had received intelligence that some tribes there were involved in highway robbery and preparing to attack [Y] itself.

many scholars of islam took this as a classification of the sura as stemming from the earlier meccan period and argued that the pope was mistaken by pointing out that surah 2 was revealed in various stages and that this verse was revealed after [X]'s hijra from mecca, during his period of stay in [Y], and hence is from the [Y]n period, which was the final stage of the revelation of the qur'an when the muslims were becoming numerous and increasingly powerful and safe from the immediate dangers that had overshadowed them for 13 years in mecca.

 this information was immediately sent to [Y], causing [X] to summon his council of sahaba to decide how they should handle the matter.

 aside from huge portions [Y] war veterans, [X] also enlisted some tribes who had already accepted to islam and come to his aid in the event of great opposition.

later after the muslim army has been returned to [Y], amr immediately reported to [X] there is personal commentary account from 'amr himself who explained this strategy to [X] saying he instructed this because he want his men to fight in united stance under the cover of darkness of night, without being separated too far each others, so the enemy does not realized their numbers.

the ansar () were the local inhabitants of [Y] who, in islamic tradition, took the islamic prophet [X] and his followers (the muhajirun) into their homes when they emigrated from mecca during the hijra.

 as [X] managed to convince many notables of both aws and khazraj, which also included abbad ibn bishr who personally convinced by a muhajirun named mus'ab ibn umayr of his cause on his new faith, the chieftains of both aus and khazraj tribe, particularly sa'd ibn mu'adh, usaid bin hudair, saʽd ibn ʽubadah, and as'ad ibn zurara agreed to embrace islam and appoint [X] as arbitrator and de facto leader of [Y].

according to early muslim sources, [X] is buried in the al-masjid an-nabawi ("mosque of the prophet") in the city of [Y] in saudi arabia.

[X]'s first interaction with the people and tribes of syria was during the invasion of dumatul jandal in july 626 where he ordered his followers to invade duma, because [X] received intelligence that some tribes there were involved in highway robbery and preparing to attack [Y] itself.

[X] died in june 632, and abu bakr was appointed caliph and political successor at [Y].

 he wrote that while [X] was in mecca, he "did not have many supporters and was very weak compared to the pagans", and "it was at this time he added some 'soft', peaceful verses", whereas "almost all the hateful, coercive and intimidating verses later in the quran were made with respect to jihad" when [X] was in [Y] .

 karen armstrong claims that there are "far more numerous passages in the quran" which speak positively of the jews and their great prophets, than those which were against the "rebellious jewish tribes of [Y]" (during [X]'s time).

william muir, like many other 19th-century scholars divides [X]'s life into two periods—meccan and [Y]n.

watt rejects the idea that [X]'s moral behavior deteriorated after he migrated to [Y].

 watt interprets incidents in the [Y]n period in such a way that they mark "no failure in [X] to live to his ideals and no lapse from his moral principles.

 the hanifa of the yamama also supplied skilled laborers who found work in mecca; the islamic prophet [X] is known to have employed them for the production of clay used to build his mosque in [Y] and held high opinions of the hanafi workers.

 he had already been a kahin (soothsayer) and proclaimed himself a prophet and messenger in his native village of haddar, located in the yamama valley of falj, before [X] had embarked on the hegira (emigration from mecca to [Y], a momentous event in [X]'s life which marked the start of the islamic calendar) in .

 the direction of prayer is called the qibla; the early muslims initially prayed in the direction of jerusalem before this was changed to mecca in 624 ce, about a year after [X]'s migration to [Y].

[X] and the jewish tribes of [Y]

many [Y]ns converted to the faith of the meccan immigrants both before and after [X]'s emigration, but only a few came from jewish backgrounds because most of the jewish community rejected [X]'s status as a prophet.

 watt also states that many of the jews had close links with abd-allah ibn ubayy, "the potential prince of [Y]" who "is said that but for the arrival of [X], had not become" the chief arbitrator of the community.
