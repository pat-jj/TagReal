 [X], like other territories that formed the crown of aragon, rose up in support of the austrian habsburg pretender charles vi, holy roman emperor, in his claim for the spanish throne as charles iii of [Y].

 in retaliation for the betrayal, and inspired by the french absolutist style of government, the first bourbon king introduced the nueva planta decrees, that incorporated the lands of the crown of aragon, including the principality of [X], as provinces under the crown of castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, as well as their  politics, within a united kingdom of [Y].

 boí, a village in [X], [Y]

 despite the reconquest of barcelona by [Y] in 1652, the kings of france held on to the part of [X] north of the pyrénées, where catalan institutions remained.

  inspired by the ideas of herder, savigny and the entire scottish school of common sense, they asked why the catalans were different from other spaniards — especially the castilians (conversi 1997: 15) for example, cortada wanted to determine why, despite its poor natural environment, [X] was so much more successful economically than other parts of [Y].

 as vilar observes: "it is only because, in its acquisition of the spanish market, the catalan industrial bourgeoisie did not succeed either in securing the state apparatus or identifying its interests with those of the whole of [Y], in influential opinion, that [X], this little "fatherland", finally became the 'national' focal point", (1980: 551)

unlike in the rest of [Y], the industrial revolution made some progress in [X], whose pro-industry middle class strove to mechanize everything, from textiles and crafts to wineries.

furthermore, barcelona's industrial elite wanted [X] to stay part of [Y] since [X]'s industrial markets relied on consumption from other spanish regions which, little by little, started to join some sort of development.

 as stanley payne observes: "the modern catalan élite had played a major role in what there was of economic industrialization in the nineteenth century, and had tended to view [X] not as the antagonist but to some degree the leader of a freer, more prosperous [Y]" (482).

 the inclusion of [Y] was instrumental to [X]'s success, meaning that industrialists would not tolerate any secessionist movement.

 and hence, though manufacturers funded the renaixença—and catalan nationalism—they demanded that [X] stayed part of [Y] to ensure economic stability.

 payne notes: "the main catalanist party, the bourgeois lliga, never sought separatism but rather a more discrete and distinctive place for a self-governing [X] within a more reformist and progressive [Y].

in 1931, the left-wing catalan nationalist esquerra republicana de catalunya (republican left of [X], erc) party, born as a result of the fusion of catalan republican party and estat català, won the elections in [X], advocating a catalan republic federated with [Y] the same day of the proclamation of the second spanish republic.

 the other way around also occurs: some voters may vote for non-nationalist parties (especially the initiative for [X] greens, icv, and the socialists' party of [X], psc) for reasons of policy, ideology or personal preference, although they share a nationalist viewpoint regarding [X]'s status within [Y].

 the soviet union was boycotting the un for recognizing [X] (republic of [Y]) as [Y], and [Y] (people's republic of [Y]) on the mainland was not recognized by the un, so neither could support their ally north korea at the security council meeting.

 the term "hán (korean) war" () is most commonly used in [X] (republic of [Y]), hong kong and macau.

 in the first scenario: if the pva continued attacking in full and the un command was forbidden to blockade and bomb [Y], and without [X]ese reinforcements, and without an increase in us forces until april 1951 (four national guard divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in north korea.

 in the second scenario: if the pva continued full attacks and the un command blockaded [Y] and had effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the chinese interior, and the [X]ese soldiers were maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing was to hand, then the un forces could hold positions deep in north korea.

 the kmt opposes de jure [X] independence, chinese unification under "one country, two systems" and any non-peaceful means to resolve the cross-strait disputes, instead favoring a closer relation with the prc and maintaining [X]'s status quo under the constitution of the republic of [Y].

 the party also accepts the 1992 consensus, which defines both sides of the [X] strait as "one [Y]" but maintains its ambiguity to different interpretations.

 although the kuomintang lost mainland [Y] in 1949, the republic of [Y] under kuomintang was able to achieve the political ideal of a democratic republic of [Y] on [X] based on the three principles of the people after its retreat to [X].

gamal abdel nasser cut off the diplomatic relations with the republic of [Y] on [X] and established the new tie with the people's republic of [Y] in 1956.

 throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s the prc recognized only north korea while south korea in turn recognized only the republic of [Y] in [X].

[Y] maintains diplomatic relations with ten countries in oceania: australia, fiji, the federated states of micronesia, kiribati, new zealand, papua new guinea, samoa, the solomon islands, tonga and vanuatu whilst [X] has diplomatic relations with the other four.

also in 2006, wen became the first chinese premier to visit the pacific islands, which the taipei times described as "a longtime diplomatic battleground for [Y] and [X]".

] in terms of the pacific, there is a more disturbing game being played out, namely the 'chequebook diplomacy', that is taking place between [Y] and [X] in their competition for diplomatic recognition at the expense of the other.

 [X] matters profoundly to [Y]—and it is largely why [Y] is interested in the pacific.

in june 2008, a report from the lowy institute stated that [Y]'s aid policy towards the pacific was almost certainly aimed solely at encouraging pacific countries not to grant diplomatic recognition to [X], and that there was no sign of the prc attempting to increase its military influence or its access to the region's natural resources.

in february 2008, australia reportedly "chastised [X] for its renewed push for independence" and "reiterated its support for a one-[Y] policy".

" the author suggested that [Y] did not wish to risk antagonising fiji and thus unwittingly push the bainimarama government towards seeking aid from [X]: "[Y] clearly finds itself boxed into a corner.

 on the other, [Y] faces the risk of losing a fiji starved of funds to its renegade province, [X].

 the embassy statement insisted that relations between the two countries were mutually beneficial, reasserted chinese claims to [X], and concluded: "it is our sincere hope that the local [png] media will report on [Y] and its relations with png in a just and objective way, so as to further enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of our two countries.

 prior to 1971, the kuomintang-held republic of [Y] (roc) based on the island of [X] held [Y]'s un seat, but, as of that date, the people's republic of [Y] successfully lobbied for kmt regime's removal from the un and took control of the seat, supported by soviet union as well as communist states, united kingdom, france, and other western european states, and the third world countries like india.

 the prc claims the de jure administration of [X] province, as well as mainland-nearby islands of kinmen and matsu islands, currently controlled by the republic of [Y].

territorial disputes listed above as between the prc and roc ("[X]") stems from the question of which government is the legitimate government of [Y].

treaties signed on behalf of [Y] before 1949 are applicable only to the republic of [Y] on [X].

a republic of [Y] citizen who does not have household registration () in the area administered by the roc  is classified as a national without household registration (nwohr; ) and is subject to immigration controls when clearing roc border controls, does not have automatic residence rights, and cannot vote in [X]ese elections.

 in a statement released on 13 july 1999 by the foreign ministry of [X], under president lee teng-hui stated that "legally, historically, geographically, or in reality", all of the south [Y] sea and the islands were [X]'s territory and under [X]ese sovereignty.

 [Y] has urged [X] to cooperate and offered [X] a share in oil and gas resources while shutting out all the other rival claimants.

 the united states has regularly ignored [X]'s claims in the south [Y] sea and does not include [X] in any talks on dispute resolution for the area.

on may 9, 2014, [X] reiterated its claim to the paracel islands, rejecting all rival claims amidst the standoff and repeating its position that all of the paracel islands, spratly islands, macclesfield bank and pratas islands belong to the republic of [Y] along with "their surrounding waters and respective seabed and subsoil", and that [X] views both vietnam and mainland [Y]'s claims as illegitimate.

  this statement was released by [X]'s ministry of foreign affairs, which added – "there is no doubt that the republic of [Y] has sovereignty over the archipelagos and waters.

 the delay was largely because the chinese insisted that canada have no relations whatsoever with "the chiang kai-shek gang" as they called the kuomintang regime in [X] and agree to support the chinese position that [X] was a part of the people's republic, a position that caused problems on the canadian side as it implied canadian support for [Y]'s viewpoint that it had the right to take [X] by force into the people's republic.

 by contrast, the name guóyǔ continued to be used by the republic of [Y] which, after its 1949 loss in the chinese civil war, was left with a territory consisting only of [X] and some smaller islands in its retreat to [X].

in both mainland [Y] and [X], the use of mandarin as the medium of instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the spread of mandarin.

 as a result, mandarin is now spoken by most people in mainland [Y] and [X], though often with some regional or personal variation from the standard in terms of pronunciation or lexicon.

 over subsequent decades, the republic of [Y] has become commonly known as "[X]", after the main island.

 the people's republic of [Y] (prc) claims that [X] is chinese territory and that itself has replaced the roc government in 1949, becoming the sole legal government of [Y].

  the prc's one-[Y] principle states that [X] and mainland [Y] are both part of [Y], and that the prc is the only legitimate government of [Y].

 on 18 june 1999, seven servicemen were killed when [Y]n border guard posts were attacked in [X].

before the wake of the [X]i invasion had settled, a series of bombings took place in [Y] (in moscow and in volgodonsk) and in the [X]i town of buynaksk.

 the results of the investigation, and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by achemez gochiyaev, who remains at large, and ordered by khattab and abu omar al-saif (both of whom were later killed), in retaliation for the [Y]n counteroffensive against their incursion into [X].

in late august and early september 1999, [Y] mounted a massive aerial campaign over chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded [X] earlier in the same month.

 by mid-december the [Y]n military was concentrating attacks in southern parts of chechnya and preparing to launch another offensive from [X].

 increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local militants continued in [X], while sporadic fighting erupted in the other southern [Y] regions, such as ingushetia, and notably in nalchik on 13 october 2005.

 on 2 march 2004, following a number of cross-border raids from georgia into chechnya, ingushetia, and [X], gelayev was killed in a clash with [Y]n border guards while trying to get back from [X] into georgia.

 since 2005, the insurgency has largely shifted out of chechnya proper and into the nearby [Y]n territories, such as ingushetia and [X]; the [Y]n government, for its part, has focused on the stabilization of the north caucasus.

the attack also marked the end to the mass terrorism in the north caucasus separatist conflict until 2010, when two [X]i female suicide bombers attacked two railway stations in [Y].

 military analyst vitaly shlykov praised the effectiveness of [Y]'s security agencies, saying that the experience learned in chechnya and [X] had been key to the success.

in response to the insurgent threats, [Y]n special forces cracked down on suspected terrorist organizations, making several arrests and claiming to have curbed several plots, and killed numerous islamist leaders including eldar magatov, a suspect in attacks on [Y]n targets and alleged leader of an insurgent group in the babyurt district of [X].

 the spelling [X] transliterates the [Y]n name, which lacks the voiced velar fricative.

 at the same time, his conduct in office has been questioned by domestic dissenters, as well as foreign governments and human rights organizations, for his handling of internal conflicts in chechnya and [X], his record on internal human rights and freedoms, his relations with former soviet republics, and his relations with the so-called oligarchs: [Y]n businessmen with a high degree of power and influence within both the [Y]n government and economy.

 in the course of the 19th century, qajar iran had to irrevocably cede the region (alongside its territories in [X], north caucasus) as a result of the two russo-persian wars of that century to imperial [Y].

after two wars in the first half of the 19th century, namely the russo-persian war (1804-1813) and the russo-persian war (1826-1828), the [Y]n empire conquered most of the south caucasus (and [X] in the north caucasus) from the iranian qajar dynasty, severing historic regional ties with iran.

 by the treaty of gulistan that followed after the 1804-1813 war, iran was forced to cede modern-day [X], eastern georgia, and most of the azerbaijan republic to [Y].

 as berezovsky explained later in interviews to de waal and goldfarb, udugov proposed to coordinate the islamists' incursion into [X], so that a limited [Y]n response would topple the chechen president aslan maskhadov and establish a new islamic republic, which would be anti-american but friendly to [Y].

it was also alleged that alexander voloshin, a key figure in the yeltsin administration, paid basayev to stage the [X] incursion, and that basayev was working for the [Y]n gru at the time.

 [Y] has been openly terrorizing [X], it encircled three villages in the centre of [X], did not allow women and children to leave.

" al-khattab, who was reportedly close with basayev, said the attacks were a response to what the [Y]ns had done in karamakhi and chabanmakhi, two [X]i villages where followers of the wahhabi sect were living until the [Y]n army bombed them out.

for muhammad al-`ubaydi, scholar of militant islam, his continued relevance is due to the fact that he was the internationalist salafi jihadi fighter par excellence, being born in saudi arabia but fighting in afghanistan, tajikistan, [X], and finally in chechnya, and he was able to speak, besides arabic: [Y]n, english, farsi, chechen, pashto,  and kurdish, his charisma attracting fighters from different ethnic groups, while also being a pioneer of jihadi media, especially when it came to using videos for propaganda.

 not long after his arrival he married an ethnic lak woman from [X], the sister of nadyr khachiliev, an islamist and leader of the union of the muslims of [Y], which has been seen as a way to already internationalize the chechen struggle.

on 22 december 1997, over a year after the signing of the khasav-yurt treaty and the end of the first war in chechnya, the arab mujahideen and a group of [X]i rebels raided the base of the 136th armoured brigade of the 58th division of the [Y]n army in buinaksk, [X].

 while their program of united resistance to [Y]n conquest was popular, uniting ichkeria/mishketia with [X] was not necessarily (see shamil's page), especially as some chechens still practiced the indigenous religion, most chechen muslims belonged to heterodox sufi muslim teachings (divided between qadiri and naqshbandiya, with a strong qadiri majority), rather than the more orthodox sunni islam of [X]; and finally, the rule of ichkeria by a foreign ruler not only spurred distrust, but also threatened the existence of ichkeria's indigenous "taip-conference" government structure.

 at only one year into the conflict, five distinct forces with separate interests had formed with influence in chechnya: the terek cossacks, the "bourgeois" chechens following tapa chermoev, the qadiri communist-islamists under ali mitayev, the urban [Y]n bolsheviks in groznyi, and lastly the relatively insignificant naqshbandis with loyalties to islamists in [X].

 they received it both from the islamic world (with numbers of arabs streaming in), but more prominently from former soviet states and satellites, with baltic peoples, estonians, romanians, azeris, [X]is, circassians, abkhaz, georgians, poles, ukrainians, belarusians, hungarians, and even a few [Y]ns streaming in to aid the so-called "cause of freedom" that the chechen government professed.

 headed by shamil basayev and amir khattab (who were opposed vehemently by the government in grozny, from which they had broken off allegiance), the insurgents fought [Y]n forces in [X] for a week before being driven back into chechnya proper.

according to a 2000 decree of the government of [Y]n federation, [X] was supposed to compile their own list of small-numbered indigenous peoples, to be included in the overall list of small-numbered indigenous peoples of [Y]  the peoples below fall under the criteria of the decree, but were not included into the list in 2000.

 he declared a defensive jihad against [Y] and gained the support of chechens, [X]ians, and to some extent, circassians.

 he was born in the small village (aul) of gimry, (in present-day [X], [Y]).

while [Y] had managed to conquer chechnya and [X] in a series of bloody conquest, [Y]ns had developed a great respect for shamil.

 in [X], [Y] in 2010 a 17-year-old widow of a caucasus militant wearing a suicide bomb vest approached a ministry of the interior office in the village of gubden.

 prior to the forced cession of iran's caucasian territories—comprising what is now georgia, southern [X], azerbaijan, and armenia—to imperial [Y] following the two russo-persian wars of the first half of the 19th century, tabriz, being strategically located, was instrumental to the implementation of iranian rule in its caucasian territories.

although not necessarily alleging attacks against civilians, the [Y]n fsb (federal security service) accused al-haramain (among other charities) of operating for years in chechnya (see arab mujahideen in chechnya) and [X], financing wahhabi based training for emigrant would-be jihadists.

both his father, roman (revaz) bagrationi (1778 — tiflis, 1834), and uncle, pyotr bagration (kizlar, [X], 1765 — battle of borodino, 1812), were famous [Y]n army generals.

on 7 august 1999, an islamist group, led by shamil basayev and ibn al-khattab, invaded the [Y]n republic of [X].

 according to him, the attacks were a retaliation to the deaths of muslim women and children during [Y]n air raids in [X].

 according to basayev, the bombings were a retribution for the military operation of the [Y]n army against "three small villages" in [X].

 magomed salikhov (an ethnic avar) and native of [X], arrested in azerbaijan in november 2004, extradited to [Y], found not guilty on the charge of terrorism by the jury on 24 january 2006; found guilty of participating in an armed force and illegal crossing of the national border, he was retried again on the same charges on 13 november 2006 and again found not guilty, this time on all charges, including the ones he was found guilty of in the first trial.

 also it would explain basayev's reference to responsibility of [X]is and it would be consistent with the initial vow of khattab to set off the bombs blasting through [Y]n cities.

 regarding the apartment bombings, pankratov argued that the [Y]n authorities did not need an additional justification to wage a war against chechnya, in view of high-profile kidnappings and the invasion of [X].

in august–september 1999, yandarbiyev was assumed as a key figure behind the invasion by the islamic international brigade-led coalition of islamist guerrillas on the neighboring [Y]n republic of [X].

 as part of the [Y]n federation, the northern caucasus region is included in the north caucasian and southern federal districts and consists of krasnodar krai, stavropol krai, and the constituent republics, approximately from west to east: the republic of adygea, karachay-cherkessia, kabardino-balkaria, north ossetia–alania, ingushetia, chechnya, republic of [X], and to the north: kalmykia.

kumyks comprise 14% of the population of the republic of [X], the third-largest population of chechnya, and the fifth-largest population of north ossetia, all of which are parts of the [Y]n federation.

in various [Y]n, european, ottoman and persian sources kumyks were also called [X] tatars, circassian and caucasus tatars.

 in 1594, the other campaign of khvorostinin in [X] was organised, during which [Y]n forces and terek cossacks seized tarki again, but were blocked by the kumyk forces and forced to retreat to terki, which resulted in a stampede.

  according to an 1891 survey , 108,800 kumyks lived in the [X] and terek oblasts of the [Y]n empire.

due to the continuous resettlement policies by the [Y]n empire, then the soviet government, and continuing today in the modern republic of [X] of the [Y]n federation, during the 19-21st centuries the native territories of kumyks have been dramatically reduced; kumyks became a minority in their own lands.

derbent (; ; ; ); , formerly romanized as derbend, is a city in [X],  [Y], located on the caspian sea.

 it is the southernmost city in [Y], and it is the second-most important city of [X].

derbent stayed under iranian rule, while occasionally briefly taken by the ottoman turks such as in 1583 after the battle of torches and the treaty of constantinople, till the course of the 19th century, when the [Y]ns occupied the city and wider iranian-ruled swaths of [X].

as a consequence of the russo-persian war (1804-1813) and the resulting treaty of gulistan of 1813, derbent and wider [X] were ceded by qajar iran to the [Y]n empire.

in the 1886 census of [X] oblast, as part of [Y]'s caucasus viceroyalty, people of iranian descent () were still an absolute majority at 8,994 out of 15,265, or 58,9%.

lezgins (,  lezgijar) are a northeast caucasian ethnic group native predominantly to southern [X], a republic of [Y], and northeastern azerbaijan.

prior to the [Y]n revolution, "lezgin" was a term applied to all ethnic groups inhabiting the present-day [Y]n republic of [X].

in 1813, as a result of the treaty of gulistan, the [Y]ns gained control over southern [X] and most of what is the contemporary azerbaijan republic.

 the 1828 treaty of turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated [Y]n control over [X] and other area's where the lezgins lived and removed iran from the military equation.

 many lezgins in [X], however, participated in the great caucasian war that started roughly during the same time the russo-persian wars of the 19th century were happening, and fought against the [Y]ns alongside the avar imam shamil, who for 25 years (1834–1859) defied [Y]n rule.

 it was not until after his defeat in 1859 that the [Y]ns consolidated their rule over [X] and the lezgins.

lezgins live mainly in azerbaijan and [Y] ([X]).

 security forces across the border in [X] in [Y], responded skeptically to these reports.

 this may be one contributory factor to renewed calls from within the sadval movement in january 2006 for a redrawing of the [Y]n-azerbaijani border to incorporate lezgin-populated areas of southern [X] within azerbaijan.

the avars (, , "avars" or , , "mountaineers") are a northeast caucasian  ethnic group which forms the largest of several ethnic groups living in the [Y]n republic of [X].

two years after umma khan's death in 1801, the khanate voluntarily submitted to [Y]n authority following the [Y]n annexation of georgia and the treaty of georgievsk, but this was only confirmed after considerable [Y]n successes and the victory in the russo-persian war of 1804–1813, after which persia lost southern [X] and many of the rest of its caucasus territories to [Y].

 the 1828 treaty of turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated [Y]n control over [X] and other areas where the avars lived and removed iran from the military equation.

the [Y]ns' institution of heavy taxation, coupled with the expropriation of estates and the construction of fortresses, aroused the avar population into rising under the aegis of the muslim imamate of [X], led by ghazi mohammed (1828–1832), gamzat-bek (1832–1834) and shamil (1834–1859).

 there are also significant chechen populations in other subdivisions of [Y], especially in aukh (part of modern-day [X]), ingushetia and moscow.

 chechen resistance to [Y]n rule reached its peak under the leadership of the [X]i leader imam shamil.

however, this relationship is not a close one: the nakho-[X]i family is of comparable or greater time-depth than indo-european, meaning chechens are only as linguistically related to avars or dargins as the french are to the [Y]ns or iranians.

 [Y]n conquest of chechnya and [X]

 using this lawlessness extremists invaded neighboring [X] and bombed various apartment blocks in [Y], resulted in putin sending troops into chechnya again on 1 october 1999.

in 1806 the khanate voluntarily submitted to [Y]n authority, but it was not until the aftermath of the russo-persian war (1804-1813) that [Y]n power over [X] was confirmed, and that qajar persia officially ceded the territory to [Y].

 in 1813, following [Y]'s victory in the war, persia was forced to cede southern [X] with its principal city of derbent, alongside other vast territories in the caucasus to [Y], conforming with the treaty of gulistan.

 the 1828 treaty of turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated [Y]n control over [X] and removed persia from the military equation.

[X] and chechnya profited from the russo-turkish war (1877–78), to rise together against imperial [Y].

on 21 december 1917, ingushetia, chechnya, [X] and the rest of the north caucasus declared independence from [Y] and formed a single state called the "united mountain dwellers of the north caucasus" (also known as the mountainous republic of the northern caucasus) which was recognized by major world powers.

 his reign saw the irrevocable ceding of iran's northern territories in the caucasus, comprising what is nowadays georgia, [X], azerbaijan, and armenia, to the [Y]n empire following the russo-persian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 and the resulting treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay.

 by this treaty, iran had lost all of its caucasian territories comprising all of transcaucasia and [X] to neighboring imperial [Y].

after the [Y]n armies officially liberated allied georgia from persian occupation earlier in 1801, making persia officially lose control over georgia which it had been ruling for centuries, alexander fought the russo-persian war (1804–1813), the first full-scale war against neighbouring persia starting in 1804, over control and consolidation over georgia, but also eventually azerbaijan, [X] and the entire caucasus in general, which was for large swaths of it an integral territory of persia.

 after nine years of battle, [Y] managed to bring the war to an end on highly favourable terms, completing [Y]n consolidation and suzerainty over major parts of the caucasus including the gains of [X], georgia, most of azerbaijan and other regions and territories in the caucasus over persia.

 [Y]n troops first moved to gain control of the caucasus region, where the revolts of muslim tribesmen—chechens, circassians, and [X]is—had continued despite numerous [Y]n campaigns in the nineteenth century.

 azerbaijani is also spoken natively in [Y] (especially [X]), georgia and turkey.

with qajar iran being forced to cede to imperial [Y] its caucasian territories north of the aras river (that is, modern-day georgia, [X], armenia, and the republic of azerbaijan) during the course of the 19th century, through the treaties of gulistan (1813) and turkmenchay (1828), vast amounts of soil were irrevocably lost.

 the reassertion of iranian hegemony over georgia did not last long; in 1799 the [Y]ns marched into tbilisi, which would mark the beginning of the end of the iranian-ruled domains in the caucasus, comprising modern-day georgia, armenia, the republic of azerbaijan, and [X] thanks to the 19th century russo-persian wars.

 by the end of the war in 1813 and the resulting treaty of gulistan, qajar iran was forced to cede georgia, most of the modern-day republic of azerbaijan, and [X] to [Y].

the area to the north of the river aras, which included the territory of the contemporary republic of azerbaijan, eastern georgia, [X], and armenia, were iranian territory until they were occupied by [Y] during the 19th century.

the treaty confirmed the ceding and inclusion of what is now [X], eastern georgia, most of the republic of azerbaijan and parts of northern armenia from iran into the [Y]n empire.

 the area north of the aras river, including the territory of the contemporary nations of georgia, azerbaijan, armenia and the north caucasian republic of [X], were part of iran until they were occupied by [Y] during the 19th century.

as a further direct result and consequence of the treaty of gulistan in combination with the 1828 treaty turkmenchay, the formerly iranian territories came under the [Y]n, and later the soviet control for approximately 180 years, and [X] remains a constituent republic within the [Y]n federation to this day.
