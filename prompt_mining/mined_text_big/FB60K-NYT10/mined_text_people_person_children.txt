 rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

” more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

rendsburg argued that the empire of [X] and [Y] provided the setting for the statement in  that god gave to abraham and his descendants “this land, from the river of egypt to the great river, the euphrates.

” rendsburg reasoned that this passage makes sense only in the period of [X] and [Y], as before [X] and [Y], it would have been unimaginable for an author to use these boundaries to define the land of israel, and after [X] and [Y], israel once more became a small state and those boundaries were an impossibility.

 rendsburg cited this as further support for his conclusion that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 rendsburg argued that the only time that an author would considered this necessary would be in the time of [X] and [Y], as before then, there were no kings (except for the transitional saul), and after then, kingship was a fait accompli.

 arguing that the only time that an author would need to justify kingship was when it was the new creation of israelite political theorists, rendsburg cited these verses as further evidence that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 the sifre cited as examples of admonition near death: (1) when abraham reproved abimelech in , (2) when isaac reproved abimelech, ahuzzath, and phicol in , (3) when joshua admonished the israelites in , (4) when samuel admonished the israelites in , and (5) when [X] admonished [Y] in .

 rendsburg explained genesis's interest with this motif by recalling that [X] was the youngest of jesse’s seven sons (see ), and [Y] was among the youngest, if not the youngest, of [X]’s sons (see ).

 the two remaining candidates were adonijah ([X]’s fourth son) and [Y], and although adonijah was older (and once claimed the throne when [X] was old and feeble in ), [Y] won out.

 an israelite could thus not criticize [X]’s selection of [Y] to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — isaac, jacob, judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

 more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

the book of jubilees presents itself as "the history of the division of the days of the law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world" and claims to be a revelation of god to moses, given through the angel of the presence in addition to the written law received by moses on mount sinai; and, while the written law was to be imparted to all, this was to be a secret tradition entrusted only to the saints of each generation, to enoch, methuselah, noah, and shem, then to [X], [Y], jacob, and levi, and finally to the priests and scribes of the latter times.

genesis relates the binding of [Y], by [X] to present his son, [Y], as a sacrifice on mount moriah.

 the story ends with an angel stopping [X] at the last minute and making [Y]'s sacrifice unnecessary by providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead.

 francesca stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story "contains traces of a tradition in which [X] does sacrifice [Y]".

 kook, first chief rabbi of israel, stressed that the climax of the story, commanding [X] not to sacrifice [Y], is the whole point: to put an end to the ritual of child sacrifice, which contradicts the morality of a perfect and giving (not taking) monotheistic god.

i revealed myself to [X], to [Y], and to jacob as Ēl shaddāi, but was not known to them by my name, yhvh.

together with other young men, among them the poet heinrich heine, zunz founded the verein für kultur und wissenschaft der juden (the society for the culture and science of the jews) alongside joel [X] list, [Y] marcus jost, and eduard gans in berlin in 1819.

 we should not misconstrue paul's stress on [X]'s faith in his view of gn 15:6 to say that [X] performed no works of loving obedience to god at this time or prior, nor should we misconstrue james's view of works in genesis 22 to say that [X]'s attempted sacrifice of [Y] was not a supreme act of faith.

 the second canticle was written in 1952, between billy budd and gloriana, on the theme of [X]'s obedience to divine authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son [Y].

 the "land of moriah" (, ʾeretṣ ha-môriyyāh) is the name given by genesis to the location of [X]'s binding of [Y].

 according to the torah in , [Y] is brought rebekah to marry by his father [X]'s servant, and rebekah took her veil and covered herself when [Y] was approaching.

 to justify this view, it references a passage of the quran, which mentions that the sons of yaʿqūb (jacob) referred to his uncle ismāʿīl (ishmael), father is-ḥāq ([Y]) and grandfather ibrāhīm ([X]) as his ābāʾ ():

 according to very old traditions, [X], [Y] and rebekah, jacob and leah were also buried there ().

 for not all who are descended from israel belong to israel, and not all are children of [X] because they are his offspring, but "through [Y] shall your offspring be named.

moriah  (hebrew: , modern: mōrīyya, samaritan: moreh; arabic: ﻣﺮﻭﻩ, marwah) is the name given to a mountainous region in the book of genesis, where the binding of [Y] by [X] is said to have taken place.

 there has been a historical account of rams' horns preserved in the kaaba until the year 683, which are believed to be the remains of the sacrifice of ishmael - the first son of [X], who most muslims believe was the son [X] tied down and almost sacrificed, and not [Y].

 this has led to the classical rabbinical supposition that the moriah region mentioned in genesis as the place where [X] almost sacrificed [Y] was in jerusalem.

 on the other hand, some interpretations of a biblical passage concerning melchizedek, king of salem, would indicate jerusalem was already a city with a priest at the time of [X], and thus is unlikely to have been founded on the lonely spot where [X] tried to sacrifice [Y].

israelites are defined as the descendants of jacob, son of [Y], grandson of [X].

 according to the [X]ic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by [X] as a burial plot, although most historians believe the [X]-[Y]-jacob narrative to be primarily mythological.

the tractate continues by discussing another hypothesis, that the name stems from it being the tomb of the three couples, [X] and sarah, [Y] and rebecca, jacob and leah, considered to be the patriarchs and matriarchs of the [X]ic religions:

 rabbi yitzḥak said: the city is called kiryat ha'arba, the city of four, because it is the city of the four couples buried there: adam and eve, [X] and sarah, [Y] and rebecca, and jacob and leah.

the next burial in the cave is that of [X] himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons [Y] and ishmael.

 the mamluks also built the northwestern staircase and the six cenotaphs (for [Y], rebecca, jacob, leah, [X], and sarah, respectively), distributed evenly throughout the enclosure.

the teachings of the torah and tanakh reveal the israelites's familiarity with human sacrifices, as exemplified by the near-sacrifice of [Y] by his father [X] (genesis 22:1-24) and some believe, the actual sacrifice of jephthah's daughter (judges 11:31-40), while many believe that jephthah's daughter was committed for life in service equivalent to a nunnery of the day, as indicated by her lament over her "weep for my virginity" and never having known a man (v37).

 some see the story of [X] and [Y] (genesis 22) as an example of an etiological myth, explaining the abolition of human sacrifice.

after the loss in charleston, the defeats of general [Y] huger at the battle of monck's corner and lieutenant colonel [X] buford at the battle of waxhaws (near the north carolina border, in what is now lancaster county), marion organized a small unit, which at first consisted of between 20 and 70 men and was the only force then opposing the british army in the state.

 in some institutions, classical jewish philosophy or kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [X] [Y] kook).

 hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [X] [Y] kook, "rav kook", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy (as well as to torat eretz yisrael generally).

 the more recent ein ayah is a separate four-volume work by rabbi [X] [Y] kook, begun in 1883.

 "notes on stravinsky's [X] and [Y]".

according to [X] [Y] kook, the leviathan – a singular creature with no mate, "its tail is placed in its mouth" (zohar) "twisting around and encompassing the entire world" (rashi on baba batra 74b) – projects a vivid metaphor for the universe's underlying unity.

 this cultural milieu was conducive to miraculous birth stories – they were common in biblical tradition going back to [X] and sarah (and the conception of [Y]).

 during two days of testimony, wertham explained fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of [X] and [Y] (genesis 22:1–24).

 noah held this priesthood, as did [X], [Y], and jacob.

 in the biblical narrative, god tells [X] to sacrifice his son, [Y], on moriah.

according to the hebrew bible, god commands [X] to offer his son [Y] as a sacrifice.

 after [Y] is bound to an altar, a messenger from god  stops [X] before the sacrifice finishes, saying "now i know you fear god.

"  [X] looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of [Y].

in the binding of [Y], religious murders & kabbalah, lippman bodoff argues that [X] never intended to actually sacrifice his son, and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so.

 first, [X]'s willingness to sacrifice [Y] demonstrates the limit of humanity's capability to both love and fear god.

in legends of the jews, rabbi louis ginzberg argues that the binding of [Y] is a way for god to test [Y]'s claim to ishmael, and to silence satan's protest about [X] who had not brought up any offering to god after [Y] was born, also to show a proof to the world that [X] is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of god's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:

the binding of [Y] is mentioned in the new testament epistle to the hebrews among many acts of faith recorded in the old testament: "by faith [X], when he was tested, offered up [Y], and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, 'in [Y] your seed shall be called,' concluding that god was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.

[X]'s faith in god is such that he felt god would be able to resurrect the slain [Y], in order that his prophecy (genesis 21:12) might be fulfilled.

 this interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as [X] sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey (genesis 22:4), or [X] taking the wood and putting it on his son [Y]'s shoulder (genesis 22:6).

 another thing to note is how god reemphasizes [Y] being [X]'s one and only son whom he loves (genesis 22:2,12,16).

  as further support that the binding of [Y] foretells the gospel of jesus christ, when the two went up there, [Y] asked [X] "where is the lamb for the burnt offering" to which [X] responded "god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.

 the next two verses state god also granted [X] the righteous son [Y] and promised more rewards.

 one side of the argument believed it was [Y] rather than ishmael (notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari) interpreting the verse "god's perfecting his mercy on [X] and [Y]" as referring to his making [X] his closest one, and to his rescuing [Y].

 11–12), in which the angel of yhwh stops [X] before he kills [Y].

 this analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the binding and the story of sodom (), in which [X] protests against god's unethical plan to destroy the city, without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked: far be it from you to do such a thing: shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?" [X]'s ethical rebellion against god in the destruction of sodom culminates in his disobedience to god, refusing to sacrifice [Y].

francesca stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story "contains traces of a tradition in which [X] does sacrifice [Y]".

 friedman argued that in the original e story, [X] may have carried out the sacrifice of [Y], but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of je to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for [Y].

some scholars also point at the genealogical snippet (verses 20–24) as containing a hint to the question whether [X] sacrificed [Y] or not.

jephthah's sacrifice of his daughter stands in stark contrast to the binding of [Y] in the book of genesis, in which [X] was about to perform a divinely ordered sacrifice of his son, when an angel of god directly intervened and stopped the sacrifice.

however, in the hebrew bible, the same word for 'burnt offering' (hebrew, ʿōlāh) used in reference to jepthah and his daughter in judges 11:31 is also used in other biblical stories alluding to human sacrifice, such as the story of [X] and [Y] (genesis 22) and mesha of moab and his son (2 kings 3:27).

in its highly interpolated account of god's testing of [X] concerning [Y], it says in 23:50-51: "and when they were going along [Y] said to his father: behold, i see here the fire and wood, and where then is the lamb that is to be the burnt offering before the lord? and [X] answered his son [Y], saying: the lord has made choice of thee my son, to be a perfect burnt offering instead of the lamb.

 soloveitchik and the closely related torah umadda, as well as by the writings of rabbi [X] [Y] kook.

modern orthodoxy draws on the teachings of rabbi [X] [Y] kook (1864–1935), as well as the writings and interpretations of his son rabbi zvi yehuda kook (1891–1982), both as regards their views on jewish peoplehood and as they regard the (related) interaction with the secular world.

 [X], [Y], jacob and other faithful patriarchs would be resurrected to perfect human life and be made princes and rulers, the visible representatives of the new order on earth.

 muslims believe that gabriel was the angel who informed zachariah (zakariyyā) of john's birth, as well as mary (maryam) of the future nativity of jesus; and that gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed [X] (ʾibrāhīm) of the birth of [Y] (ʾisḥāq) [].

 muslims maintain that [X] further asked god to bless both the lines of his progeny, of isma'il and isḥaq ([Y]), and to keep all of his descendants in the protection of god.

 [X] had two children, ishmael and [Y], who both later became prophets.

 known to muslims as the sanctuary of [X] it is also thought to be the burial site of his son [Y], his wife rebecca, their son jacob, and his wife leah.

 other verses mention the near-sacrifice of [X]'s son, whose name is not given but is presumed to be ishmael as the following verses mention the birth of [Y].

 the quran also repeatedly establishes [X]'s role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including [Y], jacob and ishmael.

during his stay in palestine, hutner became a disciple of [X] [Y] kook, the first chief rabbi of palestine, to whom he was distantly related.

 he called his outlook hilchot deot vechovot halevavot, ("laws [of] 'ideas' and 'duties [of the] heart'") and wrote in a poetic modern-style hebrew reminiscent of his original mentor [X] [Y] kook's style, even though almost all of hutner's original lectures were delivered in yiddish.

 jacob and esau were the sons of [Y] and rebecca, and the grandsons of [X] and sarah.

 as a result, jacob becomes the spiritual leader of the family after [Y]'s death and the heir of the promises of [X] ().

 additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of mary magdalene, the brome [X] and [Y] and a sixteenth-century play of the conversion of saint paul exist, all hailing from east anglia.

 most contain episodes such as the fall of lucifer, the creation and fall of man, cain and abel, noah and the flood, [X] and [Y], the nativity, the raising of lazarus, the passion, and the resurrection.

 several sources, such as yalkut shimoni (i, 110) describe him as the guardian angel of esau relating him to rome, the one who wrestled with jacob, the angel who ordered [X] to sacrifice [Y], and a patron of edom.

[X], [Y], and jacob are referred to as the three patriarchs of the people of israel, and the period during which they lived is termed the patriarchal age.

his works inspired the polish branch of hasidism, as well as a more recent wave of torah scholars originating from lithuania and latvia, most markedly rabbi eliyahu eliezer dessler (1892–1953) as well as rabbi [X] [Y] kook (1864–1935).

 mary surpassed [X] with her faith, [Y] with her patience and joseph with her chastity.

 before converting, he was a member of the society for the culture and science of the jews, alongside joel [X] list, [Y] marcus jost and leopold zunz.

bar-chayim further quotes [X] [Y] kook (1865–1935), founder of the yeshiva and the first ashkenazi chief rabbi of british mandatory palestine:

 its beliefs were based heavily on the teachings of rabbi [X] [Y] kook and his son, zvi yehuda kook, who taught that secular zionists, through their conquests of eretz israel, had unwittingly brought about the beginning of the messianic age, which would culminate in the coming of the messiah, which gush emunim supporters believe can be hastened through jewish settlement on land they believe god has allotted to the jewish people as set forth in the hebrew bible.

 jesus subsequently defends his belief in resurrection against sadducaic resistance, stating, "and as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of moses, in the story about the bush, how god said to him "i am the god of [X], the god of [Y], and the god of jacob?" he is god not of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong.

 that the only surviving member of the group of three, [Y], was being sent back with the elephant was heralded as advance news to charlemagne from two emissaries he met in 801: one was sent by the caliph harun al-rashid himself, another by [X] (ibrahim ibn al-aghlab), who was governor of africa.

 elaborating on this theme are numerous early and late jewish scholars, including the ramban, [Y] abrabanel, [X] ibn ezra, rabbeinu bachya, the vilna gaon, the lubavitcher rebbe, the ramchal, aryeh kaplan, and rebbetzin esther jungreis.

  most jewish and christian authors view the binding of [Y] (genesis 22), in which [X] was called by god to offer his son [Y] as a burnt offering, as a test of [X]'s loyalty.

[X] [Y] kook (1864–1935), rabbi, thinker, diplomat, mediator, scholar

rabbi [X] [Y] kook wrote an alternative anthem titled "haemunah" ("the faith") which he proposed as a replacement for "hatikvah".

christian identity (also known as identity christianity) is an interpretation of christianity which advocates the belief that only celtic and germanic peoples, such as the anglo-saxon, nordic nations, and/or aryan people and people of kindred blood are the descendants of [X], [Y], and jacob and are therefore the descendants of the ancient israelites.

christian identity adherents assert that the white people of europe in particular or caucasians in general are god's servant people, according to the promises that were given to [X], [Y], and jacob.

 while different [X]ic faiths portray her differently, judaism, christianity, and islam all depict her character similarly, as that of a pious woman, renowned for her hospitality and beauty, the wife and half-sister of [X], and the mother of [Y].

  by her union with [X], she had one child, [Y].

" [X] held a great feast on the day when [Y] was to be weaned.

sometime after the birth of ishmael but before the birth of [Y], sarah and [X] travel to gerar, as described in genesis 20, where events took place which mirrored those of mizraim, in which a king, this time abimelech, took an interest in sarah for her beauty and, as he had done in mizraim, [X] presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so, believing her unmarried abimelech took her into her house as pharaoh had though, this time, yahweh intervened before he touched sarah, through dreams and plague.

 [X] thereupon invited all the notabilities to a banquet on the day when [Y] was to be weaned.

 [X] and [Y] returned to their home at beer-sheba, and, not finding sarah there, went to hebron, where they discovered her dead.

the islamic portrayal of sarah, who is unnamed in the quran, mimics that of her portrayal in judaism and christianity, in that she is a good woman, kin and wife to [X], who, after years of barrenness, is blessed with a son, the prophet [Y] (isḥāq).

 the compound, located in the ancient city of hebron, is the second holiest site for jews (after the temple mount in jerusalem), and is also venerated by christians and muslims, both of whom have traditions which maintain that the site is the burial place of three biblical couples; [X] and sarah, [Y] and rebecca, and jacob and leah.

there are three stories in genesis where a patriarch identifies his wife as his sister; scholars debate the relationship among these, with some saying that the account of the encounter of [X] and sarah with pharaoh in genesis 12-13 is the oldest, while the stories of [X] and sarah encounter king abimelech in genesis 20, and of [Y] and rebecca's encounter with a different king abimelech in genesis 26, are interpretations of that one, generated to explain it or deal with other matters of concern.

according to emanuel feldman (1965), basing his argument on albright's interpretation of the archaeology of nuzu, a wife could legally be awarded the title "sister", and that this was the most sacred form of marriage, and hence [X] and [Y] referred to their wives as "sisters" for this reason.

 [X]'s second son [Y] is called father of the hebrews.

 in the hadith, muhammad says that some twenty five thousand prophets and messengers came from [X]'s seed, most of these being from [Y], and that the last one in this line was jesus.

the qur'an speaks extensively about the children of israel (banû isrâ'îl) and recognizes that the jews (al-yahûd) are, according to lineage, descendants of prophet [X] through his son [Y] and grandson jacob.

saunderson possessed the friendship of leading mathematicians of the time: [Y] newton, edmond halley, [X] de moivre and roger cotes.

 the patriarchs: the story of [X], [Y] and jacob (1959)

 he took certain statements, for example, by the ashkenazi chief rabbi of palestine, [X] [Y] kook regarding the eventual return in time of the temple mount back to jewish hands, and turned them to a concrete political plot to seize control of the area.

the three patriarchs: [X], [Y] and jacob

 first come the biographies of the men who antedated the several written laws of the torah, as enos, enoch, noah, [X], [Y], and jacob.

 as in judaism and christianity, islam maintains that [Y] was the son of the patriarch and prophet [X] from his wife sarah.

 muslims hold [Y] in deep veneration because they believe that both [Y] and his older half-brother ishmael continued their father's spiritual legacy through their subsequent preaching of the message of god after the death of [X].

 [Y] was the age of 10 when his half-brother ishmael went out from [X]’s house into the desert.

 the quran states that [X] received "good tidings of [Y], a prophet, of the righteous", and that god blessed them both (37: 112).

 and among their progeny are the virtuous and those who clearly wrong themselves"  in a fuller description, when angels came to ibrahim to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on sodom and gomorrah, his wife, sarah, "laughed, and we gave her good tidings of [Y], and after [Y] of (a grandson) jacob" (11: 71-74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite [X] and sarah's old age.

 several verses speak of [Y] as a "gift" to [X] (6: 84; 19: 49-50), and 29: 26-27 adds that god made "prophethood and the book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to [X]'s two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson joseph.

 in the quran, it later narrates that [X] also praised god for giving him ishmael and [Y] in his old age (xiv: 39-41).

elsewhere in the quran, [Y] is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers [X], [Y] and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); yaʿqūb's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "[X], ishmael and [Y]", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "[X], ishmael, [Y], jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; iii: 84).

 alongside [Y]'s tomb are those of some of the other qur'anic/biblical patriarchs and their wives: [X] and sarah and jacob and leah.

 in genesis 22, the binding of [Y] foretells the gospel of jesus christ, when [Y] asked his father [X] "where is the lamb for the burnt offering" to which [X] responded "god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.

 avot ("ancestors") - praises of god as the god of the biblical patriarchs, "god of [X], god of [Y] and god of jacob.

reform judaism has changed the first benediction, traditionally invoking the phrase "god of our fathers, god of [X], god of [Y] and god of jacob," one of the biblical names of god.

 new editions of the reform siddur explicitly say avoteinu v'imoteinu "our fathers and our mothers", and reform and some conservative congregations amend the second invocation to "god of [X], god of [Y] and god of jacob; god of sarah, god of rebekah, god of leah, and god of rachel.

 its column in the square in front of the building with statue of [X] and [Y] was built in 1722.

at the time of the covenant, god informed [X] that his wife sarah would give birth to a son, whom he was instructed to name [Y].

 god told [X] that he would establish his covenant through [Y], and when [X] inquired as to ishmael's role, god answered that ishmael has been blessed and that he "will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and i will make him a great nation.

a year later, ishmael's half-brother [Y] was born to [X] by his first wife sarah when she was 90 years old (), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ().

on the day of feasting during which [X] celebrated the weaning of [Y], ishmael was "mocking" or "playing with" [Y] (the hebrew word ,  is ambiguous) and sarah asked [X] to expel ishmael and his mother, saying: "get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son [Y].

 [X] agreed only after god told him that "in [Y] your seed shall be called", and that god would "make a nation of the son of the bondwoman" ishmael, since he was a descendant of [X] (), god having previously told [X] "i will establish my covenant with [[Y]]", while also making promises concerning the ishmaelite nation ().

 the lord's covenant made clear ishmael was not to inherit [X]'s house and that [Y] would be the seed of the covenant: "take your son, your only son, whom you love and go to the region of moriah.

ishmael appeared with [Y] at the burial of [X].

 according to the book of genesis, in the hebrew bible, [Y] rather than ishmael was the true heir of the [X]ic tradition and covenant, while at the same time being blessed by god with a great nation.

 in other chapters of the quran, however, which date from the medina period, ishmael is mentioned closely with his father [X]: ishmael stands alongside [X] in their attempt to set up the kaaba in mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage and [X] thanks god for granting him ishmael and [Y] in his old age.

 ishmael is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations and jacob's sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, "[X], ishmael and [Y]", when testifying their faith.

 in the quranic narrative of the near-sacrifice of [X]'s son, the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was ishmael, tabari maintained that it was [Y], consistent with the hebrew scriptures.

the scriptures of the baháʼí faith state that it was ishmael, and not [Y], who was the son [X] almost sacrificed.

 from this vantage point atop a ridge overlooking jerusalem's old city and the dead sea, tradition holds that [X] was shown mount moriah as the site for the binding of [Y] as recorded in the bible.

kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in [X] when "god tested [him] and said to him, take [Y], your only son, whom you love, and go to the land of moriah and offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain that i shall show you.

 [X] becomes kierkegaard and [Y] becomes regine in this interpretation.

) the ethical expression of what [X] did is that he meant to murder [Y], the religious expression is that he meant to sacrifice [Y] – but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet, without this anxiety [X] is not who he is.

 problema 3: was it ethically defensible for [X] to conceal his undertaking from sarah, from eliezer, and from [Y]?

he says of [X], "if the task had been different, if the lord had commanded [X] to bring [Y] up to mount moriah so that he could have his lightning strike [Y] and take him as a sacrifice in that way, then [X] plainly would have been justified in speaking as enigmatically as he did, for then he himself could not have known what was going to happen.

 but given the task as assigned to [X], he himself has to act; consequently, he has to know in the crucial moment what he himself will do, and consequently, he has to know that [Y] is going to be sacrificed.

 it begins with a paraphrase repeated four times, on the story of [X]'s journey to mount moriah to offer [Y].

beersheba is mainly dealt with in the hebrew bible in connection with the patriarchs [X] and [Y], who both dig a well and close peace treaties with king abimelech of gerar at the site.

 hence it receives its name twice, first after [X]'s dealings with abimelech (), and again from [Y] who closes his own covenant with abimelech of gerar and whose servants also dig a well there ().

 according to the hebrew bible, the wells were dug by [X] and [Y] when they arrived there.

jacob had twelve sons through four women, his wives, [X] and rachel, and his concubines, bilhah and zilpah, who were, in order of their birth, reuben, simeon, levi, judah, dan, naphtali, gad, asher, issachar, zebulun, joseph, and benjamin, all of whom became the heads of their own family groups, later known as the twelve tribes of israel, and he also had one daughter, [Y].

 afterwards, [X] became fertile again and gave birth to issachar, zebulun, and [Y], jacob's first and only daughter.

judah is the fourth son of the patriarch jacob and his first wife, [X]: his full brothers are reuben, simeon and levi (all older), and issachar and zebulun (younger), gad and asher (younger) by [X]'s handmaid, and one full sister [Y].

 [X] gives birth to two more sons after this, issachar and zebulun, and to jacob's only daughter, [Y].

 earlier passages in the book of genesis give some background on her father's family, noting that through him, she is the niece of rebecca, who is the wife of isaac and the mother of jacob and esau, and the granddaughter of bethuel, and rabbinic literature goes even further, with the book of jasher claiming [X] and rachel were twins and recording her mother's name as a[Y] and her brothers' names as beor, alub, and murash.

 rabbinical literature contradicts itself on whether or not [X] and rachel were half-siblings to zilpah and bilhah, two sisters who would serve as mistresses to [X]'s future husband, jacob, and whose children she and rachel would raise as their own, as one source lists them as being daughters of laban, but not his wife a[Y], and another lists them as being the daughters of rotheus, a man who was close to laban but not related to him.

 [X]'s (and rachel's) parents were laban and a[Y] .

[X] is the mother of six of jacob's sons, including his first four (reuben, simeon, levi, and judah), and later two more (issachar and zebulun), and a daughter ([Y]).

 biblical scholars have instead simply proposed that the discrepancy in the enumeration of [X]'s children is due to the list not originally having included [Y], who was added by a later editor to introduce consistency with the story of the rape of [Y].

in the book of genesis, [Y] (; ) was the seventh child and daughter of jacob and [X] (jacob's eleventh child and only daughter), and one of the patriarchs of the israelites.

[Y] is first mentioned in genesis 30:21 as the daughter of [X] and jacob, born to [X] after she bore six sons to jacob.

so the men of shechem were deceived, and were circumcised; and "on the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of jacob and [X], simeon and levi, [Y]'s brothers, took their swords and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males.

 [Y] is specifically listed, in verse 15 ("these are the sons of [X], that she bore to jacob in padan aram, and [Y] his daughter.

one midrash states that [Y] was conceived as a male in [X]'s womb but miraculously changed to a female, lest the maid-servants (bilhah and zilpah) be associated with more of the israelite tribes than rachel.

 laban's wife and the mother of [X] and rachel was a[Y].

 reuben, appearing without a birth narrative, is then described as bringing mandrakes to his mother [X], who then gives birth to issachar, zebulun, and [Y].

[Y], daughter of jacob and [X], who when violated by shechem, her brothers slayed the people of shechem in an act of revenge

 and afterwards [X] bore a daughter, and called her name [Y].

 and rav taught that the word "afterward" in  signified that [X] bore [Y] "after" she passed judgment on herself, reasoning that twelve tribes were destined to issue from jacob and six had already issued from her and four from the handmaids, and if the child of the current pregnancy were to be a boy, then rachel would not have as many sons as one of the handmaids.

rabbi zadok noted that  attributed sons to [X] but attributed the daughter [Y] to jacob, and deduced that the verse thus supported the proposition that if the woman emits her egg first she will bear a son and if the man emits his semen first she will bear a girl.

 it is a first-person narrative that tells the story of [Y], daughter of jacob and [X], sister of joseph.

[Y] opens the story by recounting for readers the union of her mother [X] and father jacob, as well as the expansion of the family to include [X]'s sister rachel, and the handmaids zilpah and bilhah.

the three steles (or tablets) of [Y] are in essence, three hymns written in adoration for the more abstract being, barbelo, from the perspective of the archetype of [Y] (“emmakha [Y]”) and his father [X] (or “ger[X]as”).

 the steles themselves were allegedly written by emmakha [Y], a spiritual archetype of [Y], the son of [X] and eve and founder of the gnostic race (immovable race, seed of [Y]), and thus are considered pseudepigraphic.

 the famous historian of first century, josephus mentions in his antiquities, a story where [Y], son of [X], leaves some stone tablets inscribed with esoteric information for his future offspring high in the mountains.

stele one assumes the voice of [Y], and then of [Y] together with ger[X]as praising their respective creators.

hymn 1: [Y]'s hymn to piger[X]as (the divine [X]) and autogenes (the self-generated)

emmakha [Y]’s praise of the ger[X]as is, as the title indicates a hymn dedicating to the glorifying of [Y]’s father, ger[X]as, better known as [X]as, or [X].

 the hymn is from the perspective of emmakha [Y], his spiritual archetype, and when he refers to ger[X]as he is likewise referring to [X]’s spiritual archetype which resides in the lowest realm within barbelo.

 he praises ger[X]s for creating him ([Y]) and praises “god” for creating ger[X]as.

 the actual lineage the author is likely referring to is that [X], was derived from barbelo, who resides over [X], [Y], and the rest of the lower realms, while barbelo itself was derived from the invisible parent.

praise of the barbelo takes on the voice of both ger[X]as and [Y] who are jointly praising barbelo since this is ultimately where they derive from and where they reside in their spiritual archetype forms.

stele 2 assumes the collective voices of [Y] and ger[X]s in praise of the barbelo.

hymn 3: praise of the barbelo begins on the second stele and continues to praise barbelo as both [Y] and ger[X]as, beginning with “masculine, virgin, first aeon…”  verse 121:20 this hymn tends to focus more on the barbelo and its prominent role being a self-reflection of the one.

 this hymn also takes on the voice of more than just [Y] and [X] (“we all praise you”)

 the silence referred to is the climax moment of contemplation in ascension, where the soul resides in the third and highest realm within barbelo, at which point the descension back to the first realm where [X] and [Y] reside begins, blessing the other realms on the way down.

 by the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham, [X] or [Y] credible historical figures.

along with [X] and [Y], he is the one whose name would appear united with god, as god in judaism was called elohei abraham, elohei yitzchaq ve elohei ya'aqob ("god of abraham, god of [X], and god of [Y]") and never the god of anyone else.

 the remaining thirty-nine chapters of genesis provide an account of god's covenant with the biblical patriarchs abraham, [X] and [Y] (also called israel) and [Y]'s children, the "children of israel", especially joseph.

 in those works, spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential god—the god of abraham, [X] and [Y]; and claims that the law was neither literally given by god nor any longer binding on jews.

 god of abraham, god of [X], god of [Y], not of the philosophers and the scholars.

 clines, in his influential the themes of the pentateuch (1978), identified the overarching theme of the five books as the partial fulfilment of a promise made by god to the patriarchs, abraham, [X] and [Y].

in jewish legend, david's sin with bathsheba is the punishment for david's excessive self-consciousness who had besought god to lead him into temptation so that he might give proof of his constancy as abraham, [X], and [Y] (who successfully passed the test) whose names later were united with god's, while david eventually failed through the temptation of a woman.

the next verse, "and i will bring you into the land which i swore to give to abraham, to [X], and to [Y]; i will give it to you for a possession.

 in mishkan t'filah, the american reform jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to god as “he” have been removed, and whenever jewish patriarchs are named (abraham, [X], and [Y]), so also are the matriarchs (sarah, rebecca, rachel, and leah.

in 1966, at the congress of median, buddhologist edward conze noted phenomenological commonalities between mahayana buddhism and gnosticism, in his paper buddhism and gnosis, following an early suggestion put forward by [X] [Y] schmidt.

 at god's command, noah's descendant abraham journeys from his birthplace (described as ur of the chaldeans and whose identification with sumerian ur is tentative in modern scholarship) into the god-given land of canaan, where he dwells as a sojourner, as does his son [X] and his grandson [Y].

 the narrative is punctuated by a series of covenants with god, successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the covenant with noah) to a special relationship with one people alone (abraham and his descendants through [X] and [Y]).

 (the stories of [X] do not make up a coherent cycle of stories and function as a bridge between the cycles of abraham and [Y].

[X]'s wife rebecca gives birth to the twins esau (meaning velvet), father of the edomites, and [Y] (meaning supplanter or follower).

the patriarchs, or ancestors, are abraham, [X] and [Y], with their wives (joseph is normally excluded).

 [Y] ben hayyim zemah wrote in his glossa on [X] luria's version of the shulchan aruch that, "one who wishes to tap the hidden wisdom, must conduct himself in the manner of the pious.

 in central poland, the new leader was [Y] [X] horowiz, the "seer of lublin", who was of a particularly populist bent and appealed to the common folk with miracle working and little strenuous spiritual demands.

 the seer's senior acolyte, [Y] [X] rabinovitz, the "holy jew" of przysucha, gradually dismissed his mentor's approach as overly vulgar, and adopted a more aesthetic and scholarly approach, virtually without theurgy to the masses.

 the following year [Y] yaple, [X] dumond, and peter hinepaw returned with their families and constructed log cabins.

 [X] favored esau, and rebekah favored [Y].

 while esau was hunting, [Y], after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that [Y] became [X]'s primary heir and esau was left in an inferior position.

 thereafter, [X] sent [Y] into mesopotamia to take a wife of his mother's brother's house.

according to local tradition, the graves of [X] and rebekah, along with the graves of abraham and sarah and [Y] and leah, are in the cave of the patriarchs.

in the epistle to the hebrews, abraham's willingness to follow god's command to sacrifice [X] is used as an example of faith as is [X]'s action in blessing [Y] and esau with reference to the future promised by god to abraham.

 among [X]'s children was the follow-up israelite patriarch [Y], who is also venerated as an islamic prophet.

[X] is mentioned seventeen times by name in the quran, often with his father and his son, [Y].

 in a fuller description, when angels came to abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on sodom and gomorrah, his wife, sarah, "laughed, and we gave her good tidings of [X], and after [X] of (a grandson) [Y]" (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite abraham and sarah's old age.

 several verses speak of [X] as a "gift" to abraham (6: 84; 14: 49–50), and 24: 26–27 adds that god made "prophethood and the book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson [Y], and his prophetic great-grandson joseph.

elsewhere in the quran, [X] is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers abraham, [X] and [Y] (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); [Y]'s sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "abraham, ishmael and [X]", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "abraham, ishmael, [X], [Y] and the patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84).

 [X] and [Y] are mentioned as being bestowed upon abraham as gifts of god, who then worshipped god only and were righteous leaders in the way of god:

according to martin noth, a scholar of the hebrew bible, the narratives of [X] date back to an older cultural stage than that of the west-jordanian [Y].

 later, the descendants of [X]'s son [Y] were enslaved in egypt, and god commanded moses to lead the exodus from egypt.

 [Y] first appears in the book of genesis, where he is described as the son of [X] and rebecca, and the grandson of abraham, sarah and bethuel.

 according to the biblical account, he was the second-born of [X]'s children, the elder being [Y]'s fraternal twin brother, esau.

[Y] and his twin brother, esau, were born to [X] and rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when [X] was 60 years of age.

 moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: "and [X] loved esau, because he did eat of his venison: but rebecca loved [Y].

 it is suggested that she realized prophetically that [X]'s blessings would go to [Y], since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger.

 rebecca blessed [Y] and she quickly ordered [Y] to bring her two kid goats from their flock so that he could take esau's place in serving [X] and receiving his blessing.

 [Y] did as his mother instructed and, when he returned with the kids, rebecca made the savory meat that [X] loved.

disguised as esau, [Y] entered [X]'s room.

 [X] demanded that [Y] come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like esau's hairy skin.

 confused, [X] exclaimed, "the voice is [Y]'s voice, but the hands are the hands of esau!" still trying to get at the truth, [X] asked him directly, "art thou my very son esau?" and [Y] answered simply, "i am.

" [X] proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that [Y] gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him.

 as [Y] kissed his father, [X] smelled the clothes which belonged to esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was esau.

 [X] then blessed [Y] with the blessing that was meant for esau.

 the realization that he had been deceived shocked [X], yet he acknowledged that [Y] had received the blessings by adding, "indeed, he will be [or remain] blessed!" (27:33).

 having made [Y] a ruler over his brothers, [X] could only promise, "by your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck" (27:39–40).

although esau sold [Y] his own birthright, which was his blessing, for "red pottage," esau still hated [Y] for receiving his blessing that their father [X] unknowingly had given to him.

 he vowed to kill [Y] as soon as [X] died.

 she convinced [X] to send [Y] away by telling him that she despaired of his marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of canaan (as esau had done).

 after [X] sent [Y] away to find a wife, esau realized his own canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes and so he took a daughter of [X]'s half-brother, ishmael, as another wife.

 [Y] actually diverted himself to succoth and was not recorded as rejoining esau until, at machpelah, the two bury their father [X], who lived to be 180, and was 60 years older than they were.

 [Y] was finally reunited with his father [X] in mamre (outside hebron).

when [X] died at the age of 180, [Y] and esau buried him in the cave of the patriarchs, which abraham had purchased as a family burial plot.

 a conservative interpretation is that, at [X]'s burial, [Y] obtained the records of esau, who had been married 80 years prior, and incorporated them into his own family records, and that moses augmented and published them.

 in that case, since [X] was 60 when [Y] and essau were born and they had been married for 20 years, then [X] was 40 years old when he married rebecca (gen.

 in either case, [X] and rebecca were married for 20 years before [Y] and esau were born.

rashi explained that [X], when blessing [Y] instead of esau, smelled the heavenly scent of gan eden (paradise) when [Y] entered his room and, in contrast, perceived gehenna opening beneath esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by esau's show of piety.

in contrast to the judeo-christian view of [Y], one main difference is that the story of [Y]'s blessing, in which he deceives [X], is not accepted in islam.

 dever wrote in 2001: "after a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham, [X], or [Y] 'historical figures.

 according to rabbi jose bar hanina, each of the patriarchs instituted one prayer: abraham the morning, [X] the afternoon and [Y] the evening prayers.

1994 – [Y] begins to assume supreme leadership of north korea upon the death of his father, [X].

 possibly to avoid referring to [X], [Y] or kim jong-un as the enemy, the second syllable of "enemy" is written and pronounced  in the north.

the ruling kim family in north korea ([X], [Y] and kim jong-un) has been described as a de facto absolute monarchy or a "hereditary dictatorship".

in 1992, as [X]'s health began deteriorating, [Y] slowly began taking over various state tasks.

 [X] died of a heart attack in 1994, with [Y] declaring a three-year period of national mourning before officially announcing his position as the new leader afterwards.

 his grandfather [X], the founder and leader of north korea until his death in 1994, is the country's "eternal president", while his father [Y] who succeeded [X] as the leader was announced "eternal general secretary" and "eternal chairman of the national defence commission" after his death in 2011.

 the control the north korean government exercises over many aspects of the nation's culture is used to perpetuate the cult of personality surrounding [X], and [Y].

 while visiting north korea in 1979, journalist bradley martin wrote that nearly all music, art, and sculpture that he observed glorified "great leader" [X], whose personality cult was then being extended to his son, "dear leader" [Y].

 following the death of [X], north koreans were prostrating and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event; similar scenes were broadcast by state television following the death of [Y].

 one point of view is that [Y]'s cult of personality was solely out of respect for [X] or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage, while north korean government sources consider it genuine hero worship.

 portraits and sculptures depicting [X], [Y] and kim jong-un are classed as "number one works".

 the event is an artistic representation of the country's history and pays homage to [X] and [Y].

 [X]'s son, [Y], succeeded him, and was in turn succeeded by his son, kim jong-un.

in october 1980, [Y] was introduced to the public at the sixth party congress as the successor to [X].

 the politics in the last years of [X] closely resemble those of the beginning of the [Y] era.

after the death of [X] in 1994, his son, [Y] reigned as the new leader, which marked the closure of one chapter of north korean politics.

 in april 1997, on the 85th anniversary of [X]'s birthday, [Y] promoted 127 general and admiral grade officers.

after [X]'s death in 1994, some members of [Y]'s faction proposed changing the name of pyongyang to "[X] city" (), but others suggested that north korea should begin calling seoul "[X] city" instead and grant pyongyang the moniker "[Y] city".

 [X] became the supreme leader until his death in 1994, after which his son, [Y] took power.

 it is comparable in many ways to that of mao zedong in china and of [X] and [Y] in north korea.

 according to lim jae-cheon, kim cannot have been born in vyatskoye as [X]'s war records show that he arrived at vyatskoye only in july 1942 and had been living in voroshilov before, thus [Y] is generally agreed to have been born in voroshilov.

 another flower, kimilsungia, is an orchid cultivar named after [Y]'s father and predecessor, [X].

 [X] organized his resistance against the japanese forces there, and north korea claims that [Y] was born there, although records outside of north korea suggest that he was actually born in the soviet union.

 other communist leaders with pronounced cults of personality such as mao zedong, [X], ho chi minh, [Y] and most recently hugo chávez have also had their cadavers preserved in the fashion of lenin's preservation and are now displayed in their respective mausoleums.

in north korea, manse was used to wish long life for [Y], and for the political principles of his father, [X].

after [Y]'s death in 2011, he received a similar treatment to his father [X], being declared "eternal general secretary of the workers' party of korea" and "eternal chairman of the national defense commission".

 currently, embalmed communist leaders can also be found in the mausoleum of mao zedong, the ho chi minh mausoleum, and the kumsusan palace of the sun for [X] and [Y].

[X] developed the ideology, which was originally viewed as a variant of marxism–leninism until it was declared a distinct ideology by his son and successor, [Y].

 north korean state media had previously described [X]'s ideas as "contemporary marxism–leninism"; by calling them "kimilsungism", [Y] sought to elevate the ideas of his father to the same level of prestige as stalinism and maoism.

 as well as stating that the wpk was "the party of [X] and [Y]", the conference proclaimed kimilsungism–kimjongilism as "the only guiding idea of the party".

 in the 4th conference's aftermath, the korean central news agency (kcna) stated that "the korean people have long called the revolutionary policies ideas of the president [[X]] and [Y] as kimilsungism–kimjongilism and recognized it as the guiding of the nation".

 thanks to [X], [Y] argued, the revolution had "put forward original lines and policies suited to our people's aspirations and the specific situation of our country".

 mass games are the culminating annual celebrations of the state leader's birthdays and the rituals commemorating the foundation of the state: on the birthdays of [X] (april 15, 1912), the founding father of north korea, and [Y] (born february 16, 1942), the former leader of the state.

 [X] and [Y] badges

in the early 1980s, [Y] sought to reduce the song's importance to the benefit of "song of general [X]".

"song of general [X]" and "song of general [Y]" have since taken the place of de facto national anthems domestically, and "aegukka" is reserved for representing north korea internationally: when foreign dignitaries visit the country or north korean athletes compete at international sporting competitions.

 instead of depicting the portrait of north korea's founder [X], the note depicts an image of his birthplace in mangyondae and on the back the international friendship exhibition in myohyangsan that displays gifts he and his son [Y] received from foreign leaders.

 there has been ongoing speculation that this could indicate plans for higher denominations to be released later which would depict [X], [Y], or possibly both.

 many older musical forms remain and are used in both traditional performances that have been attuned to the ideas and the way of life of the modern north korean communist state and to accompany modern songs in praise of [X], his son and successor, [Y], and kim jong-un from 2012 onward, plus songs that wish for a reunited korea, thus creating a mix of traditional and western music that is truly north korean, a unique variant of korean music as a whole mixing the old and the new.

 because [Y] aimed to keep his affair with song a secret due to the disapproval of his father [X], he initially kept jong-nam out of school, instead sending him to live with song's older sister song hye-rang, who tutored him at home.

 these reports were supported in april 2009 when kim jong-un assumed a low-level position within the ruling workers' party since [Y] was groomed by his own father, [X], in a similar way before becoming north korean leader in 1994.

 a similar campaign was launched in praise of [Y]'s mother (kim jong-suk) during the later years of [X]'s life.

 this held true when [X] died in 1994 and was succeeded by [Y], who in turn was succeeded by kim jong-un in 2011.

the north korean government promotes the cult of personality of [Y] and [X], described as a political religion, as well as the juche ideology, based on korean ultranationalism, which calls on people to "avoid spiritual deference to outside influences", which was interpreted as including religion originating outside of korea.

it was the period when the wpk was focusing ideologically on [X]'s juche; while [Y] actively stood for this process, kim yong-ju, having studied in russia, supported a more classical view of marxism and was not fond of the extensive personality cult built around his brother.

 this played to [Y]'s advantage: kim yong-ju was more and more marginalized, his key allies kim to-man (director of propaganda) and  (director of international liaison) were removed, and he himself was finally attacked by [X].

 there was no official reason for its postponement, but it was probably due to the fact that wpk general secretary [X] spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor [Y].

 the primary reason for the 6th congress was to formalize [Y] as [X]'s chosen successor.

significant at the 6th congress was the generational shift within the wpk, with [X] planning to formalize the position of [Y].

as the inspector arrives and the parade asked to order arms and stand at ease, the fanfare trumpeters sound a fanfare, and as another 21-gun salute is fired the massed bands play both the "song of general [X]" and the "song of general [Y]", followed by the keynote national address by a high-ranking member of the party political bureau or in some cases, the supreme leader himself.

 following this, the parade renders a general salute to the memory of both [X] and [Y] as limousines carrying their portraits are driven past, with red flag bearers (formerly colour bearers of kpa formations) escorting them while the massed bands play, the echelons are led by veteran officers of the kpa.

[X] and [Y] badges are lapel pins with portraits depicting either one or both of the eternal leaders of north korea, [X] and [Y].

 common examples include red flag-shaped pins depicting either president [X] or general secretary [Y], smaller circular pins with the same portraits on white backgrounds (often with silver or gold edging), and larger flag-shaped pins depicting both leaders.

badges bearing the portrait of [Y] appeared in 1982, and many started to wear one alongside their [X] badges.

 the first badge containing both [X] and [Y] appeared in the 1980s, but is different from the present double badge reserved for security services cadres.

 [Y] badges were discontinued in the 1990s following his alleged remark: "how can i be presented on the same level as our sole 'sun', [X]?".

 although for tourists, according to josh thomas, the actual "price of drinking north korean beer is bowing to a lot of statues of [X] and [Y], listening to their version of the korean war, and eating anything and everything they give you to eat".

 this was either to highlight the relations with finland or to move him out of pyongyang in order to prevent a power struggle with his half-brother [Y], who succeeded [X].

 meats – meat consumption tends to be rare in north korea, and most citizens only have access to meats during the public holidays of the birthdays of [X] and [Y], when extra meat is included in government rations provided to north koreans.

vice president of the democratic people's republic of korea () was a political position in north korea established in 1972, and abolished after the death of [X] during the reign of [Y].

 portraits of [Y] have been hung next to [X] since the late 1970s.

at the end of the decade, north koreans were told to hang portraits of [Y] next to their portraits of [X].

 in the 1990s, a third kind of portrait was added that depicts [Y] and [X] engaged in discussion about state management.

 high-ranking officials were given yet another portrait, that of [X]'s first wife and mother of [Y], kim jong-suk.

 the current versions of the portraits consists of [X] in a western-style suit and [Y] wearing his trademark green jumpsuit.

 taking part in these efforts were some of the first signs of [Y] rising in political profile thus readying to succeed his father [X] as the leader of north korea.

 first, during the 1980s and the early 1990s when [Y] was first publicly named in north korean media and [X] started giving him official titles and as [X] started to face poor health, his son was eventually de-facto leader of north korea.

based on the 1996 essay by mansudae ballerina shin young-hee until the rhododendron blooms, which portrays north korean society during [X]'s regime, the show dramatize her life in the north of the peninsula, the public execution of woo in-hee, a mistress of north korean leader [Y], which she personally witnessed, and her defection to south korea.

 died: [X], 66, american farmer known from the little house on the prairie books written by his daughter, [Y], and the television series adaptation, where he was portrayed by michael landon.

 he was the younger brother of [Y], and the younger son of [X] and eve, the first couple in biblical history.

 young taught that the day would come when black men would again have the priesthood, saying that after "all the other children of [X] have the privilege of receiving the priesthood, and of coming into the kingdom of god, and of being redeemed from the four-quarters of the earth, and have received their resurrection from the dead, then it will be time enough to remove the curse from [Y] and his posterity.

after many generations of [X] have passed from the lines of [Y] and seth, the world becomes corrupted by human sin and nephilim, and god wants to wipe out humanity for their wickedness.

 [X] is said to be perfect until he recognises either his sin or [Y]'s fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world.

an area of questioning involved the book of genesis, including questions about whether eve was actually created from [X]'s rib, where [Y] got his wife, and how many people lived in ancient egypt.

 indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about mc[Y] himself leaving the republican party, but mc[Y] had always [X]antly denied that he ever considered doing so.

seth, in judaism, christianity, mandaeism, sethianism, and islam, was the third son of [X] and eve and brother of [Y] and abel, their only other child mentioned by name in the hebrew bible.

similar to the internalized spiritual death god warns [X] and eve of from eating the forbidden fruit - they do not physically die immediately but over the course of time their bodies age and die - the lord warns [Y] that his inappropriate anger is waiting to consume him: "if you do what is right, will you not be accepted? but if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.

 this can be seen with jubilees 4 which narrates that [Y] settled down and married his sister awan, who bore their first son, the first enoch, approximately 196 years after the creation of [X].

in jewish tradition, philo, pirke de-rabbi eliezer and the targum pseudo-jonathan asserted that [X] was not the father of [Y].

 and so, after [Y] would not consent to this arrangement, [X] suggested seeking god's blessing by means of a sacrifice.

a millennia-old explanation for [Y] being capable of murder is that he may have been the offspring of a fallen angel or satan himself, rather than being the son of [X].

 the apocryphal life of [X] and eve tells of eve having a dream in which [Y] drank his brother's blood.

according to abū Ṭālib al-mufaḍḍal (a-n-naḥawī al-lughawī) ibn salma (9th century), who himself refers to hishām ibn al-kullā, the oud was invented by lamech, the descendant of [X] and [Y].

 his series picked up several years after the tv series ended, and featured apollo in command of the galactica after the death of [X]a, a grown-up boxey, who was now a viper pilot, and the rediscovery of commander [Y] and the battlestar pegasus, who had started a new colony and was preparing to restart the war with the cylons.

[X]'s sons, caleb ("cal") and aron – echoing [Y] and abel – grow up oblivious of their mother's situation.

in the novel, [X], samuel, and lee have a significant conversation in which they realize that since abel died before he had children, they themselves are the descendants of [Y].

  however, this does not correspond to the text of genesis, which states that contemporary humans are descended neither from [Y] nor abel, but from [X] and eve's third son, seth.

dual seedline christian identity proponents— those who believe that eve bore children with satan as well as with [X] —believe that eve was seduced by the serpent (satan), shared her fallen state with [X] by having sex with him, and gave birth to twins with different fathers: satan's son [Y] and [X]'s son abel.

 according to the "dual seedline" form of christian identity, [Y] then became the progenitor of the jews in his subsequent matings with members of the non-[X]ic races.

in the biblical book of genesis, [Y] and abel are the first two sons of [X] and eve.

 this theory would make the names descriptive of their roles, where abel works with livestock, and [Y] with agriculture—and would parallel the names [X] () and eve ().

 modern scholars typically view the stories of [X] and eve and [Y] and abel to be about the development of civilization during the age of agriculture; not the beginnings of man, but when people first learned agriculture, replacing the ways of the hunter-gatherer.

 both [Y] and abel desired to marry [X]'s beautiful daughter, aclima (arabic: aqlimia).

 this led some scholars, such as sa'id ibn al-musayyib, to think that the sons of [X] mentioned in the quran are actually two israelites, not [Y] and abel.

a millennia-old explanation for [Y] being capable of murder is that he may have been the offspring of a fallen angel or satan himself, rather than being from [X].

in 1917, during the last months of legal prostitution in storyville, the red-light district of new orleans, louisiana, hattie is a prostitute working at an elegant brothel run by the elderly, co[Y]e-sniffing m[X]e nell.

 the account states that [Y], the son of [X] from the bible, had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men.

 the musical is based on the book of genesis, with act i telling the story of [X] and eve, [Y], and abel, while act ii deals with noah and the flood.

 the production was directed by john caird, and starred ken page as father, richard lloyd-king as the snake, martin smith as [X], shezwae powell as eve, adrian beaumont as [Y], kevin colson as noah, earlene bentley as mama noah, frances ruffelle as yonah, anthony barclay as japheth, craig pinder as shem, ray shell as ham, hiromi itoh as aysha and ruthie henshall as aphra.

the cast featured william solo as father, adrian zmed as [X]/noah, stephanie mills as eve/mama noah, darius de haas as [Y]/japheth, hunter foster as abel/ham, and kelli rabke as yonah.

  the concert featured ron bohmer as father, ashley brown as eve/mama noah, charl brown as [X]/noah, rebecca naomi jones as yonah, and jeremy jordan as [Y]/japheth.

 [X] and eve are driven out of the garden by father into the wasteland surrounding the garden and have two children, [Y] and abel ("the expulsion" and "the wasteland").

several years later, [X], eve, [Y], and abel continue their lives, hoping and praying that father will one day bring them home to eden.

 [Y] complains to abel that their parents won't let them see the world beyond the glen and that [X] and eve seemingly let themselves get kicked out of eden ("lost in the wilderness").

[X] and eve, deeply worried about [Y]'s safety out in the wasteland, find some comfort in the fact that they have been able to create a life and family for themselves outside of eden ("close to home"), but this peacefulness is once again shattered when [Y], back from his journey, tells the family that he has found a ring of giant stones, seemingly providing evidence of other humans.

 [X]'s betrayal quickly leads to a family-wide fight, culminating in [Y] threatening to leave forever and taking abel with him.

 [Y], beginning to leave, is forcibly stopped by [X], who slaps [Y], which sends him to the ground.

 [Y] tells [X] that he will kill him and the two attempt to fight, but when abel intervenes, he is thrown off [Y], who, in his rage, beats him to death with a stone ("the death of abel").

 [Y] leaves the remaining members of his family, telling [X] that it should have been him that should be dead.

 she attempts to speak to father about [Y]'s departure from the family, [X]'s grief over the loss of both his sons, the birth of another son, seth, who has since had children of his own, and [X]'s recent death.

  it escalates into a fight, directly mirroring the one between [X] and [Y] generations ago, and it is only because yonah intervenes that one of the brothers is not killed.

 [X] and eve had two sons, [Y] and abel (qayin and heḇel), the first a tiller of the ground, the second a keeper of sheep.

 the most famous of [X]'s children are [Y] and abel.

in the second-season episode "pegasus", admiral helena [Y] cites [X]a's closure of the tribunal in denying his request for a jury court-martial for helo and tyrol.

" [Y] relates to [X]a and president laura roslin how she ordered a risky maneuver to escape the initial cylon attack on the twelve colonies.

 [X]a recognizes [Y] as his superior officer, but [Y] promises not to interfere with galacticas internal affairs.

[Y] declines to resupply the fleet's civilian ships and integrates the battlestars' crews, transferring apollo and starbuck to pegasus over commander [X]a's objections.

 [X]a reiterates his willingness to follow [Y], to both roslin and tigh, and insists that apollo and starbuck obey their transfer orders.

 [Y] denies [X]a's request that helo and tyrol be given a jury court-martial and sentences them both to death for murder and treason.

 [X]a demands that [Y] return them to galactica and orders vipers to escort a marine assault team to pegasus.

a conversation between [Y] and [X]a makes clear that pegasus is much larger, more advanced, and more powerful than galactica.

davis compares [X]a's defiance of [Y] to apollo's mutiny in "kobol's last gleaming".

 eick says the amount [X]a looks at [Y] in "pegasus" indicates that he respects her.

 moore abandoned several elements of the original-series episode involving [Y], "the living legend"; the main similarities in his view are [Y] appearing suddenly in the pegasus and being "more of a hardass character than commander [X]a.

" moore considers the key differences to be [Y]'s gender and her authority over [X]a.

in the episode, admiral helena [Y] and commander william [X]a call a truce but plan to assassinate each other.

 [Y] and [X]a both cancel their plots, but gina escapes from the pegasus brig and kills [Y].

 [X]a ordered galactica's vipers launched toward pegasus, and [Y] ordered the pegasus vipers to intercept them.

both viper groups seek permission to fire, but neither [Y] nor [X]a grants it.

 [Y] and [X]a call off their attacks and agree to meet on colonial one as neutral ground.

 later, roslin warns [X]a privately that [Y] will strike against [X]a again and urges him to assassinate [Y] first.

 realizing that roslin is right about [Y], [X]a orders starbuck to assassinate [Y] once the attack on the cylon fleet concludes.

 likewise, [Y] directs fisk to take a detachment of marines to galactica to kill [X]a after the attack.

 [Y] and [X]a contact fisk and starbuck respectively, but neither gives the order to assassinate.

[Y]'s decision not to kill [X]a demonstrates that she is "human and.

 however, the contrast between [Y]'s decision to pillage her civilian fleet and [X]a's decision to protect his reflects "an issue of character rather than humanizing circumstance" (emphasis clifton's).

starbuck is conflicted over her loyalty to [X]a and apollo and her hope that [Y] will help her rescue anders.

amanda keith of the los angeles newspaper group disputes starbuck's assertion in the eulogy that the fleet was safer with [Y] in command; keith attributes starbuck's assessment to dissatisfaction with [X]a and roslin's leadership and ignorance of [Y]'s past misdeeds.

 keith also believes roslin is mistaken in her assessment of [Y] as irredeemable; after all, [Y] did back down from killing [X]a.

 lauritsen maintains that revisions to frankenstein made in 1823 and 1831 weakened the work, and that while it was ostensibly [Y] who revised frankenstein into its 1831 form, it may primarily have been revised by the political philosopher [X].

 robinson also rejected lauritsen's thesis, arguing that the testimony of authors such as lord byron, [X], claire clairmont, charles clairmont, and leigh hunt, as well as the "nature of the manuscript evidence", showed that the work was "conceived and mainly written by [Y]".

 when she found [Y] teasing isaac, sarah told abraham to send both [Y] and [X] away.

early the next morning, abraham brought [X] and [Y] out together.

 this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by abraham when sarah demanded that he expel [X] and [Y].

 the book of genesis narrates that god promised [X] to beget from [Y] twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.

 sarah had to get [Y] (son of [X]) out of her house because, legally, [Y] would always be the first-born son even though isaac was her natural child.

 in genesis, these include three different accounts of a patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of abraham sending [X] and [Y] into the desert.

 through [X], abraham fathers [Y].

 sarah then drives [Y] and his mother [X] out into the wilderness (because [Y] is not her real son and [X] is a slave), but god saves them and promises to make [Y] a great nation.

 although this was abraham's second son (abraham's first son was [Y], with [X]) it was sarah's first and only child.

after isaac had been weaned, sarah saw [Y] mocking, and urged her husband to cast out [X] the bondservant and her son, so that isaac would be abraham's sole heir.

 paul contrasted isaac, symbolizing christian liberty, with the rejected older son [Y], symbolizing slavery; [X] is associated with the sinai covenant, while sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son isaac enters.

in the islamic view, the beginnings of mecca are attributed to the biblical figures, abraham, [X] and [Y].

 the civilization of mecca is believed to have started after ibrāhīm (abraham) left his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar ([X]) in the valley at allah's command.

 moses's mother, jochebed, being inspired to send the infant moses in a cradle down the nile river is a frequently cited example of inspiration, as is [X] searching for water for the infant [Y].

 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that [Y]ites chose to be called saracens in order to identify with abraham's "free" wife sarah, rather than as [X]enes, which would have highlighted their association with abraham's "slave woman" [X].

 the following year he exhibited his first work, [X] and [Y].

 when [Y] was grown, someone appeared to abraham in a dream and said to him: "keep your vow which you made! god bestowed upon you a boy by [X] so that you may sacrifice him" so he said to [Y]: "let us go offer a sacrifice to god!" so he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains.

 [Y] then said to him: "make tight my bonds, so that i will not struggle to pull back your clothes so that none of my blood will be shed on them for [X] will see it and be grieved.

 he replied: "by god, his actual intention is to sacrifice you!" he said: "why?!" iblis replied: "he claims that his lord has ordered him to do so!" [Y] replied: "he must do what his lord commands, absolutely!" when the young man had rebuffed him, iblis went to [X], the mother of [Y] who was still at home.

 certain episodes from the life of abraham have been more heavily detailed in islamic text, such as the arguments between abraham and the evil king, nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of [X] and [Y], which muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in mecca.

1659: abraham casting out [X] & [Y] – guilford college collection, greensboro, north carolina

the region, according to islamic tradition, is the birthplace of the islamic prophet muhammad, who was born in mecca, which is locally considered to have been founded by the islamic prophets abraham and [Y], and matriarch [X].

according to arab and islamic sources, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm (abraham) brought his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar ([X]) here, for the latter two to stay.

[X] and [Y]

 it was during this banquet that sarah happened upon the then teenaged [Y] mocking isaac and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and [X] be banished.

 [X] became pregnant with [Y].

 she would ultimately demand that abraham send [X] and [Y] away and so, abraham banished them and sent them into the desert.

 in genesis 17:15, god changes her name to sarah (princess) ("a woman of high rank") as part of the covenant with el shaddai after [X] bears abram his first born son [Y].

 however, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with abraham, [X], and [Y].

 she is not portrayed as abraham's sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of terah's brother, haran, and [X] is not portrayed as abraham's mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that sarah feels for [X] during her pregnancy and toward [Y].

 in 1835, corot created a sensation at the salon with his biblical painting agar dans le desert ([X] in the wilderness), which depicted [X], sarah's handmaiden, and the child [Y], dying of thirst in the desert until saved by an angel.

 his chief earlier pictures have a religious interest, shown in such examples as the flight into egypt (1877), or [X] and [Y] (1880, luxembourg); and afterwards his combination of luminous landscape with figure-subjects (souvenir de fête, 1881; journée faite, 1888) gave him a wide repute, and made him the leader of a new school of idealistic subject-painting in france.

[Y] was the first son of abraham through the egyptian [X] (), the common patriarch of the abrahamic religions, and is venerated by muslims as a prophet.

jewish, christian and islamic traditions consider [Y] to be the ancestor of the [Y]ites ([X]enes or arabians) and patriarch of qaydār.

 according to muslim tradition, in which he is regarded as an ancestor of muhammad, [Y] thereby founded a great nation as promised by god in the old testament, and was buried with his mother [X] (hājar) next to the kaaba in mecca, under the area demarcated by the semi-circular hijr ismail wall.

  describes the naming of [Y], and god's promise to [X] concerning [Y] and his descendants.

 this occurred at the well of beer-lahai-roi, where [X] encountered the angel of the lord, who said to her "behold, you are with child / and shall bear a son; / you shall call him [Y], / for the lord has paid heed to your suffering.

rabbinical commentators in the midrash genesis rabbah also say that [Y]'s mother [X] was the pharaoh's daughter, making [Y] the pharaoh's grandson.

 according to genesis 21:21, [X] married [Y] to an egyptian woman, and if rabbinical commentators are correct that [X] was the pharaoh's daughter, his marriage to a woman she selected could explain how and why his sons became princes.

according to other jewish commentators, [Y]'s mother [X] is identified with keturah, the woman abraham sought out and married after sarah's death.

 like christians and jews, muslims believe that [Y] was the firstborn of abraham, born to him from his wife sarah's slave, [X].

 [X] soon bore [Y], who was the first son of abraham.

 god then instructed abraham to take [X] and [Y] to the desert and leave them there.

 to commemorate the blessing of the zamzam well god gave to [X] and [Y], muslims run between the safa and marwah hills retracing [X]'s steps during the rites of hajj.

the name [Y] is biblical in origin: in genesis 16:1-16; 17:18-25; 21:6-21; 25:9-17, [Y] was the son of abraham by the servant [X].

 at intervals came from his studio such pieces as the red cross knight, abraham offering up isaac, [X] and [Y] in the wilderness, the death of major peirson, the arrest of five members of the commons by charles the first, the siege of gibraltar, the surrender of admiral dewindt to lord camperdown, the offer of the crown to lady jane grey by the dukes of northumberland and suffolk, the resurrection, and others.

 abraham's firstborn son, through [X], [Y], became the progenitor of the [Y]ites, generally taken to be the arabs.

 she was so upset by the idea of [Y] inheriting their wealth, that she demanded that abraham send [X] and her son away.

early the next morning, abraham brought [X] and [Y] out together.

  he also told [X] that god  would "make a great nation" of [Y].

the quranic narrative slightly differs from the biblical account: it is allah alone who commands abraham to take [X] and [Y] down to the desert, later mecca, and leave them there.

 he helped her and said that god heard [Y] cry and would provide them with water, and [X] found the sacred zamzam well.

 later, mecca was known for its perfection and abundant water and an arab tribe called banu jurhum settled there with [X] and her son [Y], because of the presence of the water.

 they further argue that [X] and [Y] were not cast out as claimed by biblical narrative, but they were settled at makkah (paran) for the sake of almighty allah.

 william shakespeare refers to [X] in the merchant of venice act ii scene 5 line 40 when shylock says "what says that fool of [X]'s offspring, ha?" this line refers to the character launcelot, whom shylock is insulting by comparing him to the outcast [Y].

in islamic tradition, bakkah is where [X] and [Y] (ismā'īl) settled after being taken by abraham (ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story parallel to the bible's book of genesis (21:14-21)(but see below for the biblical geography).

 genesis tells that abraham gave [X] a bottle of water, and that [X] and [Y] ran out of water to drink in beer-sheba.

the islamic tradition holds that a spring gushed forth from the spot where [X] had laid [Y], and this spring came to be known as the well of zamzam.

in addition to the islamic tradition that [X] and [Y] settled in bakkah, the quran relates that abraham came to mecca to help his son [Y] build the kaaba adjacent to the well of zamzam.

 he also appears twice to [X], the slave-girl who has abraham's first child, [Y] ().

all three jamarāt represent the devil: the first and largest represents his temptation of abraham against sacrificing [Y] (ismāʿīl); the second represents the temptation of abraham's wife [X] (hājar) to induce her to stop him; the third represents his temptation of [Y] to avoid being sacrificed.

according to islamic tradition, abraham and [Y], his son by [X], built the kaʿbah as the house of god.

according to ibn ishaq, the buraq transported abraham when he visited [X] and [Y].

 romantic outlaws: the extraordinary lives of [X] & [Y]'', random house.

charlotte gordon is an american writer, distinguished professor of humanities at endicott college, and winner of the national book critics circle award in nonfiction for her book romantic outlaws: the extraordinary lives of [X] and [Y] (2015).

her most recent book, romantic outlaws: the extraordinary lives of [X] and [Y] (2015), is about the mother and daughter pair of writers.

in the summer of 1816, english poet percy shelley, his soon to be wife [Y] (daughter of william godwin and [X]), and mary's stepsister and companion claire clairmont take a holiday with lord byron and his physician john william polidori at a villa rented by byron at lake leman, switzerland.

[X], author of a vindication of the rights of woman, pioneer of women's rights and mother of [Y], lived at what is now 373–375 mare street in 1784.

on the last day of her visit, the owner of the letters permitted walker to view the 115 private letters to and from hays in correspondence with [X], william godwin, [Y], robert southey, eliza fenwick and others.

since the initial publication of [X] shelley's novel frankenstein in 1818, there has existed uncertainty about the extent to which [Y]'s husband, percy bysshe shelley, contributed to the text.

through his mother, jane allingham, owesen was related to [X], whose mother, elizabeth dickson, was a first cousin of his grandfather, john allingham, via their shared grandparent thomas dickson, and to her daughters [Y] and fanny imlay.

 various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after [X]; and, while promises are made to [Y] about founding a great nation, isaac, [X]'s son by his half-sister sarah, inherits god's promises to [X].

 [X] laughed, and "said in his heart, 'shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall sarah, that is ninety years old, bear [a child]?'" immediately after [X]'s encounter with god, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and [Y] (age 13), circumcised.

[Y] was fourteen years old when [X]'s son isaac was born to sarah.

 when she found [Y] teasing isaac, sarah told [X] to send both [Y] and hagar away.

early the next morning, [X] brought hagar and [Y] out together.

 according to the bible, reflecting the change of his name to "[X]" meaning "a father of many nations", [X] is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the bible, among others the israelites, [Y]ites, edomites, amalekites, kenizzites, midianites and assyrians, and through his nephew lot he was also related to the moabites and ammonites.

george segal created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work [X]'s farewell to [Y].

 this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by [X] when sarah demanded that he expel hagar and [Y].

 the tribes of central west arabia called themselves the "people of [X] and the offspring of [Y].

 the "arabized arabs" (mustaʿribah) of central arabia (najd) and north arabia, descending from [Y] the elder son of [X], through adnan (hence, adnanites).

 the book of jubilees claims that the sons of [Y] intermingled with the 6 sons of keturah, from [X], and their descendants were called arabs and [Y]ites:

 "arabized arabs" () or adnanites, taken to be the descendants of [Y] son of [X].

 but of course we must add since the commandment applies to [Y] as well as to issac, circumcision is the mark uniting those singular peoples, descended from [X], who recall not only his chastity but above all his dread in the presence of god; who share in that dread, and who understand the dread and the circumcision to be in part their response as mortal, hence reproductive, hence sexual creatures — created in the image of god — to the presence of the holy or pure god who as creator utterly transcends his mortal, reproductive creatures, and especially their sexuality.

 in genesis, these include three different accounts of a patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of [X] sending hagar and [Y] into the desert.

 through hagar, [X] fathers [Y].

 the first covenant is between god and all living creatures, and is marked by the sign of the rainbow; the second is with the descendants of [X] ([Y]ites and others as well as israelites), and its sign is circumcision; and the last, which does not appear until the book of exodus, is with israel alone, and its sign is sabbath.

 jews believe it is the site where [X] tried to sacrifice his son, isaac, while muslims believe that [X] tried to sacrifice his son, [Y], in mecca.

 although this was [X]'s second son ([X]'s first son was [Y], with hagar) it was sarah's first and only child.

after isaac had been weaned, sarah saw [Y] mocking, and urged her husband to cast out hagar the bondservant and her son, so that isaac would be [X]'s sole heir.

isaac, along with [Y], is highly important for muslims for continuing to preach the message of monotheism after his father [X].

 in the quran, it later narrates that [X] also praised god for giving him [Y] and isaac in his old age (14: 39–41).

elsewhere in the quran, isaac is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers [X], isaac and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "[X], [Y] and isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "[X], [Y], isaac, jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84).

according to the book of idols, descendants of the son of [X] ([Y]) who had settled in mecca migrated to other lands.

 in both jewish and muslim tradition, the jewish and arab peoples are descended from the two sons of [X]—isaac and [Y], respectively.

 according to muslim tradition, muhammad himself was a hanif and one of the descendants of [Y], son of [X].

 after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found for a historical [X] or [Y].

", while  commands the believers of islam to "say: we believe in god and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto [X] and [Y] and isaac and jacob and the tribes, and that which moses and jesus received, and which the prophets received from their lord.

 some of those that were mentioned are: adam, noah, [X], [Y], jacob, moses, and jesus and his apostles are all considered to be muslims in the qur'an.

 the great mosque of mecca, known as the masjid al-haram, is home to the ka'bah, believed by muslims to have been built by [X] and [Y].

in the islamic view, the beginnings of mecca are attributed to the biblical figures, [X], hagar and [Y].

 the civilization of mecca is believed to have started after ibrāhīm ([X]) left his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar (hagar) in the valley at allah's command.

 this is another irony in modern politics: the palestinians in truth are blood brothers or cousins of the modern israelis — they are all descendants of [X] and [Y], so to speak.

witnessed in the year 1800 bc with the arrival of the father of the prophets, prophet ibrahīm (the biblical [X]) to egypt during the occupation of the hyksos, and he married an egyptian slave girl named hajar (biblical hagar) from pelusium (modern-day northern qantara), and gave birth to prophet isma'īl (the biblical [Y]).

 this ritual is based on the islamic tradition that, when god ordered [X] to sacrifice his son [Y], satan tempted him three times not to do it, and, each time, [X] responded by throwing seven stones at him.

 adam, enoch, noah, eber, shelah, [X], lot, [Y], isaac, jacob, joseph, job, jethro, david, solomon, elijah, elisha, jonah, aaron, moses, zechariah, john the baptist and jesus are mentioned in the quran as prophets of god (see prophets of islam).

 saracens were associated with [Y]ites (descendants of [X]'s older son [Y]) in some strands of jewish, christian, and islamic genealogical thinking.

 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that [Y]ites chose to be called saracens in order to identify with [X]'s "free" wife sarah, rather than as hagarenes, which would have highlighted their association with [X]'s "slave woman" hagar.

 to justify this view, it references a passage of the quran, which mentions that the sons of yaʿqūb (jacob) referred to his uncle ismāʿīl ([Y]), father is-ḥāq (isaac) and grandfather ibrāhīm ([X]) as his ābāʾ ():

many muslims still claim descent from rechab, along with the nearly-universal claim of arabs to be descended from [X] through [Y] (ismail).

 there has been a historical account of rams' horns preserved in the kaaba until the year 683, which are believed to be the remains of the sacrifice of [Y] - the first son of [X], who most muslims believe was the son [X] tied down and almost sacrificed, and not isaac.

the scriptures have traced the patronymic lineage of the seventy nations to the three sons of noah, as also the lineage of [X] and [Y], and of jacob and esau.

the next burial in the cave is that of [X] himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons isaac and [Y].

in legends of the jews, rabbi louis ginzberg argues that the binding of isaac is a way for god to test isaac's claim to [Y], and to silence satan's protest about [X] who had not brought up any offering to god after isaac was born, also to show a proof to the world that [X] is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of god's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:

 one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than [Y] (notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari) interpreting the verse "god's perfecting his mercy on [X] and isaac" as referring to his making [X] his closest one, and to his rescuing isaac.

according to the islamic faith, [X] ( ) was a prophet and messenger of god, and an ancestor to the [Y]ite arabs and israelites.

 muslims believe that the kaaba in mecca was built by [X] and his son [Y] as the first house of worship on earth.

 [X] and isma'il ([Y]) further established the rites of pilgrimage, or Ḥajj ('pilgrimage'), which are still followed by muslims today.

 [X] had two children, [Y] and isaac, who both later became prophets.

 when [Y] was grown, someone appeared to [X], invites him to keep his vow.

 when [Y] was grown, someone appeared to [X] in a dream and said to him: "keep your vow which you made! god bestowed upon you a boy by hagar so that you may sacrifice him" so he said to [Y]: "let us go offer a sacrifice to god!" so he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains.

the second strand, provided by tabari, states that [X] was about to sacrifice his son [Y], and iblis appeared in form of a man to prevent the sacrifice.

 iblis, the enemy of god, gave up on [X] but then he encountered [Y], who was behind [X] carrying the wood and the large knife.

 iblis said to her: "oh mother of [Y]! do you realize where [X] is going with [Y]?" she replied: "they have gone to gather wood for us in the mountains".

 other verses mention the near-sacrifice of [X]'s son, whose name is not given but is presumed to be [Y] as the following verses mention the birth of isaac.

 the quran also repeatedly establishes [X]'s role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including isaac, jacob and [Y].

 the quran mentions that [X] and [Y] were the reformers who set up the ka‘bah in mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheism the quran consistently refers to islam as "the religion of [X]" (millat ibrahim) and [X] is given a title as hanif (the pure, "true in faith" or "upright man").

 certain episodes from the life of [X] have been more heavily detailed in islamic text, such as the arguments between [X] and the evil king, nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of hagar and [Y], which muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in mecca.

 an important islamic religious holiday, eid al-adha, commemorates [X]'s willingness to sacrifice his son [Y] as an act of obedience to god, before god intervened to provide him with a sheep to sacrifice instead.

 the sacrifice of [X]: isaac or [Y]?

 examples were often presented and discussed in later jewish exegesis with, according to [X] joshua heschel (1907-1972), an ongoing discourse between those who would follow the views of rabbi [Y] (born 90 ce) that "the torah speaks in human language", compared to the more mystical approach of rabbi akiva ( 50 – 135 ce) that any such deviations should signpost some deeper order or purpose, to be divined.

1659: [X] casting out hagar & [Y] – guilford college collection, greensboro, north carolina

the region, according to islamic tradition, is the birthplace of the islamic prophet muhammad, who was born in mecca, which is locally considered to have been founded by the islamic prophets [X] and [Y], and matriarch hagar.

era of [X] and [Y] 

according to arab and islamic sources, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm ([X]) brought his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar (hagar) here, for the latter two to stay.

 she would ultimately demand that [X] send hagar and [Y] away and so, [X] banished them and sent them into the desert.

sometime after the birth of [Y] but before the birth of isaac, sarah and [X] travel to gerar, as described in genesis 20, where events took place which mirrored those of mizraim, in which a king, this time abimelech, took an interest in sarah for her beauty and, as he had done in mizraim, [X] presented himself as her brother instead of her husband and so, believing her unmarried abimelech took her into her house as pharaoh had though, this time, yahweh intervened before he touched sarah, through dreams and plague.

 however, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with [X], hagar, and [Y].

 she is not portrayed as [X]'s sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of terah's brother, haran, and hagar is not portrayed as [X]'s mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that sarah feels for hagar during her pregnancy and toward [Y].

 the firstborn son of [X], [Y], is considered by muslims to be the father of the arabs.

[Y] - the first-born son of [X] - has 12 sons/princes (genesis 25:16), and jacob also has 12 sons, who are the progenitors of the twelve tribes of israel.

 muslims hold isaac in deep veneration because they believe that both isaac and his older half-brother [Y] continued their father's spiritual legacy through their subsequent preaching of the message of god after the death of [X].

 isaac was the age of 10 when his half-brother [Y] went out from [X]’s house into the desert.

 in the quran, it later narrates that [X] also praised god for giving him [Y] and isaac in his old age (xiv: 39-41).

elsewhere in the quran, isaac is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers [X], isaac and jacob (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); yaʿqūb's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "[X], [Y] and isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "[X], [Y], isaac, jacob and the patriarchs" (2: 136; iii: 84).

[Y] was the first son of [X] through the egyptian hagar (), the common patriarch of the [X]ic religions, and is venerated by muslims as a prophet.

in , the birth of [Y] was planned by the patriarch [X]'s first wife, who at that time was known as sarai.

 god would make of [Y] a great nation because he was of the seed of [X].

 when [Y] was born, [X] was 86 years old.

when he was 13 years old, [Y] was circumcised at the same time as all other males in [X]'s household, becoming a part of the covenant in a mass circumcision.

 god told [X] that he would establish his covenant through isaac, and when [X] inquired as to [Y]'s role, god answered that [Y] has been blessed and that he "will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and i will make him a great nation.

a year later, [Y]'s half-brother isaac was born to [X] by his first wife sarah when she was 90 years old (), after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility ().

on the day of feasting during which [X] celebrated the weaning of isaac, [Y] was "mocking" or "playing with" isaac (the hebrew word ,  is ambiguous) and sarah asked [X] to expel [Y] and his mother, saying: "get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son isaac.

" her demand was painful for [X], who loved  [Y].

 [X] agreed only after god told him that "in isaac your seed shall be called", and that god would "make a nation of the son of the bondwoman" [Y], since he was a descendant of [X] (), god having previously told [X] "i will establish my covenant with [isaac]", while also making promises concerning the [Y]ite nation ().

 the lord's covenant made clear [Y] was not to inherit [X]'s house and that isaac would be the seed of the covenant: "take your son, your only son, whom you love and go to the region of moriah.

[X] gave [Y] and his mother a supply of bread and water and sent them away.

[Y] appeared with isaac at the burial of [X].

some pre-islamic poetry mentions [Y], his father [X], and a sacrifice story, such as the pre-islamic poet "umayyah ibn abi as-salt", who said in one of his poems:  ([the sacrifice] of his first-born of whose separation he [[X]] could not bear neither could he see him surrounded in foes).

also, some of the tribes of central west arabia called themselves the "people of [X] and the offspring of [Y]", as evidenced by a common opening of speeches and harangues of reconciliation between rival tribes in that area.

in judaism, [Y] was inclined towards many things [X] considered wicked.

 according to the book of genesis, in the hebrew bible, isaac rather than [Y] was the true heir of the [X]ic tradition and covenant, while at the same time being blessed by god with a great nation.

according to other jewish commentators, [Y]'s mother hagar is identified with keturah, the woman [X] sought out and married after sarah's death.

 like christians and jews, muslims believe that [Y] was the firstborn of [X], born to him from his wife sarah's slave, hagar.

 in other chapters of the quran, however, which date from the medina period, [Y] is mentioned closely with his father [X]: [Y] stands alongside [X] in their attempt to set up the kaaba in mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage and [X] thanks god for granting him [Y] and isaac in his old age.

 [Y] is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations and jacob's sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers, "[X], [Y] and isaac", when testifying their faith.

 in the quranic narrative of the near-sacrifice of [X]'s son, the son is not named and, although the general interpretation is that it was [Y], tabari maintained that it was isaac, consistent with the hebrew scriptures.

 hagar soon bore [Y], who was the first son of [X].

 god then instructed [X] to take hagar and [Y] to the desert and leave them there.

[X] returned and visited [Y] at various times throughout his life.

 at one time, according to a tradition of muhammad, [X] had arrived when his son was out and [X] visited with [Y]'s wife.

 [X] decided to leave before seeing his son, but based upon the complaints [Y]'s wife made in response to his questions, he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home, which was "change his threshold.

 some time after this, [X] returned to visit [Y] and again [Y] was out.

 [X] talked with [Y]'s new wife and found her answers indicated faith in god and contentment with her husband.

" when [Y] returned that night, he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of [X]'s visit.

 islamic traditions hold that the kaaba was first built by adam and that [X] and [Y] rebuilt the kaaba on the old foundations.

the scriptures of the baháʼí faith state that it was [Y], and not isaac, who was the son [X] almost sacrificed.

the name [Y] is biblical in origin: in genesis 16:1-16; 17:18-25; 21:6-21; 25:9-17, [Y] was the son of [X] by the servant hagar.

 at intervals came from his studio such pieces as the red cross knight, [X] offering up isaac, hagar and [Y] in the wilderness, the death of major peirson, the arrest of five members of the commons by charles the first, the siege of gibraltar, the surrender of admiral dewindt to lord camperdown, the offer of the crown to lady jane grey by the dukes of northumberland and suffolk, the resurrection, and others.

 in islam the kaaba is believed to be a sacred site built by the prophets [X] and [Y], and that its use as the qibla was ordained by god in several verses of the quran revealed to muhammad in the second hijri year.

 according to the quran, it was built by [X] and [Y], both of whom are prophets in islam.

 according to islamic tradition was rebuilt by ibrahim ([X]) and his son ismail ([Y]).

yet another creation myth puts the origin of the arabian in the time of [Y], the son of [X].

 [X]'s firstborn son, through hagar, [Y], became the progenitor of the [Y]ites, generally taken to be the arabs.

 she was so upset by the idea of [Y] inheriting their wealth, that she demanded that [X] send hagar and her son away.

 [X] was greatly distressed but god told [X] to do as his wife commanded because god's promise would be carried out through isaac; [Y] would be made into a great nation as well because he was [X]'s offspring.

 later, before [X] died, he gave gifts to [Y] and his other sons and sent them away from isaac (gen 25:6).

 [Y] and isaac buried [X] together (gen 25:9).

early the next morning, [X] brought hagar and [Y] out together.

the quranic narrative slightly differs from the biblical account: it is allah alone who commands [X] to take hagar and [Y] down to the desert, later mecca, and leave them there.

hājar or haajar (arabic: هاجر), is the arabic name used to identify the wife of [X] (arabic: ibrāhīm) and the mother of [Y] (arabic: ismā'īl).

 [X] and [Y]

 [X]'s great grandson joseph, after being thrown into a pit by his brothers, was sold to either midianites or [Y]ites.

, it was shem who circumcised [X] and [Y] on the day of atonement; and the blood of the covenant then shed is ever before god on that day to serve as an atoning power.

 it honors the willingness of ibrahim ([X]) to sacrifice his son ismail ([Y]) as an act of obedience to allah's command.

in islamic tradition, bakkah is where hagar and [Y] (ismā'īl) settled after being taken by [X] (ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story parallel to the bible's book of genesis (21:14-21)(but see below for the biblical geography).

 genesis tells that [X] gave hagar a bottle of water, and that hagar and [Y] ran out of water to drink in beer-sheba.

in addition to the islamic tradition that hagar and [Y] settled in bakkah, the quran relates that [X] came to mecca to help his son [Y] build the kaaba adjacent to the well of zamzam.

 [Y] is mentioned in genesis at [X]'s funeral.

 his scenes include adam and eve their descendants, scenes from genesis, noah, jesus, mary magdaline, saul, king david, elijah, [Y], [X], and more.

 leaming simultaneously speculated that the "ben-[Y]" family name was actually derived from arabic to mean "ابن اسماعيل" (ibn ismail) or "son of [Y]," an islamic reference to muslims' supposed lineage through [Y], son of [X], via muhammad.

 muslim scholars traditionally consider [Y] as the firstborn of [X] mentioned in qur'an 37.

 for example, sam was an imam after noah, [Y] was an imam after [X], aaron or joshua after moses, simon, john and all the disciples after jesus, and ali and his descendants after muhammad.

 hagar bore ismā'īl ([Y]), when [X] was 86, who too would become a prophet of god like his father.

 according to islamic tradition, he was a descendant of ibrahim ([X]) through his son isma'il ([Y]).

 therefore, they are descendants of adnan, who is [Y]ite arab descendant of prophet isma'il ([Y]), son of ibrahim ([X]).

 the scrolls of [X] are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to [X], and later used by [Y] and isaac.

 that in the old testament, child sacrifice was prohibited, but this prohibition wasn't always obeyed; that a man's sexual history was never an issue (thus no such thing as a virginity requirement for men); the only religiously celibate jews were the essenes, but this was contrary to mainstream judaism; saint peter was married; saint paul thought that saint joseph had fathered jesus; "joseph 'did not know' mary 'until she has given birth to a son'" (she did not remain virgin, according to saint matthew), prophets were both male and female, the priesthood and the rabbinate were for men only, but phoebe was a deacon and junia was an apostle, the bible states that men are superior to women, polygyny was frequent, abortions were so rare that they were not a problem for the authors of the bible, but there was a ritual meant for making unfaithful women abort; the books of the bible were "kind of hypertext", yahweh visited [X], [Y] has probably sexually abused isaac; the bible does not state if adam and eve were married; there are biblical laws regulating polygyny, and "concubine" meant "secondary wife"; abishag laid with david but he was impotent, widows, rape victims and divorced women were "used goods", thus unworthy of a priest; the bible is inconsistent on divorce and "pervasively patriarchal"; the ten commandments were intended for jewish men only; marriage meant transfer of property, but women were inferior to real estate; adultery was about property rights; in the hebrew bible there was no ban on men having sex with unmarried women (including prostitutes); in david's time jerusalem had only a few thousand inhabitants; father-daughter incest was only a devaluation of daughter's value; onan was not masturbating; the bible is inconsistent about brother-sister incest; sex with a woman was prohibited during her period, but so is wearing wool and linen; david and jonathan were not sexual partners; sodom's sin was being inhospitable to strangers and "mistreatment of the powerless"; saint jude does not say that sodom's sin was homosexuality; "sacred prostitution" nowhere and "never took place"; the hebrew bible does not say anything about lesbianism, but saint paul thought that god made homosexuals so; jesus said very little about sexuality; the bible is opposed to homosexuality; having sex with prostitutes was seen as a way of losing money and saint paul opposed the use of prostitutes, but "judah's use of a prostitute was normal and acceptable", this also applies to samson, who also foreshadowed suicide bombers; mary magdalene wasn't a prostitute; god has reproductive organs and had a wife/wives; jews were initially polytheist, genesis 1:26-27 says that the elohim were male and female and humans were made in their image; god's sons had sex with women; yahweh is a sexual being, wisdom was god's wife, gods used to have children in many mythologies, israel was god's wife (polygyny wasn't a problem for him); "all theology is metaphor" and yahweh was "an insanely jealous and abusive husband".

eid al kabir (known as eid al-adha elsewhere), or "festival of sacrifice", is an important religious holiday celebrated by muslims worldwide to commemorate the willingness of [X] (ʾibrāhīm) to sacrifice his son [Y] (ismā'īl) as an act of obedience to god, before god intervened to provide him with a ram to sacrifice instead.

 consequently, while jacob fathered the 12 tribes of israel, [X] gave birth to [Y], while isaac gave birth to esau.

according to traditional islamic belief, zuhrah's father was kilab ibn murrah, a descendant of ibrahim ([X]) through his son ismail ([Y]).

 both his parents traced their lineage back to fihr, the progenitor of the quraysh, and further to ismail ([Y]), son of ibrahim ([X]).

 due to ali's status as an adnanite, the dynasty can trace its ancestry to [X] through his eldest son [Y].

 an incriminating letter lies on the floor, and a biblical painting – probably [X] casting out hagar and [Y], but possibly christ and the woman taken in adultery – hangs on the wall.

the maqām ibrāhīm () is a small square stone associated with ibrahim ([X]), ismail ([Y]) and their building of the kaaba in what is now the great mosque of mecca in the hejazi region of saudi arabia.

isaac was the age of 10 when his half-brother [Y] went out from [X]'s house into the desert.

[Y] was the first son of [X]; his mother was hagar.

[Y] and hagar taken to mecca by [X]

[Y] and hagar being taken to mecca by [X] in islamic texts is an important part in the story of [Y], as it brings the focus to mecca and is the beginning of mecca's sanctification as a holy area.

 islamic tradition says [X] was ordered by god to take hagar and [Y] to mecca, and later [X] returned to mecca to build the kaaba.

 in many of these accounts, the sakina (something like a wind or spirit sent by god), or the angel gabriel (jibral) guides them to the location of the kaaba, at which point [X] builds it and afterwards, leaves the other two there (other versions discussed below say the construction of the kaaba occurred later and that [Y] took part in it).

 generally, it is said that hagar asks [X] who he is entrusting herself and [Y] to as he leaves them.

muslims believe that [X] was told to sacrifice his son, [Y], though the qur'an does not mention the name of the son.

 some versions tell of the devil trying to stop god's command from being obeyed by visiting hagar, [Y], and [X].

 every time the devil says [X] is going to sacrifice [Y], each person answers that if god commanded it, they should obey.

 eventually, [X] tells [Y] about the order and [Y] is willing to be sacrificed and encourages [X] to listen to god.

 often, [Y] is portrayed as telling [X] some combination of instructions to bring his shirt back to hagar, bind him tightly, sharpen the knife, and place him face down, all so that there will be no wavering in the resolve to obey god.

as [X] attempts to slay [Y], either the knife is turned over in his hand or copper appears on [Y] to prevent the death and god tells [X] that he has fulfilled the command.

 since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of [X]'s son (and a prophet in islam at that), this replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalisation of sacrifice itself, or to the future self-sacrifices of the islamic prophet muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of [Y]) in the cause of their faith.

 the strongest case for [Y] in the quran is that directly after the sacrifice narrative, [X] is told of the coming of isaac's birth, therefore, it must be [Y] who was about to be sacrificed.

 [X] visited [Y] in mecca and when he arrived at his home, [Y] was not there.

 instead [Y]'s wife greets [X], but she was not welcoming or generous to him.

 [X] instructed her to tell [Y] some version of the statement that he was not pleased with or to change "the threshold of his door.

 [X] once again visited and was met by [Y]'s second wife, as [Y] was out.

 [X] instructed her to tell [Y] some version of the statement that he was pleased with "the threshold of his door.

" when [Y] arrived and his wife repeated [X]'s statement, [Y] knew it was from his father and kept his wife.

 of those that say [Y] took part in the construction, most describe [X] visited [Y] a third time in mecca, during which they raised the kaaba.

 some say [Y] looked for a final stone, but [X] did not accept the one he brought back.

 as the islamic community became more powerful, some jewish midrash about [Y] was modified so that he was portrayed more negatively in order to challenge the islamic view that [Y], and thus the muslims, were the favoured descendants of [X].

 in this manner, muhammad's ancestry leads back to [Y], joining "original biblical ancestry of [X] with a distinctively arab afinal stock," and connecting muhammad with mecca and the kaaba.

 due to ali's status as an adnanite, the dynasty can trace its ancestry to [X] through his eldest son [Y].

  reading from top to bottom we have:  in the first light – [X] sacrificing isaac, the raising of lazarus, and the good samaritan;  in the third light – the woman touching the hem of christ's garment, hagar and [Y], and jesus blessing the children;  in the fourth light – the conversion of saul and the prodigal son, in the sixth light – christ and the men in the tombs.

another religious reference comes when max is in the market looking for that day's newspaper, when a recitation from the quran can be heard in the background, which cites quran 2:140: "or do you say that [X] and [Y] and isaac and jacob and the descendants were jews or christians? say, 'are you more knowing or is allah?' and who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from allah? and allah is not unaware of what you do.

the house of [Y] (sometimes referred to as the tribe of [Y]) is a designation which members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds church) apply to the ancient "birthright" tribe of the house of israel ([X]) as it is described in the old testament, made up of the tribes of ephraim and manasseh.

 these modern [Y]ites claim, however, that many in their ranks are also of the tribe of manasseh, [Y]'s eldest son and a joint-recipient of the 'double portion' of [X]'s birthright blessing upon the heads of his grandsons.

much of the story of the house of [Y], according to latter-day saints, is reflected in ancient ancestral prophecies, including those made by the patriarch [X] and his son, [Y] of egypt (many of them now restored through revelation by the lds faith's founding prophet).

[X] went on to further elevate the status of the descendants of [Y]'s sons to that of full tribes in their own right (gen 41:50).

[Y] is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: the archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of [X]; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of israel:) even by the god of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of [Y], and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .

members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, who believe themselves predominantly to be of the ephraimite branch of the house of [Y], assert that revelations given of god to the prophet [Y] smith (jst gen 50), and as contained in the book of mormon (2 ne 3), bear witness that the patriarch [X]'s firstborn 'double portion' of both progeny and lands with which he blessed his son, [Y] of egypt (and his 'double portion'-inheriting grandsons ephraim and manasseh), included the additional 'land' portion of the whole of the american continent — to which (c.

the church teaches that the gathering of the descendants of ephraim and manasseh in the americas fulfills the prophecy of [X] that "[Y] is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall" (gen 49:22), wherein the enclosed "wall" of the water-filled "well" is understood to be an ocean-barrier of safety that separates lands.

 rachel was [X]'s divinely intended wife and could hypothetically have given birth to [Y] as [X]'s firstborn with rights of primogeniture.

 in this counterfactual, [X]'s favoring [Y]'s succession as the leader of the fledgling nation of israel would have been seen as perfectly normal and fitting, given the customs of the time.

 thus, there would have been no need for [X]'s family to be sent to egypt to unite with [Y].

in actuality, laban married [X] to leah first, causing leah's sons to precede [Y] in birth order, so that they felt justifiably outraged when their father seemed to violate societal norms by treating his second-youngest son as his heir, in preference to his older sons' natural and legal rights.

 in this way, laban can be seen as "seeking to uproot all", by attempting to sever the family tree of the patriarchs between [X] and [Y] before the children of israel could become more than a single small family.
