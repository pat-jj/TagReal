 the narrative is punctuated by a series of covenants with god, successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the covenant with noah) to a special relationship with one people alone (abraham and his descendants through [X] and [Y]).

 (the stories of [X] do not make up a coherent cycle of stories and function as a bridge between the cycles of abraham and [Y].

 [X] favored esau, and rebekah favored [Y].

 while esau was hunting, [Y], after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that [Y] became [X]'s primary heir and esau was left in an inferior position.

 thereafter, [X] sent [Y] into mesopotamia to take a wife of his mother's brother's house.

according to local tradition, the graves of [X] and rebekah, along with the graves of abraham and sarah and [Y] and leah, are in the cave of the patriarchs.

in the epistle to the hebrews, abraham's willingness to follow god's command to sacrifice [X] is used as an example of faith as is [X]'s action in blessing [Y] and esau with reference to the future promised by god to abraham.

 among [X]'s children was the follow-up israelite patriarch [Y], who is also venerated as an islamic prophet.

[X] is mentioned seventeen times by name in the quran, often with his father and his son, [Y].

 in a fuller description, when angels came to abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on sodom and gomorrah, his wife, sarah, "laughed, and we gave her good tidings of [X], and after [X] of (a grandson) [Y]" (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite abraham and sarah's old age.

 several verses speak of [X] as a "gift" to abraham (6: 84; 14: 49–50), and 24: 26–27 adds that god made "prophethood and the book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson [Y], and his prophetic great-grandson joseph.

elsewhere in the quran, [X] is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers abraham, [X] and [Y] (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); [Y]'s sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "abraham, ishmael and [X]", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "abraham, ishmael, [X], [Y] and the patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84).

 [X] and [Y] are mentioned as being bestowed upon abraham as gifts of god, who then worshipped god only and were righteous leaders in the way of god:

according to martin noth, a scholar of the hebrew bible, the narratives of [X] date back to an older cultural stage than that of the west-jordanian [Y].

 later, the descendants of [X]'s son [Y] were enslaved in egypt, and god commanded moses to lead the exodus from egypt.

 [Y] first appears in the book of genesis, where he is described as the son of [X] and rebecca, and the grandson of abraham, sarah and bethuel.

 according to the biblical account, he was the second-born of [X]'s children, the elder being [Y]'s fraternal twin brother, esau.

[Y] and his twin brother, esau, were born to [X] and rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when [X] was 60 years of age.

 moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: "and [X] loved esau, because he did eat of his venison: but rebecca loved [Y].

 it is suggested that she realized prophetically that [X]'s blessings would go to [Y], since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger.

 rebecca blessed [Y] and she quickly ordered [Y] to bring her two kid goats from their flock so that he could take esau's place in serving [X] and receiving his blessing.

 [Y] did as his mother instructed and, when he returned with the kids, rebecca made the savory meat that [X] loved.

disguised as esau, [Y] entered [X]'s room.

 [X] demanded that [Y] come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like esau's hairy skin.

 confused, [X] exclaimed, "the voice is [Y]'s voice, but the hands are the hands of esau!" still trying to get at the truth, [X] asked him directly, "art thou my very son esau?" and [Y] answered simply, "i am.

" [X] proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that [Y] gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him.

 as [Y] kissed his father, [X] smelled the clothes which belonged to esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was esau.

 [X] then blessed [Y] with the blessing that was meant for esau.

 the realization that he had been deceived shocked [X], yet he acknowledged that [Y] had received the blessings by adding, "indeed, he will be [or remain] blessed!" (27:33).

 having made [Y] a ruler over his brothers, [X] could only promise, "by your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck" (27:39–40).

although esau sold [Y] his own birthright, which was his blessing, for "red pottage," esau still hated [Y] for receiving his blessing that their father [X] unknowingly had given to him.

 he vowed to kill [Y] as soon as [X] died.

 she convinced [X] to send [Y] away by telling him that she despaired of his marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of canaan (as esau had done).

 after [X] sent [Y] away to find a wife, esau realized his own canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes and so he took a daughter of [X]'s half-brother, ishmael, as another wife.

 [Y] actually diverted himself to succoth and was not recorded as rejoining esau until, at machpelah, the two bury their father [X], who lived to be 180, and was 60 years older than they were.

 [Y] was finally reunited with his father [X] in mamre (outside hebron).

when [X] died at the age of 180, [Y] and esau buried him in the cave of the patriarchs, which abraham had purchased as a family burial plot.

 a conservative interpretation is that, at [X]'s burial, [Y] obtained the records of esau, who had been married 80 years prior, and incorporated them into his own family records, and that moses augmented and published them.

 in that case, since [X] was 60 when [Y] and essau were born and they had been married for 20 years, then [X] was 40 years old when he married rebecca (gen.

 in either case, [X] and rebecca were married for 20 years before [Y] and esau were born.

rashi explained that [X], when blessing [Y] instead of esau, smelled the heavenly scent of gan eden (paradise) when [Y] entered his room and, in contrast, perceived gehenna opening beneath esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by esau's show of piety.

in contrast to the judeo-christian view of [Y], one main difference is that the story of [Y]'s blessing, in which he deceives [X], is not accepted in islam.

 dever wrote in 2001: "after a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham, [X], or [Y] 'historical figures.

 according to rabbi jose bar hanina, each of the patriarchs instituted one prayer: abraham the morning, [X] the afternoon and [Y] the evening prayers.

 some claim that it originates from an aramaic word, de'avuhon or d'avinun, meaning 'of their/our forefathers', as the three prayers are said to have been invented by abraham, [X] and [Y].

[Y] was the eldest son of joseph abendana and brother to [X] abendana.

several years later, with his brother, [X], [Y] published the bible commentary miklal yofi by solomon ben melekh which included his own commentary, lekket shikchah (gleanings), on the pentateuch, the book of joshua, and part of the book of judges.

the biblical book of genesis speaks of the relationship between fraternal twins [Y] and esau, sons of [X] and rebecca.

 the story focuses on esau's loss of his birthright to [Y] and the conflict that ensued between their descendant nations because of [Y]'s deception of their aged and blind father, [X], in order to receive esau's birthright/blessing from [X].

this conflict was paralleled by the affection the parents had for their favored child: "[X], who had a taste for wild game, loved esau, but rebekah loved [Y].

 despite the deception on the part of [Y] and his mother to gain [X]'s patriarchal blessing, [Y]'s vocation as [X]'s legitimate heir in the continued founding of the jewish people is reaffirmed.

 [Y] brought [X] a dish of goat meat prepared by rebecca to taste like venison.

 she explains to [X] that she has sent [Y] to find a wife among her own people.

 [Y], having fled for his life, leaves behind the wealth of [X]'s flocks and land and tents in esau's hands.

 the next time [Y] and esau meet is at the burial of their father, [X], in hebron.

 [X] then refuses to take [Y]'s blessing back after learning he was tricked, and does not give this blessing to esau but, after esau begs, gives him an inferior blessing.

 exodus 13) that the god of abraham, [X] and [Y] gave the hebrews their "law" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and sabbaths.

 for example, in the 11th-century writings of [X] ben [Y] ha-cohen, lilith left adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the garden of eden after she had coupled with the archangel samael.

the mystical writing of two brothers [Y] and [X] hacohen, treatise on the left emanation, which predates the zohar by a few decades, states that samael and lilith are in the shape of an androgynous being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the throne of glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to adam and eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite.

", while  commands the believers of islam to "say: we believe in god and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto abraham and ishmael and [X] and [Y] and the tribes, and that which moses and jesus received, and which the prophets received from their lord.

the hebrew bible (christian old testament) describes a number of marriages, including those of [X], [Y] and samson.

in 1908 he married lena rubin, left kj, and was ordained as a rabbi by rabbi [X] [Y] reines while on his honeymoon in europe.

the term "b-spline" was coined by [X] [Y] schoenberg and is short for basis spline.

 an israelite could thus not criticize david’s selection of solomon to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — [X], [Y], judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

reading , "[Y] cooked food," ohr ha-chaim suggested that [Y] did so because he saw how effective esau's providing [X] with delicious meals had been in cementing [X]'s love for esau, and thus [Y] tried to emulate esau's success.

 in his heart, [X] had long known that esau could not carry on the burden of abraham and that, instead, he had to choose his quiet and complicated younger son [Y].

 plaut noted that [X] did not reprimand [Y].

noting that the name [Y] can mean "he will deceive" and that in , [Y]'s father [X] accused [Y] of acting "deceitfully" (, bemirmah), a word that derives from the same root as the adjective "crafty" (, arum) applied to the serpent in , karen armstrong argued that [Y]'s example makes clear that god does not choose one person over another because of the person's moral virtue.

 and [Y] charged his sons to bury him with his fathers in the cave of machpelah that abraham bought and where they buried abraham and sarah, [X] and rebekah, and where he buried leah.

 joseph told his brothers that he was dying, but god would surely remember them and bring them out of egypt to the land that god had sworn to abraham, [X], and [Y].

rabbi [X] taught in the name of rabbi joḥanan that [Y] did not die.

") rav naḥman objected that he must have died, for he was bewailed (as  reports) and embalmed (as  reports) and buried (as  reports)! rabbi [X] replied that rabbi joḥanan derived his position that [Y] still lives from , which says, "therefore fear not, o [Y], my servant, says the lord; neither be dismayed, o israel, for, lo, i will save you from afar and your seed from the land of their captivity.

 an israelite could thus not criticize david's selection of solomon to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — [X], [Y], judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

in the sixth reading (, ), [Y] set his sons and his wives on camels and headed out toward [X] and canaan with all the animals and wealth that he had collected in padan-aram.

 rabbi haninah taught that [X] sent [Y] away empty-handed.

 rabbi joshua, however, taught that [X] sent [Y] well provided, but esau arose and stripped him of all he had.

hezekiah taught that [Y] was 63 years old when [X] blessed him (as a baraita taught), and [Y] spent another 14 years secluded in the land of israel studying under eber and a further seven years working for the matriarchs.

 rabbi [X] noted that  reports that [Y] left beersheba in the south of the land of israel and went toward haran north of the land, and  reports that "he lighted upon the place" identified (in ) as bethel in the center of the land.

 rabbi [X] deduced that god rolled up the whole land of israel and put it under [Y], thus indicating that his descendants would easily conquer it.

rabbi judan said that [Y] declared that [X] blessed him with five blessings, and god correspondingly appeared five times to [Y] and blessed him (, , , , and ).

 and thus, in , [Y] "offered sacrifices to the god of his father [X]," and not to the god of abraham and [X].

 (and thus [Y] mentioned [X] then on going down to witness joseph's greatness.

in the sixth reading, god told [Y] that god would give [Y] and his descendants the land that god gave to abraham and [X].

 [Y] came to [X] at hebron, [X] died at the old age of 180, and esau and [Y] buried him.

reading [Y]'s beseeching god in , "o god of my father abraham, and god of my father [X]," a midrash asked whether esau (from whom [Y] sought god's protection) could not have made the same claim for god's favor.

 abraham delivered them to [X], [X] delivered them to [Y], [Y] delivered the mystery of the redemption to joseph, and joseph delivered the secret of the redemption to his brothers, as in , joseph told his brothers, "god will surely visit (, ) you.

reading , "and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day," rabbi [X] deduced that a scholar should not go out alone at night (for the man assaulted [Y] only during the night, and departed with the break of day).

rabbi judan said that [Y] declared that [X] blessed him with five blessings, and god correspondingly appeared five times to [Y] and blessed him (in , , , , and ).

 and thus, in , [Y] "offered sacrifices to the god of his father [X]," and not to the god of abraham and [X].

 (and thus [Y] mentioned [X] then on going down to witness joseph's greatness.

 when rebekah died, the people asked who would go out in front of her body, for abraham had died, [X] sat at home unable to see, [Y] had gone to paddan aram, and if esau went out in front of her, people would curse her for raising such a person as esau.

 god is the god of abraham, the god of [X], and the god of [Y] only.

” rabbi [X] taught that the city was called "kiryat ha’arba" — 'the city of four' — because it was the city of the four couples buried there: adam and eve, abraham and sarah, [X] and rebecca, and [Y] and leah.

expanding on , the pirke de-rabbi eliezer told that [Y] took his sons, grandsons, and wives, and went to kiryat arba to be near [X].

 [Y] found esau and his sons and wives there dwelling in [X]'s tents, so [Y] spread his tent apart from esau's.

 [X] rejoiced at seeing [Y].

 rabbi levi said that in the hour when [X] was dying, he left his cattle, possessions, and all that he had to his two sons, and therefore they both loved him, and thus  reports, "and esau and [Y] his sons buried him.

" the pirke de-rabbi eliezer told that after that, esau told [Y] to divide [X]'s holdings into two portions, and esau would choose first between the two portions as a right of being the older.

 perceiving that esau had his eye set on riches, [Y] divided the land of israel and the cave of machpelah in one part and all the rest of [X]'s holdings in the other part.

 ishmael told esau that the amorite and the canaanite were in the land, so esau should take the balance of [X]'s holdings, and [Y] would have nothing.

 so esau took [X]'s wealth and gave [Y] the land of israel and the cave of machpelah, and they wrote a perpetual deed between them.

 esau, [Y], and all [Y]'s children went to bury [X], as  reports, "esau, [Y], and his sons buried him," and they were all in the cave of machpelah sitting and weeping.

rashi read [Y]'s words in , "unless you have blessed me," to ask the angel to concede to [Y] the blessings with which [X] blessed [Y], and to which esau objected.

 [Y]," to mean that it shall no longer be said that [X]'s blessings came to [Y] through trickery (, ) and deceit, but with nobility and openness, and ultimately, god would reveal god's self to [Y] at bethel and change [Y]'s name, and there god would bless [Y], and the angel would be there, too.

 the angel then acknowledged [X]'s blessings as being [Y]'s.

[X] ben moses arama read the angel's request in  for [Y] to let him go as simply another way of asking [Y] why he was wasting his time detaining the angel, when he should have been busy preparing gifts for esau.

 [X] ben moses arama taught that [Y]'s request to know the angel's name meant that [Y] wanted to know who had the power to inflict such damage on his hip joint.

 the midrash taught that each of the righteous practiced a particular meritorious deed: abraham practiced circumcision, [X] practiced prayer, and [Y] practiced truth, as  says, “you will show truth to [Y].

 an israelite could thus not criticize david’s selection of solomon to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — [X], [Y], judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

a midrash asked why, in , [Y] "offered sacrifices to the god of his father [X]," and not to the god of abraham and [X].

 resh lakish said that [Y] offered sacrifices (in thanksgiving) for the covenant with the ancestors (which [X] had conveyed to [Y] with his blessing).

 one of them said that [Y] declared that as [X] had been eager for his food (for, as  reports, [X] loved esau because esau brought [X] venison), so [Y] was eager for his food (and thus was headed to egypt to avoid the famine).

 the other explained that as [X] had distinguished between his sons (as  reports, loving esau more than [Y]), so [Y] would distinguish among his sons (going to egypt for joseph's account alone).

 but then [Y] noted on reconsideration that [X] was responsible for only one soul, whereas [Y] was responsible for 70 souls.

 rabbi judan said that [Y] declared that [X] blessed him with five blessings, and god correspondingly appeared five times to [Y] and blessed him (in , , , , and ).

 (and thus, [Y] mentioned [X] then on going down to witness joseph's greatness.

 (and thus [Y] referred to the god of [X] instead of the god of [Y].

 (and thus [Y] referred to [X] to invoke the memory of abraham's sacrifice of [X] in  as if it had been carried out).

rabbi haggai said in rabbi [X]'s name that god's promise to [Y] in , "i will surely bring you up again," only applied if "joseph shall put his hand upon your eyes" — that is, take care of [Y] in life and in death.

 god favored abel over cain in ; [X] superseded ishmael in ; [Y] superseded esau in ; judah (fourth among [Y]'s sons, last of the original set born to leah) and joseph (eleventh in line) superseded their older brothers in ; perez superseded zerah in  and ; and ephraim superseded manasseh in .

 an israelite could thus not criticize david’s selection of solomon to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — [X], [Y], judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

 the midrash thus read joseph's question, "is your father well?" in  to allude to [Y], and joseph's reference in  to "the old man of whom you spoke" to allude to [X].

 god favored abel over cain in ; [X] superseded ishmael in ; [Y] superseded esau in ; judah (fourth among [Y]'s sons, last of the original set born to leah) and joseph (eleventh in line) superseded their older brothers in ; perez superseded zerah in  and ; and ephraim superseded manasseh in .

the house of [Y] (sometimes referred to as the tribe of [Y]) is a designation which members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds church) apply to the ancient "birthright" tribe of the house of israel ([X]) as it is described in the old testament, made up of the tribes of ephraim and manasseh.

 these modern [Y]ites claim, however, that many in their ranks are also of the tribe of manasseh, [Y]'s eldest son and a joint-recipient of the 'double portion' of [X]'s birthright blessing upon the heads of his grandsons.

much of the story of the house of [Y], according to latter-day saints, is reflected in ancient ancestral prophecies, including those made by the patriarch [X] and his son, [Y] of egypt (many of them now restored through revelation by the lds faith's founding prophet).

[X] went on to further elevate the status of the descendants of [Y]'s sons to that of full tribes in their own right (gen 41:50).

[Y] is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: the archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of [X]; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of israel:) even by the god of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of [Y], and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .

members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, who believe themselves predominantly to be of the ephraimite branch of the house of [Y], assert that revelations given of god to the prophet [Y] smith (jst gen 50), and as contained in the book of mormon (2 ne 3), bear witness that the patriarch [X]'s firstborn 'double portion' of both progeny and lands with which he blessed his son, [Y] of egypt (and his 'double portion'-inheriting grandsons ephraim and manasseh), included the additional 'land' portion of the whole of the american continent — to which (c.

 rachel was [X]'s divinely intended wife and could hypothetically have given birth to [Y] as [X]'s firstborn with rights of primogeniture.

 in this counterfactual, [X]'s favoring [Y]'s succession as the leader of the fledgling nation of israel would have been seen as perfectly normal and fitting, given the customs of the time.

 thus, there would have been no need for [X]'s family to be sent to egypt to unite with [Y].

in actuality, laban married [X] to leah first, causing leah's sons to precede [Y] in birth order, so that they felt justifiably outraged when their father seemed to violate societal norms by treating his second-youngest son as his heir, in preference to his older sons' natural and legal rights.

 in this way, laban can be seen as "seeking to uproot all", by attempting to sever the family tree of the patriarchs between [X] and [Y] before the children of israel could become more than a single small family.

 most authorities maintain that the former depended directly upon the latter; and their chief argument is based on the passage on [Y], part of which is contained also in [X]'s blessing.

 “the [X] and [Y] stories as analogies.

 "[Y]us' portrait of [X].

 the parashah tells of [X]'s request for burial in canaan, [X]'s blessing of [Y]'s sons ephraim and manasseh, [X]'s blessing of his sons, [X]'s death and burial, and [Y]'s death.

 when [X]'s death drew near, he called his son [Y] and asked him to put his hand under [X]'s thigh and swear not to bury him in egypt, but to bury him with his father and grandfather.

 [Y] agreed, but [X] insisted that he swear to, and so he did, and [X] bowed.

 [X] sat up and told [Y] that god appeared to him at luz, blessed him, and told him that god would multiply his descendants and give them that land forever.

 [X] adopted [Y]'s sons as his own and granted them inheritance with his own sons.

 [X] saw [Y]'s sons and asked who they were, and [Y] told him that they were the sons whom god had given him in egypt, so [X] asked [Y] to bring them near so that he might bless them.

in the second reading, [X]'s sight had dimmed with age, so [Y] brought his sons near, and [X] kissed them and embraced them.

 [X] told [Y] that he had not thought to see his face, and now god had let him see his children, as well.

 [Y] took them from between his knees, bowed deeply, and brought them to [X], with ephraim in his right hand toward [X]'s left hand, and manasseh in his left hand toward [X]'s right hand.

in the third reading, it displeased [Y] that [X] laid his right hand on ephraim, and he lifted [X]'s right hand to move it to manasseh the firstborn, but [X] refused, saying that manasseh would also become a great people, but his younger brother would be greater.

 [X] told [Y] that he was dying, but god would be with him and bring him back to the land of his fathers, and [X] had given him a portion (shechem) above his brothers, which he took from the amorites with his sword and bow.

in the continuation of the reading, [X] called [Y] a fruitful vine by a fountain whose branches ran over the wall, archers shot at him, but his bow remained firm; [X] blessed him with blessings of heaven above and the deep below, blessings of the breasts and womb, and mighty blessings on the head of the prince among his brethren.

 [Y] commanded the physicians to embalm [X], and they did so over the next 40 days, and the egyptians wept for [X] 70 days.

 thereafter, [Y] asked pharaoh's courtiers to tell pharaoh that [X] had made [Y] swear to bury him in the land of canaan and ask that he might go up, bury his father, and return.

 with [X]'s death, [Y]'s brothers grew concerned that [Y] would repay them for the evil that they had done, and they sent [Y] a message that [X] had commanded him to forgive them.

 [Y] told his brothers that he was dying, but god would surely remember them and bring them out of egypt to the land that god had sworn to abraham, isaac, and [X].

reading , "[X] lived in the land of egypt seventeen years," the midrash hagadol explained that these correspond to the 17 years that [Y] lived in his father’s home.

 thus, for the 17 years that [X] sustained [Y], [Y] in turn sustained [X] for the same period, measure for measure.

reading the words of , "and he called his son [Y]," a midrash asked why [X] did not call reuben or judah, as reuben was the firstborn and judah was king.

 yet [X] disregarded them and called [Y], because [Y] had the means of fulfilling [X]'s wishes.

rabbi eliezer taught that in the hour of [X]'s death, he called to his son [Y], and adjured him to swear to [X] by the covenant of circumcision that [Y] would take [X] up to the burial-place of his fathers in the cave of machpelah.

a midrash asked why [X] told [Y] in , "bury me not, i pray, in egypt.

rabbi elazar read  to report that [X] bowed to [Y] because [Y] was in power.

 the gemara thus viewed [Y] as the fox, to whom, in his day, even the senior [X] bowed down.

 then [X] came and prayed, and illness came into being, as  reports, "and one told [Y], ‘behold, your father is sick'" (reporting sickness for the first time in the torah).

 in , [X] blessed [Y]'s descendants to grow like fishes.

interpreting , rabbi jose's nephew taught that as he was dying, [X] gave his sons three signs by which his descendants might recognize the true redeemer: (1) he would come using, as [X] did, the word "i" (, anoki), (2) he would appoint elders for the people, and (3) he would say to the people, "god will remember you," as [Y] did in ).

 rav papa asked abaye whether perhaps [X] merely gave [Y] an extra palm tree.

 abaye answered that  demonstrated that [X] intended that [Y] would get two full portions "even as reuben and simeon.

" rabbi Ḥelbo asked rabbi samuel bar naḥmani why [X] took the firstborn's birthright from reuben and gave it to [Y].

 similarly, because [Y] cared for [X], [X] chose to give to [Y].

a midrash taught that the intent of [X]'s blessing of [Y] in , "[Y] is a fruitful vine (, bein porat yoseif)," related to [Y]'s interpretation of pharaoh's dreams in .

" and this was the intent of [X]'s blessing of [Y] in , "[Y] is a fruitful vine (, bein porat yoseif)," which the midrash taught one should read as, "[Y] was among the cows (, bein ha-parot yoseif).

 later, in , when [Y] related to pharaoh that [X] had made [Y] swear to bury him in the land of israel, pharaoh asked [Y] to seek to be released from the oath.

 rabbi tanḥuma observed that [Y]'s motive was noble, for [Y] reasoned that formerly [X] had placed [Y] above judah, who was a king, and above reuben, who was the firstborn, but after [X]'s death, it would not be right for [Y] to sit above them.

rabban simeon ben gamliel read  to report that [Y]'s brothers fabricated [X]'s request that [Y] forgive them in order to preserve peace in the family.

rabbi jose deduced from [Y]'s talk of providing in  that when [X] died, the famine returned.

 abraham delivered them to isaac, isaac delivered them to [X], [X] delivered the mystery of the redemption to [Y], and [Y] delivered the secret of the redemption to his brothers, as in , [Y] told his brothers, "god will surely visit (, pakod yifkod) you.

rav judah asked in the name of rav why [Y] referred to himself as "bones" during his lifetime (in ), and explained that it was because he did not protect his father's honor when in  his brothers called [X] "your servant our father" and [Y] failed to protest.

 to support the proposition that assuming airs of authority shortens one's life, the gemara cited the teaching of rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina that [Y] died (as  reports, at the age of 110) before his brothers because he assumed airs of authority (when in  and  he repeatedly allowed his brothers to describe his father [X] as "your servant").

james kugel read  to tell that [X] legally adopted [Y]'s sons ephraim and manasseh as his own, making them coequal heirs with [X]'s other sons.

 thus, while [Y] formerly was entitled to one-twelfth of [X]'s estate, after , [X] replaced [Y]'s single share with the two shares of ephraim and manasseh, giving [Y] in effect a double portion.

 when [Y] was 17, he fed the flock with his brothers, and he brought [X] an evil report about his brothers.

 because [Y] was the son of [X]'s old age, [X] loved him more than his other children, and [X] made him a coat of many colors, which caused [Y]'s brothers to hate him.

 he told his brothers another dream, in which the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down to him, and when he told his father, [X] rebuked him, asking whether he, [Y]'s mother, and his brothers would bow down to [Y].

 [Y]'s brothers envied him, but [X] kept what he said in mind.

in the second reading (, aliyah), when the brothers went to feed the flock in shechem, [X] sent [Y] to see whether all was well with them.

 they took [Y]'s coat of many colors, dipped it in goat's blood, and sent it to [X] to identify.

 the gemara explained that the verse indicates that [Y] was worthy of having 12 tribes descend from him, as they did from his father [X].

rava bar mehasia said in the name of rav hama bar goria in rav's name that a man should never single out one son among his other sons, for on account of the small weight of silk that [X] gave [Y] more than he gave his other sons (as reported in ), his brothers became jealous of [Y] and the matter resulted in the israelites' descent into egypt.

noting that in  [X] asked [Y], "shall i and your mother .

 indeed come," when [Y]'s mother rachel was then dead, rabbi levi said in the name of rabbi hama ben haninah that [X] believed that resurrection would take place in his days.

 but rabbi levi taught that [X] did not know that [Y]'s dream in fact applied to bilhah, rachel's handmaid, who had brought [Y] up like a mother.

the pirke de-rabbi eliezer taught that [Y] saw the sons of [X]'s concubines eating the flesh of roes and sheep while they were still alive and reported on them to [X].

 [X] told [Y] that he had waited many days without hearing of the welfare of [Y]'s brethren, and of the welfare of the flock, and thus, as reported in  [X] asked [Y], "go now, see whether it be well with your brethren, and well with the flock.

reading  "and he said to him: ‘here am i,'" rabbi hama bar rabbi hanina said that after [Y] went missing, [X] was ever mindful of [Y] words and [X]'s insides were torn up about them.

 for [X] realized that [Y] had known that his brothers hated him, and yet he answered [X]: ‘here am i.

in contrast, another midrash faulted judah for not calling on the brothers to return [Y] to [X].

 the midrash told that when [Y]'s brothers tried to comfort [X] and he refused to be comforted, they told [X] that judah was responsible.

 similarly, [X]'s other sons were grown up and under their father's control, but [Y] was young and away from his father's supervision.

 donald redford and other scholars following him suspected that behind the [Y] story stood an altogether invented egyptian or canaanite tale that was popular on its own before an editor changed the main characters to [X] and his sons.

 in support of this theory, scholars have pointed to the description of [Y] (rather than benjamin) in  as if he were [X]'s youngest son, [Y]'s and [X]'s references to [Y]'s mother (as if rachel were still alive) in [Y]'s prophetic dream in  and the role of the oldest brother reuben intervening for [Y] in   and  scholars theorize that when the editor first mechanically put reuben in the role of the oldest, but as the tribe of reuben had virtually disappeared and the audience for the story were principally descendants of judah, judah was given the role of spokesman and hero in the end.

 “the [X] and [Y] stories as analogies.

 in the parashah, judah pleads on behalf of his brother benjamin, [Y] reveals himself to his brothers, [X] comes down to egypt, and [Y]'s administration of egypt saves lives but transforms all the egyptians into bondmen.

in the first reading (, aliyah), judah approached [Y], whom he likened to pharaoh, and recounted how [Y] had asked the 10 brothers whether they had a father or brother, and they had told him that they had a father who was an old man ([X]), and a child of his old age who was a little one (benjamin), whose brother was dead, who alone was left of his mother (rachel), and whose father loved him.

 the brothers went to their father [X] in canaan and told him that [Y] was still alive and ruled over egypt, but he did not believe them.

 they told him what [Y] had said, and when [X] saw the wagons that [Y] had sent, [X] revived.

in the long fifth reading (, aliyah), [X] said that he would go to see [Y] before he died.

rabbi benjamin bar japhet in the name of rabbi elazar deduced from  that [Y] sent [X] aged wine, which the rabbi reported pleases the elderly.

a midrash told that when [Y] was young, he used to study torah with [X].

 when [Y]'s brothers told [X] in  that [Y] was still alive, [X] did not believe them, but he recalled the subject that [X] and [Y] had been studying when they last studied together: the passage on the beheaded heifer (, egla arufa) in .

 [X] told the brothers that if [Y] gave them a sign of which subject [Y] and [X] had last studied together, then [X] would believe them.

 [Y] too had remembered what subject they had been studying, so (as  reports) he sent [X] wagons (, agalot) so that [X] might know that the gift came from him.

 in support of this theory, scholars have pointed to the description of [Y] (rather than benjamin) in  as if he were [X]'s youngest son, [Y]'s and [X]'s references to [Y]'s mother (as if rachel were still alive) in [Y]'s prophetic dream in , and the role of the oldest brother reuben intervening for [Y] in , , and .

 “the [X] and [Y] stories as analogies.

 ten of [Y]'s brothers went down to egypt, but [X] kept benjamin behind, so that no harm would befall him.

 they went home and told [X] what had happened, and [X] accused them of bereaving him of his children, first [Y] and now simeon, and told them that they would not take benjamin away.

 reuben answered that [X] could kill reuben's two sons if reuben failed to bring benjamin back, but [X] insisted that his son would not go down with them, for [Y] was dead and only benjamin was left, and if harm befall benjamin then it would be the death of [X].

" and this was the intent of [X]'s blessing of [Y] in , "[Y] is a fruitful vine" (, bein porat yoseif), which the midrash taught one should read as, "[Y] was among the cows" (, bein ha-parot yoseif).

 later, in , when [Y] related to pharaoh that [X] had made [Y] swear to bury him in the land of israel, pharaoh asked [Y] to seek to be released from the oath.

interpreting [X]'s question to his sons in , "why do you look one on another?", a midrash taught that when [X] told them to go down to egypt, they looked at one another, thinking of [Y].

 the midrash thus read [Y]'s question, "is your father well?" in  to allude to [X], and [Y]'s reference in  to "the old man of whom you spoke" to allude to isaac.

 to support the proposition that assuming airs of authority shortens one's life, the gemara cited the teaching of rabbi hama bar hanina that [Y] died (as  reports, at the age of 110) before his brothers because he assumed airs of authority (when in  and  he repeatedly allowed his brothers to describe his father [X] as "your servant").

a midrash told that when in  the steward found [Y]'s cup in benjamin's belongings, his brothers beat benjamin on his shoulders, calling him a thief and the son of a thief, and saying that he had shamed them as rachel had shamed [X] when she stole laban's idols in .

 pharaoh – not [Y] – invited [X] and his family to settle in egypt – not just goshen.

john kselman noted that as in the [X] cycle that precedes it, the [Y] narrative begins with the deception of a father by his offspring through an article of clothing; the deception leads to the separation of brothers for 20 years; and the climax of the story comes with the reconciliation of estranged brothers and the abatement of family strife.

 god favored abel over cain in ; isaac superseded ishmael in ; [X] superseded esau in ; judah (fourth among [X]'s sons, last of the original set born to leah) and [Y] (eleventh in line) superseded their older brothers in ; perez superseded zerah in  and ; and ephraim superseded manasseh in .

 an israelite could thus not criticize david’s selection of solomon to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel – isaac, [X], judah, [Y], perez, and ephraim – since the inception of the covenant.

 its theological relevance is, among other elements, in that [Y] is called "king of the people" "foster father" or – more literally – "nourisher of egyptians" and "savior", while there occurred many times the phrases "the god of [Y]" and "[Y] remembering [X]", emphasizing the ancestral role of his forefathers and not to have since lent support to different traditions.

 in [Y] and aseneth, [Y] is again referred as "king" (basileus), "giver of grain" (sinodotēs) and "savior" (sōter), in the same line of text (25:6), whereas the central theme of the testament of the twelve patriarchs is "[Y] remembering [X]", "while recounting the temptation by the wife of potiphar".

 what made them believe was the sign of god's visitation that god communicated to them through a tradition from [X], which [X] handed down to [Y], [Y] to his brothers, and asher, the son of [X], handed down to his daughter serah, who was still alive at the time of moses and aaron.
