Development of drug treatments for neurofibromatosis type vestibular PURPOSE OF REVIEW : To review the discoveries in molecular pathophysiology contributing to the development of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- - associated vestibular [Y] and the recent experiences with drug therapies for these tumors .

RECENT FINDINGS : Increased insight into the complex pathways that underlie both the genetic syndrome of [X] and the specific pathogenesis of vestibular [Y] has highlighted multiple potential therapeutic targets .

There is cause for enthusiasm based on recent results with antiangiogenesis therapy in select patients with [X] and progressive vestibular [Y] ; however , awareness of the notable risks and limitations of therapies currently in development is required .

Phase II trial of lapatinib in adult and pediatric patients with This single-institution phase II study was performed to estimate the response rate to lapatinib in neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- patients with progressive vestibular [Y] -LRB- VS -RRB- .

Exon scanning for mutation of the [X] gene in [Y] .

Neurofibromatosis antisense oligodeoxynucleotides induce reversible inhibition Mutations in the neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene are the predominant cause in the development of sporadic [Y] and are also involved in the pathogenesis of meningiomas and ependymomas .

In patients with vestibular [Y] -LRB- VSs -RRB- or identified [X] mutations , the mild phenotype was defined as < other intracranial tumors and < or = spinal tumors , and the severe phenotype as either > or = other intracranial tumors of > spinal tumors .

Although no mutation was observed in a small set of meningiomas and [Y] , alteration of these new genes should now be searched in other tumors with frequent allelic losses on chromosome not associated with [X] mutation .

[Y] and meningiomas occur as multiple tumors in sufferers of neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- and as solitary tumors in the general population due to the inactivation of a gene at chromosome .

Individuals affected with [X] develop [Y] at an increased frequency .

The gene for [X] , a syndrome typically associated with vestibular [Y] and meningiomas , is homologous with a family of genes whose members appear to play an important role in bridging the cell membrane with the intracellular cytoskeleton , including moesin , ezrin , radixin , and protein .

Recent mutation analyses have revealed that the [X] tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated not only in vestibular [Y] and meningiomas from [X] patients , but also in their sporadic counterparts , which represent approximately one-third of all human brain tumors .

We found three inactivating mutations of the [X] gene in [Y] .

These results confirm the role of [X] in pathogenesis of [Y] , but do not define its significance in the genesis of the other neuroectodermal tumors studied .

How the absence of the [X] protein may lead to the development of [Y] and meningiomas , which are the major manifestations of [X] in patients , is not clear at present .

Germ-line mutations in the neurofibromatosis gene : correlations with disease Neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- features bilateral vestibular [Y] , other benign neural tumors , and cataracts .

Although most [Y] are sporadic , they are seen in approximately % of individuals with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- , an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an incidence of live births .

It is believed to act as a tumor suppressor gene based on the high frequency of loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- on this autosome in both sporadic and [X] associated [Y] and meningiomas and the identification of inactivating mutation in [X] patients .

In this study we examined [Y] including sporadic [Y] -LRB- of which are vestibular [Y] -RRB- and [Y] obtained from [X] patients , for mutations in of the coding exons of the [X] gene .

These results support the hypothesis that loss of function of [X] is a frequent and fundamental event in the genesis of [Y] .

Deletion studies in sporadic and [X] associated [Y] and meningiomas , and the presence of inactivating mutations in [X] in patients suggest that it acts as a tumor suppressor gene .

Neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by bilateral vestibular [Y] and other nonmalignant tumors of the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves .

Mutations in the neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- tumor suppressor gene on chromosome cause a clinically variable autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by bilateral vestibular [Y] -LRB- VSs -RRB- , other nervous system tumors , and early onset lenticular cataracts .

-LSB- A new tumor suppressor gene responsible for type neurofibromatosis is Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disease which predisposes to multiple [Y] , meningiomas and to a lesser extent , to ependymomas .

Analysis of tumoral DNA from sporadic [Y] and meningiomas demonstrates complete loss of function in many cases , providing evidence that the [X] gene acts as tumor suppressor gene .

Multiple [Y] in a single patient are most often seen in neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- , but several recent reports suggest that schwannomatosis may also be a distinct clinical entity .

We studied the clinical , radiographic , and pathologic features of patients with multiple [Y] who did not have vestibular [Y] diagnostic of [X] .

We studied the clinical , radiographic , and pathologic features of patients with multiple [Y] who did not have vestibular [Y] diagnostic of [X] .

Frequency and distribution of [X] mutations in [Y] .

Sporadic and inherited [Y] were scanned for the nature , frequency , and distribution of mutations in the [X] locus encoding the [X] tumor suppressor protein on .

The data support the `` two-hit '' tumor suppressor model for formation of [Y] and indicate that loss of [X] function can be achieved by truncation at various locations in the protein .

Advances can be attributed to several fields , but the most important contributions have arisen from the identification of the genes responsible for the dominant inheritance of neurofibromatosis types -LRB- NF1 -RRB- and -LRB- [X] -RRB- and the development of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement for the early anatomic confirmation of the pathognomonic , bilateral vestibular [Y] in [X] .

The authors suggest that advising young [X] patients to wait until complications develop , especially hearing loss , before diagnosing and operating for bilateral eighth nerve [Y] may not always be in the best interest of the patient .

Somatic [X] gene mutations in familial and non-familial vestibular [Y] .

Vestibular [Y] occurs both as a sporadic tumour and in the dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

A further vestibular [Y] were investigated for [X] mutations only .

Somatic [X] gene mutations were detected in non-familial vestibular [Y] and in one of the [X] vestibular [Y] .

These results suggest that somatic mutations of the [X] tumour suppressor gene are a critical step in the pathogenesis of both familial and non-familial vestibular [Y] and that the mechanism of tumourigenesis complies with a ` two-hit ' mutation model .

Alternative splicing of the [X] gene and its mutation analysis of breast and To investigate a potential role of [X] , the gene responsible for hereditary bilateral acoustic [Y] , during carcinogenesis of non-neurogenic tissues , we screened somatic mutations of [X] in breast cancers and colorectal carcinomas by an RNase protection assay coupled with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction -LRB- RT-PCR -RRB- .

Mutational spectrum in the neurofibromatosis type gene in sporadic and familial Using a heteroduplex approach and direct sequencing , we have completed the screening of approximately % of the neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- - coding sequence of DNA extracted from [Y] from [X] patients and from patients with sporadic [Y] .

Because there have been only a few studies of the [X] gene on central nervous system tumors other than vestibular [Y] , we investigated the potential role of [X] as a tumor suppressor gene in a group of sporadic meningiomas and astrocytomas .

[X] , formerly classified as central neurofibromatosis , is characterized by bilateral vestibular [Y] , previously termed `` acoustic neuromas '' , and is much less common than NF1 .

We describe an male with [X] who had bilateral vestibular [Y] and multiple cutaneous PSs , and a history of abdominal pain .

Neurofibromas in NF1 and [Y] in [X] or schwannomatosis are defined by distinctive molecular hits .

This mechanism could explain the clinical observation that [X] patients suffer from higher incidences of slowly recovering facial nerve paralysis after vestibular [Y] surgery .

Although biallelic mutations of SMARCB1 or LZTR1 have been detected in the tumours of patients with schwannomatosis , the classical two-hit model of tumorigenesis is insufficient to account for [Y] growth , since [X] is also frequently inactivated in these tumours .

Increased growth rate of vestibular [Y] after resection of contralateral Surgical management of bilateral vestibular [Y] -LRB- VS -RRB- in neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is often difficult , especially when both tumors threaten the brainstem .

OBJECTIVES : To discuss our management strategy of vestibular [Y] in patients with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

The characteristic and diagnostic finding of [X] is bilateral vestibular nerve [Y] -LRB- acoustic neuromas -RRB- .

Deficiency of the tumor suppressor protein [X] leads to the development of benign tumors of the nervous system such as [Y] , ependymomas and meningiomas .

The [X] gene is commonly biallelically inactivated in both [Y] and meningiomas .

Lastly , depletion of DCAF1 inhibits the hyperproliferation of [Y] cells isolated from [X] patients and suppresses the oncogenic potential of Merlin-deficient tumor cell lines .

CONCLUSIONS : Cochleovestibular [Y] in [X] are aggressive neoplasms ; they are often multicentric and demonstrate a propensity to involve the labyrinth .

Vestibular [Y] are histopathologically benign tumors arising from the Schwann cell sheath surrounding the vestibular branch of cranial nerve VIII and are related to the [X] gene and its product [X] .

Vestibular [Y] are histopathologically benign tumors arising from the Schwann cell sheath surrounding the vestibular branch of cranial nerve VIII and are related to the [X] gene and its product [X] .

Thus , deficiencies in both [X] genes lead to vestibular [Y] development .

Biallelic [X] gene inactivation results in the development of central nervous system tumors , including [Y] , meningiomas , ependymomas , and astrocytomas .

In [X] , surgical treatment remains a cornerstone of management for symptomatic progressive vestibular [Y] , meningiomas , and spinal tumors .

[X] patients suffer from multiple genetically well-defined tumours , [Y] are most frequent among those .

Contribution of persistent C-Jun N-terminal kinase activity to the survival of Vestibular [Y] -LRB- VSs -RRB- result from inactivating mutations in the [X] tumor suppressor gene .

The co-existence of meningioma and [Y] as distinct histologic components within the same tumor has been described in neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- , but the co-existence of both tumors without evidence of [X] is much rarer .

Pregnancy-related [Y] progression and complications in von OBJECTIVE : We studied the reciprocal effect of pregnancy and von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease by analyzing the influence of pregnancy on [X] disease-related lesions and [X] disease on pregnancy outcome .

We recommend intensified surveillance of patients with [X] disease , especially of cerebellar [Y] during preconception care and pregnancy .

Early microsurgical treatment for spinal [Y] improves outcome in BACKGROUND : Spinal [Y] -LRB- HB -RRB- are rare , histologically benign , highly vascularized tumors often associated with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease .

Pazopanib therapy for cerebellar [Y] in von Hippel-Lindau disease : von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease is a genetically acquired multisystem tumor syndrome of the viscera and central nervous system -LRB- CNS -RRB- .

Evolution of a juxtapapillary von Hippel-Lindau tumour examined by optical PURPOSE : The aim was to report the evolution of a case of von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- juxtapapillary retinal capillary [Y] -LRB- RCH -RRB- by optical coherence tomography -LRB- OCT3 -RRB- .

CASE REPORT : The progress of a man suffering from [X] disease with a juxtapapillary [Y] and a small peripheral lesion was followed for months with fundus photographs and OCT of the optic nerve head using the optic nerve head rim volume , ranging from to mm -LRB- -RRB- .

In addition extraparaganglial tumors are frequent and include medullary thyroid carcinoma in MEN2 or renal cancer or neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer as well as [Y] of the retina and the central nervous system in [X] .

We present an unusual case of von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease that had adrenal and cerebellar [Y] with multiple renal cysts , and a review of the literature .

Based on this , the patient was screened for possible features of [X] , which revealed cerebellar [Y] and multiple renal cysts with angiomatous lesion .

He had a history of a previous surgical procedure for excisions of cervical spine [Y] years prior He had a family history of von-Hippel Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease , and a [X] mutation was identified .

A mutation at IVS1 + of the von Hippel-Lindau gene resulting in intron BACKGROUND : Von Hippel-Lindau disease -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing the patient to a variety of malignant and benign neoplasms , most frequently [Y] , renal cell carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , and pancreatic tumors .

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by renal cysts , retinal angiomas , central nervous system [Y] , and pancreatic cysts .

In addition , recent advances in the molecular genetics of this disorder are providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of tumourigenesis in [X] disease and in more common nonfamilial neoplasms such as clear cell renal carcinoma and central nervous system [Y] .

[X] is a rare tumor syndrome characterized by certain types of nervous system tumors -LRB- cerebellar and spinal [Y] as well as retinal angiomas -RRB- , in conjunction with bilateral renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas .

In addition , somatic Inactivation of the [X] gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and [Y] .

Renal cell carcinomas , [Y] , and pheochromocytomas , either VHL-related or sporadic , demonstrated positive staining for the [X] protein , which suggests that the antibody also recognizes the mutated [X] protein .

Due to recurrent [Y] , a29-year-old patient without familial history of [X] disease was diagnosed to be at risk for the disease .

Localization of expression by in situ Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- tumour suppressor gene is responsible not only for [X] disease , but also for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar [Y] .

Germline mutations in [X] patients , as well as somatic mutations in different tumors , including [Y] , have been identified , its ability to act as a tumor suppressor in vivo has been confirmed , and interaction with transcription factors Elongin B and C leading to inhibition of transcriptional elongation has been demonstrated .

The mechanism underlying neovascularization and cyst formation in [Y] and how this is linked to inactivation of the [X] tumor suppressor gene is not known .

It is believed that inactivation of both alleles of [X] tumor suppressor gene is essential in the tumorigenic processes in [Y] associated with [X] disease .

Here , we analyzed cases of primary sporadic [Y] for somatic mutations of [X] gene with single strand conformational polymorphism analyses of the tumor DNAs .

Our results suggest that mutations of [X] tumor suppressor gene are involved in the development of at least % of sporadic central nervous system [Y] .

Chromosome allele loss was found in four tumour types -LRB- RCC , [Y] , phaeochromocytoma and pancreatic tumour -RRB- suggesting a common mechanism of tumourigenesis in all types of tumour in [X] disease .

In the patient with the chemodectoma , a cerebellar [Y] became manifest yr after his initial diagnosis with pheochromocytoma , leading only then to a clinical diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Mutations in the [X] tumor suppressor gene and associated lesions in families von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to retinal , cerebellar and spinal [Y] , renal cell carcinoma -LRB- RCC -RRB- , pheochromocytoma and pancreatic tumors .

The current study is the first to describe a case of [X] disease with lateral ventricular [Y] and subsequent pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , bilateral renal cysts and renal cell carcinoma .

Von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with a predisposition to develop a wide variety of lesions : retinal , cerebellar , spinal and medullar [Y] , renal cell carcinomas , phaeochromocytomas , and renal , pancreatic and epididymal cysts are the most frequent manifestations of the disease .

Third , phenotypically , we observed that , in our population of East Asian patients with [X] syndrome , the incidence of retinal capillary [Y] was lower , whereas the incidence of renal cell carcinoma was higher .

Autocrine/Paracrine Erythropoietin Signaling Associated With Symptomatic von INTRODUCTION : Von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease is an autosomal dominant neoplastic disorder leading to formation of multiple central nervous system [Y] -LRB- HBs -RRB- .

Furthermore , genetic testing for [X] is indicated in some individuals with seemingly sporadic VHL-related tumor types , as < / = % of pheochromocytoma or early-onset renal cell carcinoma and < / = % of CNS [Y] harbor germline [X] mutations without a family history or additional features of [X] disease .

[X] disease is characterized by malignant and benign tumors in a few specific tissues , including ccRCC , [Y] and pheochromocytoma .

Central nervous system -LRB- CNS -RRB- manifestations of [X] include craniospinal [Y] and endolymphatic sac tumors -LRB- ELSTs -RRB- .

Although early sign/symptom formation is the primary indication for resection of craniospinal [Y] , radiographic discovery -LRB- asymptomatic and symptomatic -RRB- of ELSTs can be an indication for resection of ELSTs in [X] patients .

Bulbar dysfunction and aspiration pneumonia due to a brainstem [Y] : A woman with a history of von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease , a rare inherited neoplasia syndrome , presented acutely to hospital with a productive cough , symptoms of respiratory tract infection and odynophagia -LRB- painful swallowing -RRB- .

The aim of this study was to explore the value of OCTA in imaging retinal [Y] and monitoring laser treatment in patients with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease .

OCTA may help to distinguish [Y] and other lesions in [X] disease , especially after treatment and allows the differentiation from harmless non-vascular lesions in questionable cases .

Loss of Quiescence in von Hippel-Lindau [Y] is Associated with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- patients develop multiple central nervous system [Y] -LRB- HB -RRB- .

In [X] patients , we resected quiescent [Y] -LRB- Q-HB -RRB- that were en-route during surgical access to symptomatic [Y] -LRB- S-HB -RRB- , for matched tumor analysis .

Concomitant presence of [X] disease is observed in less than half of the patients with purely extradural spinal nerve root [Y] .

[X] loss-of-function mutations result in organ-specific tumors , such as [Y] of the central nervous system and renal cell carcinoma , both untreatable with conventional chemotherapies .

Patients with von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- [X] -RRB- disease as well as sporadic [Y] were included .

We showed that [X] is required for cell survival in medullary -LRB- [Y] -RRB- but not papillary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- PTC -RRB- cells .

In only of the sporadic [Y] we were able to detect a [X] mutation .

LOH spanning the [X] gene region was evident in [Y] , but in contrast to previous data from MPNSTs , it was absent at the TP53 , CDKN2A and RB1 gene loci .

[X] manifests as a heritable susceptibility to tumours of neural tissue mainly located in the skin -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and pigmented skin lesions .

-LSB- -RSB- - Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in children with The objective of this study was to investigate the predictive value of -LSB- -RSB- - fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography -LRB- FDG-PET -RRB- in detecting malignant transformation of plexiform [Y] in children with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

An electronic search of the medical records was performed to determine patients with [X] who had undergone FDG-PET for plexiform [Y] between and .

Identification of the genes that are mutated in genetic diseases characterized by the development of either [Y] and MPNSTs -LSB- neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- -RSB- or schwannomas -LSB- neurofibromatosis type -LRB- NF2 -RRB- , schwannomatosis and Carney complex type -RSB- has greatly advanced our understanding of these mechanisms .

emission tomography -LRB- FDG-PET -RRB- evaluation of BACKGROUND : Individuals with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- are at risk for developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors -LRB- MPNST -RRB- , which frequently arise in preexisting plexiform [Y] -LRB- PN -RRB- .

Imaging confirmed cerebral vacuolisation changes seen in [X] and a left facial plexiform [Y] involving the parotid gland .

Bone mineral metabolism in patients with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- von The neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is characterized by specific cutaneous features -LRB- [Y] , `` cafe-au-lait '' spots of the skin -RRB- and alterations of several tissue -LRB- nervous , vascular -RRB- and bone deformities , such as scoliosis , congenital pseudoarthrosis and bone dysplasia of tibia .

Clinical characteristics predicting internal [Y] in children with OBJECTIVE : To identify clinical characteristics associated with internal [Y] in children with [X] , as a means of ensuring the early identification of patients at high risk for malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors developed from preexisting internal [Y] .

CONCLUSIONS : Several easily recognizable clinical characteristics indicate a high risk of internal [Y] in children with [X] and , therefore , a need for very close monitoring .

Interactive segmentation of plexiform [Y] tissue : method and preliminary Plexiform [Y] -LRB- PNs -RRB- are a major manifestation of neurofibromatosis-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- , a common genetic disease involving the nervous system .

Interactive segmentation of plexiform [Y] tissue : method and preliminary Plexiform [Y] -LRB- PNs -RRB- are a major manifestation of neurofibromatosis-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- , a common genetic disease involving the nervous system .

BACKGROUND CONTEXT : One hallmark of neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is the presence of multiple [Y] , which are hormonally responsive and may undergo rapid growth during periods of hormonal surge .

Although spinal [Y] occur in up to % of patients with [X] , they rarely cause neurologic sequelae , especially in the young .

Comprehensive [X] , NF2 and SMARCB1 mutation analyses revealed no mutation in blood lymphocytes and in schwann cells cultured from plexiform [Y] .

Consistent with Knudson 's two-hit hypothesis , [X] patients harbouring a heterozygous germline [X] mutation develop [Y] upon somatic mutation of the second , wild-type , [X] allele .

While the identification of somatic mutations in [X] patients has always been problematic on account of the extensive cellular heterogeneity manifested by [Y] , the classification of [X] somatic mutations is a prerequisite for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying [X] tumorigenesis .

Here , the known somatic mutational spectrum for the [X] gene in a range of NF1-associated neoplasms - including peripheral nerve sheath tumours -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours , gastrointestinal stromal tumours , gastric carcinoid , juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia , glomus tumours , astrocytomas and phaeochromocytomas - have been collated and analysed .

PTEN and [X] inactivation in Schwann cells produces a severe phenotype in the The genetic evolution from a benign [Y] to a malignant sarcoma in patients with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- syndrome remains unclear .

Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells are believed to be the primary pathogenic cell in [Y] because they harbor biallelic neurofibromin -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene mutations .

Plexiform [Y] were also less prevalent in patients with mosaic type-2 [X] microdeletions as compared with patients carrying constitutional -LRB- germline -RRB- type-1 [X] microdeletions .

By contrast , a previous study indicated a high burden of cutaneous [Y] -LRB- N > -RRB- in % of adult patients with germline type-1 [X] deletions .

The tumor suppressor disorder neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is associated with development of multiple [Y] which may grow intraneurally as plexiform [Y] -LRB- PNF -RRB- or intracutaneously -LRB- CNF -RRB- .

Role of noncoding RNA ANRIL in genesis of plexiform [Y] in BACKGROUND : Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a tumor predisposition syndrome with a worldwide birth incidence of one in .

Genetic factors unrelated to the [X] locus are thought to influence the number of plexiform [Y] -LRB- PNFs -RRB- in patients with [X] , but no factors have been identified to date .

CONCLUSION : Identification of ANRIL as a modifier gene in [X] may offer clues to the molecular pathogenesis of PNFs , particularly [Y] formation , and emphasizes the unanticipated role of large noncoding RNA in activation of critical regulators of tumor development .

Risk factors for higher tumor volume included female gender -LRB- P = -RRB- and increasing subcutaneous [Y] -LRB- P = -RRB- in [X] patients , absence of cutaneous schwannomas in NF2 patients -LRB- P = -RRB- , and increasing age in schwannomatosis patients -LRB- p = -RRB- .

Hematopoietic-stromal interactions underpin the plexiform [Y] , a debilitating tumor arising in individuals afflicted with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- , a common genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the [X] tumor suppressor gene .

Skin-derived precursor cells as an in vitro modelling tool for the study of type The most characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is the development of [Y] .

Moreover , a nullizygous population of cells that is S100beta negative is present in human [Y] , and [X] -LRB- + / - -RRB- multipotent progenitor cells are seemingly recruited to the tumor .

This evidence supports the [Y] stem cell hypothesis and a putative involvement of SKPs in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease , suggesting that SKPs could become a valuable tool for the in vitro study of [X] .

Phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with BACKGROUND : Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth of plexiform [Y] -LRB- PN -RRB- in children with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of cutaneous [Y] , multiple cafd-au-lait spots and pigmented nodules of the iris known as Lisch nodules .

Biallelic inactivation of [X] in a sporadic plexiform [Y] .

Plexiform [Y] are a major cause of morbidity in individuals with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

A role for the [X] gene in solitary plexiform [Y] has never been described .

In this study , we report a boy who was diagnosed with a plexiform [Y] , without other [X] diagnostic criteria .

We conclude that biallelic [X] inactivation was at the origin of the isolated plexiform [Y] in this patient .

Treatment of diffuse [Y] -LRB- not associated with [X] -RRB- is often surgical resection .

In this report , we presented an adult patient , without [X] diagnosed , who developed invalidate status of left upper limb due to a giant diffuse [Y] involving the left brachial plexus , with a high growth diffuse pattern and plexiform architecture imagistic , grossly and without results at both surgical interventions .

Plexiform [Y] of the eye region occurring in patients without PURPOSE : The purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between Plexiform [Y] -LRB- PN -RRB- of the eye region and Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Patients affected by [X] typically present with cutaneous [Y] , cafe au lait spots and eye involvement , but they can also be affected by various visceral tumors , such as [Y] -LRB- nodular or plexiform type -RRB- , gastrointestinal stromal tumors or endocrine tumors , such as pheochromocytomas .

The [Y] is the hallmark lesion of [X] that develops from peripheral nerves .

Genetic alterations in a malignant schwannoma from a patient with In a patient with neurofibromatosis -LRB- von Recklinghausen disease ; [X] -RRB- , normal lymphocytes , five cutaneous [Y] , and tumour tissue from a recurrence of a malignant schwannoma were analysed for genetic alterations .

Our data indicate that the [X] gene may function as a tumour suppressor gene , and that , either by effect of dose reduction or complete inactivation , both the [X] gene and the TP53 gene may be critical for the progression of a [Y] to a malignant schwannoma .

Immunoblotting also revealed positive expression of the [X] gene product in the brain , the normal peripheral nerves , and of ENU-induced [Y] .

Neuroblastoma growth factors derived from [Y] -LRB- [X] -RRB- : participation of Human glioma cell extracts were found to elicit a marked growth-promoting activity on human neuroblastoma cells .

This activity was also detected in the extracts of [Y] type -LRB- [X] ; von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis -RRB- comprising aberrant Schwann cell growth .

Identification of [X] mutations in both alleles of a dermal [Y] .

A hallmark clinical feature of neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- is multiple dermal [Y] , benign tumours that typically appear in early adolescence and increase in numbers throughout life .

Even though accumulating evidence demonstrates that [X] acts as a tumour suppressor in some cells , mutations have not been identified in both [X] alleles in dermal [Y] .

In contrast to these reports , Colman et al. demonstrated [X] LOH of dermal [Y] derived from of [X] patients , yet the constitutional [X] mutations in these patients were not identified , and the extent of the somatic deletions beyond the [X] locus were not established .

In this study , we show that a dermal [Y] from an [X] individual who has a constitutional deletion of the entire [X] locus harbours a deletion of [X] exon in the other allele .

This is the first definitive identification of a somatic mutation which is limited to the [X] locus in a benign [Y] from an [X] individual in whom the constitutional [X] mutation is known .

All five patients with deletions were remarkable for exhibiting a large number of [Y] for their age , suggesting that deletion of an unknown gene in the [X] region may affect tumor initiation or development .

Findings previously unreported in [X] included an aqueductal web resulting in hydrocephalus , intraocular [Y] resulting in retinal detachment , and asymptomatic enlargement of the septum pellucidum .

Regulation of neurofibromin expression in rat sciatic nerve and cultured Schwann Loss of function mutations at the [X] locus may act intrinsically in Schwann cells to cause the formation of benign Schwann cell tumors -LRB- [Y] -RRB- in patients with type neurofibromatosis .

Novel alleles , hemizygosity and deletions at an Alu-repeat within the Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- -LRB- von Recklinghausen -RRB- is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterised by the presence of peripheral [Y] , cafe-au-lait spots and Lisch nodules of the iris .

Ras-GTP levels were increased in [X] neurogenic sarcomas -LRB- times -RRB- and benign [X] [Y] -LRB- four times -RRB- , compared to non [X] schwannomas .

The majority of tumors occurring in patients with [X] are benign [Y] , sarcomatous transformation is uncommon and most often occurs within the larger plexiform [Y] .

The molecular basis of [Y] development in [X] is loss of expression of the [X] gene and its gene product , neurofibromin , resulting in elevated levels of Ras-guanosine triphosphate .

[X] is characterized by the appearance of cafe-au-lait spots and [Y] in addition to iris hamartomas , or Lisch nodules , of the eye , during the first and second decades .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- , also called von Recklinghausen disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis , is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterised by multiple [Y] , cafe au lait spots , and Lisch nodules of the iris , with a variable clinical expression .

The most common symptomatic manifestation of [X] is the plexiform [Y] .

Repression of the [X] gene by Tax may expain the development of [Y] in In familial neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- , individuals with a germ line-transmitted [X] mutation develop multiple [Y] .

To explain the observation that transgenic mice expressing the human T-lymphotropic virus type -LRB- HTLV-1 -RRB- tax gene under the control of the viral regulatory element also develop multiple [Y] , we demonstrate that the Tax trans-regulator can functionally repress [X] gene expression through a cis-acting element located immediately upstream of its transcriptional start site , thereby allowing the development of benign [Y] without the need for direct mutations in [X] .

A typical alteration observed in [X] is the eyelid plexiform [Y] , often associated with facial homolateral hypertrophy .

A Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a common , autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a variety of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations -LRB- such as cafe au lait spots -RRB- , Lisch nodules , plexiform [Y] , skeletal abnormalities , an increased risk for malignancy , and the development of learning disabilities .

To test for loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- at the neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene locus , three intragenic polymorphic markers were analyzed after polymerase chain reaction amplification , starting from single SC isolated from primary cultures of [Y] , of five informative [X] patients .

The detection of contiguous gene deletions at the neurofibromatosis locus with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a common genetic disorder characterized primarily by the development of multiple [Y] and pigmentary changes .

FISH studies performed with P1-9 , P1-12 , and a set of overlapping cosmid clones mapping telomeric to the [X] locus identified large deletions in two new neurofibromatosis type patients who , like previously characterized deletion patients , had mildly dysmorphic facial features and large numbers of cutaneous [Y] .

Scanning the first part of the neurofibromatosis type gene by RNA-SSCP : Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- of von Recklinghausen is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterized by peripheral [Y] , cafe-au-lait spots and Lisch nodules of the iris .

Characteristics which the two main forms [X] and NF2 have in common are a positive family history , characteristic skin alterations , such as cafe au lait macules , axillary or inguinal freckling and neural tumors such as [Y] and optic glioma -LRB- [X] -RRB- as well as -LRB- bilateral -RRB- vestibular schwannomas -LRB- NF2 -RRB- .

A novel mutation in [X] is associated with diverse intra-familial phenotypic Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a dysregulated neurocutaneous disorder , characterized by [Y] and cafe-au-lait spots .

Dermal [Y] are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type one -LRB- [X] -RRB- , and their developmental origin still unsolved .

Although [X] loss is required for [Y] initiation , some features of these benign tumors resemble a skin injury state and cutaneous trauma or other insults might support tumor development .

Since adult terminal Schwann cells ensheathing nerve endings are able to dedifferentiate into a progenitor-like state in response to nerve crushing , we hypothesized that dedifferentiation of [X] - / - Schwann cells could be at the origin of human dermal [Y] .

We posit that onset of nerve regeneration might have a role in dermal [Y] initiation via dedifferentiation of [X] - / - Schwann cells .

Using a qualitative approach to conceptualize concerns of patients with Neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [X] -RRB- plexiform [Y] -LRB- pNFs -RRB- are associated with a variety of symptoms and concerns that affect patients ' quality of life -LRB- QOL -RRB- , highlighting the value of incorporating the patients ' perspective when evaluating treatment outcomes .

Patient was a woman with [X] and a progressive low grade MPNST developing from a diffuse/plexiform orbital [Y] that arose in childhood .

Because we now know that the presence of cafe-au-lait macules and freckling might not distinguish between [X] and other conditions such as Legius syndrome , definitive [X] was defined as the presence of cafe-au-lait macules with or without freckling plus one of the following : Lisch nodules , [Y] , plexiform [Y] , bone dysplasia , optic pathway glioma , or familial history of [X] .

Sleep and pulmonary outcomes for clinical trials of airway plexiform OBJECTIVE : Plexiform [Y] -LRB- PNs -RRB- are complex , benign nerve sheath tumors that occur in approximately % % of individuals with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Children with [X] are particularly at risk for the development of tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system , such as [Y] , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors , and low-grade astrocytomas of the optic pathway and other brain regions .

[X] is generally complicated with one or more neurobehavioral disorders or tumors located in the peripheral nervous system such as [Y] , peripheral nerve sheath tumor , pheochromocytoma , etc. .

Orofacial manifestations in [X] have been documented before but occurrence of multifocal intraosseous -LRB- IO -RRB- and extraosseous -LRB- EO -RRB- [Y] is rare .

The present case highlights the importance of imaging findings in the diagnosis and management of multifocal jaw , infratemporal , and parotid [Y] with muscular hypoplasia in an eight-year-old girl with [X] .

Deregulation of RAS signaling in Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- results in the development of multiple [Y] , complex tumor of the peripheral nerves with no effective medical treatment .

There is increasing evidences that [Y] initiates through loss of [X] function in the Schwann cell lineage , followed by a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the surrounding tumor microenvironment .

In [X] patients , [Y] always develop along peripheral nerves and do not migrate to distant organs , including the central nervous system .

His past and family histories were unremarkable ; however , small [Y] and cafe au lait spots all over his body led to the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a progressive genetic disorder characterized by physical findings such as cafe-au-lait macules , Lisch nodules , and [Y] in addition to other medical complications .

Neurofibromatosis type associated low grade gliomas : A comparison with sporadic Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disorder , associated with a variable clinical phenotype including cafe-au-lait spots , intertriginous freckling , Lisch nodules , [Y] , optic pathway gliomas and distinctive bony lesions .

Immortalization of human normal and [X] [Y] Schwann cells .

A combined one-stage surgical approach of orbital tumor debulking , lid BACKGROUND AND AIM : To describe a series of children with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- and a plexiform [Y] of the orbit with ptosis who underwent a combined one-stage surgery for tumor debulking , lid reconstruction , and ptosis repair .

In [X] , involvement of vagus nerve can occur in the form of [Y] .

A few cases of [Y] of thoracic vagus nerve have been reported while [Y] of cervical vagus nerve with [X] is quite rare .

He was diagnosed as having [X] with [Y] of right cervical vagus nerve .

The present study reports the clinical and biomolecular features of EN in a [X] patient with the clear clinical diagnostic criteria of multiple cafe-au-lait macules , [Y] , EN , a positive family history and a novel [X] germline c. mutation .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an inherited disease in which affected patients are predisposed to develop benign Schwann cell -LRB- SC -RRB- tumours called [Y] .

Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a multisystem genetic disease which is characterized by cutaneous findings , most importantly cafe-au-lait spots and axillary freckling , by skeletal dysplasia , and by the growth of both benign and malignant nervous system neoplasms , most notably benign [Y] .

[X] frameshift mutation -LRB- c. -RRB- association with nervous system Neurofibromatosis type , also known as [X] or von Recklinghausen 's disease , is a common neurocutaneous syndrome that presents with multiple cafe-au-lait patches , skinfold freckling , dermatofibromas , [Y] , and Lisch nodules .

Plexiform [Y] are benign tumors originating from peripheral nerve sheaths , generally associated with Neurofibromatosis Type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

INTRODUCTION : Intraparotid [Y] of the facial nerve are extremely rare and mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Chronic pain is commonly reported among individuals with [X] and plexiform [Y] tumors -LRB- PNs -RRB- .

Cutaneous [Y] are the hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

The results led us to speculate that the development of cutaneous [Y] includes the recruitment of multipotent [X] -LRB- + / - -RRB- precursor cells .

This patient had been previously diagnosed with [X] on the basis of multiple CAL macules and suspected subcutaneous [Y] .

Preclincial testing of sorafenib and RAD001 in the Nf -LRB- flox/flox -RRB- ; DhhCre mouse BACKGROUND : Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an inherited disease predisposing affected patients to variable numbers of benign [Y] .

The most common and important problems in [X] are cognitive impairment , optic pathway gliomas , plexiform [Y] , and orthopaedic issues .

Among [X] patients , MIA serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform [Y] and in those with large number of cutaneous -LRB- > -RRB- or subcutaneous -LRB- > -RRB- [Y] than in patients without such tumours .

Different patterns of mast cells distinguish diffuse from encapsulated Multiple [Y] are cardinal features of neurofibromatosis -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Mast cells are present in most [Y] and have been shown to be critical to the origin and progression of [Y] in both human [X] and relevant mouse models .

A total of Finnish patients with [X] , including four patients with plexiform [Y] of the cranial nerve , and their age - and gender-matched controls , were enrolled in the study .

These neoplasms , which are termed dermal and plexiform [Y] respectively , have distinct clinical courses ; of particular note , plexiform , but not dermal , [Y] often undergo malignant progression to form malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors -LRB- MPNSTs -RRB- , the most common malignancy occurring in [X] patients .

These models have been designed to address key questions including : -LRB- -RRB- whether [X] loss in the Schwann cell lineage is essential for tumorigenesis ; -LRB- -RRB- what cell type -LRB- s -RRB- in the Schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal [Y] , plexiform [Y] and MPNSTs ; -LRB- -RRB- how the tumor microenvironment contributes to neoplasia ; -LRB- -RRB- what additional mutations contribute to neurofibroma-MPNST progression ; -LRB- -RRB- what role different neurofibromin-regulated Ras proteins play in this process and -LRB- -RRB- how dysregulated growth factor signaling facilitates PNS tumorigenesis .

We report the first case of a plexiform [Y] from a [X] patient containing exclusively lipoblast-like cells exhibiting morphological and immunohistochemical features identical to univaculoted lipoblasts typically seen in myxoid liposarcoma .

Little is known about the origin and nature of atypical [Y] in [X] patients .

In this study , we classified the atypical [Y] in the spectrum of NF1-associated PNSTs by analyzing tumor samples from [X] patients .

Exceptions are cases reporting the in-frame microdeletion c. , presenting with the typical pigmentary features of [X] , but no cutaneous or plexiform [Y] .

We confirm the association of the c. mutation in [X] with a particular clinical phenotype , especially with lack of detectable [Y] .

In the absence of [Y] , starting [X] testing with the screening of exon may be worthwhile .

We report the detailed clinical presentation and molecular features of a spinal neurofibromatosis familial case where a woman , presenting with multiple bilateral spinal [Y] and no other clinical feature of neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- , inherited a paternal large multiexonic deletion -LRB- c. - ?

RESULTS : Radiologic abnormalities in the jaws were found in of patients with [X] , including patients with plexiform [Y] in the head and neck region .

Dissecting loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- in neurofibromatosis type Dermal [Y] -LRB- dNFs -RRB- are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system typically associated with Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- patients .

Genes controlling the integrity of the DNA are likely to influence the number of [Y] developed because dNFs are caused by somatic mutational inactivation of the [X] gene , frequently evidenced by loss of heterozygosity -LRB- LOH -RRB- .

The bi-allelic inactivation of the [X] gene through a `` second hit '' seems to be of crucial importance to the development of certain manifestations , such as [Y] , cafe-au-lait macules , and glomus tumors .

A recent study identified a multipotent precursor cell population with an [X] -LRB- + / - -RRB- genotype that resides in human cutaneous [Y] and that has been suggested to play a role in their pathogenesis .

Nf1 - / Neurofibromatosis type -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a common genetic disorder and is characterized by both malignant and nonmalignant [Y] , which are composed of Schwann cells , degranulating mast cells , fibroblasts , and extracellular matrix .

The authors review their experience with the management of a giant -LRB- lb -RRB- [Y] of the lower extremity in a male with [X] .

Nullizygous -LRB- [X] -LRB- - / - -RRB- -RRB- SKPs do give rise to [Y] when transplanted to heterozygous mice .

[Y] is associated with a unique chromosomal translocation t -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- p ; q -RRB- that involves the [X] and WT1 genes .

[Y] is associated with a unique chromosomal translocation t -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- p ; q -RRB- that involves the [X] and WT1 genes .

Southern hybridization showed that the Ewing sarcoma gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene was rearranged in the [Y] .

Southern hybridization showed that the Ewing sarcoma gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene was rearranged in the [Y] .

The fusion of these two genes in [Y] results in the production of a putatively oncogenic protein composed of the zinc finger DNA binding domains of WT-1 linked to potential transcriptional regulatory domains of [X] .

The different translocation partners of the [X] gene , all of which are putative or definite transcription factor genes , may be responsible for the biological differences between [Y] , Ewing 's sarcoma , and clear cell sarcoma .

Breakpoint characterization of large deletions in [X] or EXT2 in multiple BACKGROUND : [Y] -LRB- cartilage-capped bone tumors -RRB- are by far the most commonly treated of all primary benign bone tumors -LRB- % -RRB- .

The amplification status of HER2 , C-MYC , [X] and FGFR1 was generally similar in the matched invasive and [Y] components of the same tumors .

In this study , we detected CyclinD1 expression using immunohistochemistry and [X] gene copy number using fluorescence in situ hybridization -LRB- FISH -RRB- in invasive breast cancers with foci ductal carcinoma in situ -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Interestingly , when comparing the infiltrating and non-invasive areas for the same tumour , we found three cases with [X] amplification in the infiltrating areas but not in the [Y] areas .

Our data also suggest that CHK1 deletion is an early genetic event in the development of breast cancer and can be detected at the [Y] stage , whereas [X] amplification is more likely to be associated with tumour progression .

Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer -LRB- such as BRCA1 and [X] -RRB- , as well as a precursor lesion of [Y] called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma , which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies .

-LSB- Oncopathological aspects of BRCA1 and [X] genes inactivation in tumors of Ovarian carcinoma represents a heterogeneous group of malignant epithelial tumors which could be divided into two fundamental groups : Type I -LRB- endometrioid carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma , low grade serous carcinoma , mucinous carcinoma and more rare seromucinous carcinoma and malignant Brenner tumor -RRB- and type II -LRB- high grade serous carcinoma - [Y] -RRB- .

CTNNB1 genotyping and [X] screening in pediatric [Y] tumors : a proposed [Y] fibromatosis is a rare , locally aggressive fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumor that occasionally involves children .

We examined a series of pediatric [Y] for CTNNB1 mutations , seen in sporadic tumors , and [X] germline mutations , associated with familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- FAP -RRB- .

Germline [X] mutations were present in -LRB- % -RRB- [Y] patients .

We present the physical history , clinical presentation , diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a novel germline [X] mutation , the W421X mutation , which resulted in FAP presenting with about a hundred colorectal polyps , gastric hyperplastic polyps and multiple aggressive intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal [Y] tumors .

Because germline [X] analysis is not routinely performed in children with [Y] tumours , the diagnosis FAP may escape detection .

The aim of this study is to form guidelines for the identification of possible [X] germline mutation carriers among children with [Y] tumours , based on CTNNB1 mutation analysis and immunohistochemical analysis -LRB- IHC -RRB- for beta-catenin .

PATIENTS AND METHODS : We performed IHC of beta-catenin and mutation analysis of CTNNB1 and [X] in paediatric [Y] tumours , diagnosed between and in the Erasmus MC , Rotterdam .

Using an MSC cell line derived from an FAP-associated [Y] tumor , we confirmed an expected loss in the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli -LRB- [X] -RRB- and the transcriptional repressor BMI-1 while documenting the coexpression of markers for chondrocytes , adipocytes , and osteocytes .

Together , our findings argue that [Y] tumors result from the growth of MSCs in a wound healing setting that is associated with deregulated Wnt signaling due to [X] loss .

This study investigated the risk of [Y] in FAP , the relation between specific [X] gene mutations and [Y] formation , and the clinical characteristics of FAP patients with [Y] .

No ' [X] mutations were detected in two patients with [Y] tumours and a family history of colorectal cancer and polyps .

FAP is caused by mutations in the [X] gene and various genotype-phenotype relationships have been defined including reports that colorectal polyposis is less severe with mutations ' to codon and that the risk of [Y] tumours is high in FAP patients with [X] gene mutations between codons and .

There is relatively little information on the phenotype of [X] gene mutations ' to codon ; however , one large family has been reported with a mutation at codon which presents with a highly variable phenotype which includes [Y] disease .

These findings demonstrate -LRB- i -RRB- that FAP and FIF are allelic , and -LRB- ii -RRB- that [X] gene mutations which truncate the [X] protein distal to the beta-catenin binding domain are associated with [Y] tumours , absent CHRPE and variable but attenuated polyposis expression .

INTRODUCTION : Gardner 's syndrome is the association of familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- FAP -RRB- with an anaphase promoting complex -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene mutation and several extradigestive manifestations : osteomas , epidermal cysts and [Y] tumours .

Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis with [Y] caused by an [X] We present here a case of attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- AFAP -RRB- with a family history of [Y] and thyroid tumors .

In cases with limited numbers of colonic polyps and [Y] , AFAP may be caused by a mutation in the ' region of [X] .

Extracolonic findings associated with FAP that were most likely to prompt [X] testing in an otherwise asymptomatic year-old child with a negative family history were multiple [Y] tumors , congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium -LRB- CHRPE -RRB- , jaw osteomas , and hepatoblastoma .

Hereditary [Y] tumours arise in individuals affected by either familial adenomatous polyposis -LRB- FAP -RRB- or hereditary [Y] disease -LRB- HDD -RRB- carrying germline mutations in [X] .

Tamibarotene -LRB- Am80 -RRB- , a synthetic retinoid approved in Japan for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , is a retinoic acid receptor -LRB- [X] -RRB- agonist with high specificity for RARalpha and RARbeta over RARgamma .

Case of pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia presenting as extramedullary tumor BACKGROUND : Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a malignant subtype of acute myeloid leukemia caused by the PML-retinoic acid receptor -LRB- [X] -RRB- alpha fusion gene .

The most frequent is the t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q22 ; q21 -RRB- , which fuses the PML and [X] genes , giving rise to acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

The observation that particular regions of the PML and [X] loci are susceptible to topoII-mediated DNA damage induced by epirubicin and mitoxantrone may underlie the propensity of these agents to cause [Y] .

Characterization of cryptic rearrangements , deletion , complex variants of PML , Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is characterized by a reciprocal translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q22 ; q21 -RRB- leading to the disruption of Promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- PML -RRB- and Retionic Acid Receptor Alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- followed by reciprocal PML-RARA fusion in % of the cases .

In the present study , besides diagnostic approach we sought to analyze these cases for identification and characterization of cryptic rearrangements , deletion variants and unknown [X] translocation variants by application of D-FISH and [X] break-apart probe strategy on interphase and metaphase cells in a large series of cases of [Y] .

The cell biology of disease : Acute promyelocytic leukemia , arsenic , and PML Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is driven by a chromosomal translocation whose product , the PML/retinoic acid -LRB- RA -RRB- receptor alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- fusion protein , affects both nuclear receptor signaling and PML body assembly .

In the [Y] cell line NB4 , the PML gene is fused with the [X] alpha gene due to a chromosomal rearrangement .

Localization of the chromosome breakpoints and expression of multiple PML-RAR Translocation -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q22 ; q12-q21 -RRB- is a chromosome aberration specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , that generates a chimeric gene between the promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- PML -RRB- gene on chromosome and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene , on chromosome .

In addition , a new variant , t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q32 ; q12 -RRB- , with a [X] rearrangement was described in a child with atypical [Y] .

Whereas [X] rearrangement appears sufficient for an APL-like phenotype , it seems that the presence of a classical PML/RARA is required for typical [Y] with response to ATRA .

In many [Y] patients , translocation between [X] alpha gene and an oncogenic gene , PML , can be detected , although the roles of their fusion products -LRB- [X] alpha-PML and PML-RAR alpha -RRB- in [Y] induction have not been understood .

The t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation , specifically associated with the human acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- to a novel gene PML generating the hybrid protein PML-RAR .

In [Y] , one of the [X] genes , [X] , is fused to PML in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- .

The PML-RAR alpha gene product of the t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation inhibits retinoic Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is characterized by an arrest of granulocytic differentiation and a reciprocal t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation fusing the PML gene to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- gene .

Retinoic acid regulates aberrant nuclear localization of PML-RAR alpha in acute Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is characterized by a specific t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation that fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- to a novel gene product , PML .

PML , a Ring-finger protein , participates in the disruption of normal myeloid differentiation when fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- by the translocation between chromosomes -LRB- Chrs -RRB- and in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

All-trans retinoic acid -LRB- RA -RRB- induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- presumably by binding directly to [X] alpha of [Y] cells .

To determine if alterations of the ligand binding domain of [X] alpha might be involved in several malignant hematologic disorders , the mutational status of this region -LRB- exons , , and -RRB- was examined in samples that included a variety of cell lines and fresh cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes -LRB- MDS -RRB- and acute myeloid leukemias -LRB- AML -RRB- , including [Y] patients , of whom were resistant to RA and who was refractory to RA at diagnosis , using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism -LRB- PCR-SSCP -RRB- analysis and DNA sequencing .

Detection of PML/retinoic acid receptor a gene rearrangements by polymerase chain Breakpoints of the ; translocation in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- have been identified within PML and retinoic acid receptor a -LRB- [X] -RRB- genes in chromosomes and , respectively .

In this study , PCR analysis using genomic DNA of [Y] cells is proved to be useful for identifying the breakpoints of the PML and the [X] genes .

A rational biologic basis for safe sexual conduct in preventing the spread of Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for PML-RAR alpha fusion Chromosome translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- results in cleavage in the introns of PML gene on chromosome and in the intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- gene on chromosome , creation and expression of PML-RAR alpha and [X] alpha-PML fusion genes .

-LRB- -RRB- [Y] is not a homogeneous disease in that among patients studied at the molecular level , although a PML-RARA fusion gene was detected in cases , one had a variant translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- bearing fusion gene PLZF-RARA , one presented no obvious structural alteration of the PML gene while the [X] gene was rearranged , and three patients had no rearrangement of either PML or [X] genes .

[Y] is characterized by three distinct and unique features : i -RRB- accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features ; ii -RRB- invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- locus ; iii -RRB- exquisite sensitivity of [Y] blasts to the differentiating action of retinoic acid -LRB- RA -RRB- .

Functional analysis of the various fusion proteins as well as [X] alpha partners is revealing strikingly common features beneath a misleading structural heterogeneity which unravels a possible unifying molecular mechanism towards [Y] leukemogenesis .

A non-classical translocation involving -LRB- retinoic acid receptor alpha -RRB- in Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- almost always involves a chromosomal translocation t -LRB- -RRB- that results in the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- gene with a transcription factor gene called PML .

Several cases of [Y] with t -LRB- ; -RRB- have recently been described , involving fusion of the [X] alpha gene with a new zinc finger gene named PLZF .

We report here a second non-classical translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- , with a rearranged [X] alpha gene in a child with [Y] .

The identification of a second variant translocation involving the [X] alpha gene in [Y] suggests yet another [X] alpha rearrangement related to neoplastic myelopoiesis .

Which progenitor is the target cell in the development of acute promyelocytic Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is characterized by the t -LRB- ; -RRB- which involves the PML gene and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- gene , and the subsequent PML/RAR alpha fusion gene is a key event in the leukemogenesis of [Y] .

Moreover , in the t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , PML fusion to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- is the likely molecular basis of leukaemogenesis .

-LSB- Molecular study of the mechanism of chromosomal translocation -LRB- ; -RRB- in acute Molecular studies of chromosomal translocation -LRB- ; -RRB- in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- have shown that retinoic acid receptor A -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene on chromosome is juxtaposed to the PML gene on chromosome .

Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is thought to be caused by the t -LRB- -RRB- translocation that fuses the PML gene to that of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- and generates a PML/RAR alpha fusion protein .

Recently , clinical use of retinoic acid in acute pro-myelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- was proposed to induce complete remission in the leukemic cells , which have the t -LRB- -RRB- of chromosomal anomaly producing a different protein from the normal [X] .

[Y] is characterized cytogenetically by a t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation which involves both the PML gene on chromosome and the [X] alpha gene on chromosome and gives rise to the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein .

PLZF-RAR alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- Recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- which juxtaposes PLZF , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to [X] , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- .

PLZF-RAR alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- Recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q23 ; q21 -RRB- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- which juxtaposes PLZF , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to [X] , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- .

In transient-expression assays , both the PLZF -LRB- A -RRB- - [X] alpha and PLZF -LRB- B -RRB- - [X] alpha fusion proteins like the PML-RAR alpha protein resulting from the well-known t -LRB- ; -RRB- translocation in [Y] , antagonized endogenous and transfected wild-type [X] alpha in the presence of retinoic acid .

Interferons induce normal and aberrant retinoic-acid receptors type alpha in Treatment of the acute promyelocytic -LRB- [Y] -RRB- cell line NB4 with interferon alpha -LRB- IFN -LRB- alpha -RRB- -RRB- , as well as IFN -LRB- beta -RRB- and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic-acid receptor type alpha -LRB- [X] -LRB- alpha -RRB- -RRB- and the leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor PML-RAR .

PML has been identified through its fusion to the [X] alpha gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Treatment of [Y] cells with RA , RA or analogs of [X] alpha or RXR alpha also failed to induce apoptosis .

Molecular analysis of the [Y] breakpoint has revealed the involvement of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene on chromosome and the promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- PML -RRB- gene on chromosome .

The fusion of [X] alpha and PML consistent with [Y] appears to have occurred at the distal juxtaposition of these sequences in the derivative chromosome .

Fluorescence in situ hybridization -LRB- FISH -RRB- using cosmidic probes specific for [X] alpha and PML , regions did not show a fusion signal as in [Y] .

Molecular diagnosis and monitoring of acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with The characteristic balanced ; translocation , t -LRB- ; -RRB- , of acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- gene on chromosome to PML , a recently described gene of unknown function , on chromosome .

Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with break points in the -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene and the zyl gene also produces a fusion transcript .

These data , along with previous reports of rare variant translocations in [Y] , indicate that while dysregulation of [X] by gene fusion may be essential for the [Y] phenotype , the particular fusion partner may determine clinicopathological aspects , including presentation , response to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid -LRB- ATRA -RRB- , and prognosis .

Most patients with [Y] express del -LRB- -RRB- - derived [X] alpha-PML transcripts as well as the putative leukemogenic PML-RAR alpha associated with add -LRB- -RRB- .

Although parallel assessment of PML-RAR alpha and [X] alpha-PML can enhance minimal residual disease detection in [Y] , this study demonstrates that treatment strategies involving determination of PCR status post-consolidation , even using [X] alpha-PML in addition to the more conventional PML-RAR alpha assay will fail to identify all patients at risk of relapse .

LYSP100-associated nuclear domains -LRB- LANDs -RRB- : description of a new class of The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- gene in t -LRB- ; -RRB- acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , creating a PML-RAR alpha fusion oncoprotein .

We describe a patient with the microgranular variant form of [Y] , with no detectable cytogenetic abnormality of either chromosomes or , who nevertheless had juxtaposition of PML and [X] genes and expressed a chimeric transcript .

Our results show that [Y] patients with cytogenetically normal chromosomes and may , nevertheless , have involvement of both PML and [X] genes defining a subgroup of [Y] , t -LRB- ; -RRB- - negative/PML-RARA-positive which is analogous to Philadelphia chromosome-negative/BCR-ABL-positive CML .

Paradoxically , [Y] cells express PML-RAR , an aberrant form of the retinoic acid receptor type alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- derived from the leukemia-specific t -LRB- ; -RRB- chromosomal translocation .

We show here that AM580 , a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a [X] alpha agonist , is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in NB4 , an APL-derived cell line , and in freshly isolated [Y] blasts .

Detection of PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusion transcripts in acute Chromosome translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- , the breakpoints of which are in the PML gene on chromosome and retinoic acid receptor-alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- gene on chromosome , is specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Clinically typical [Y] without t -LRB- ; -RRB- and with the PML-RAR alpha fusion transcripts or rearrangements in PML and/or [X] alpha gene has been reported , suggesting submicroscopic changes at the molecular level without apparent t -LRB- ; -RRB- or observation of normal metaphases .

Fusion between a novel Kruppel-like zinc finger gene and the retinoic acid We have identified a unique case of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with a t -LRB- ; -RRB- reciprocal chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] alpha -RRB- and a previously uncharacterized zinc finger gene .

Our results demonstrate for the first time the association of a variant chromosomal translocation involving the [X] alpha gene with [Y] , further implicating the [X] alpha in leukaemogenesis and also suggesting an important role for PLZF as well as retinoic acid and its receptors in myeloid maturation .

Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is characterized by a unique hemorrhagic syndrome , disseminated intravascular coagulation , and the association with the specific -LRB- ; chi q22-23 : q12-21 -RRB- translocation , which disrupts the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- and the promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- PML -RRB- genes .

Demonstration of the existence , in some APL-like leukemias , of masked translocations with involvement of PML and [X] , thus allows to -LRB- i -RRB- confirm the diagnosis of [Y] , -LRB- ii -RRB- adapt the treatment and -LRB- iii -RRB- monitor the residual disease .

Because the ratio of expression of PML/RAR alpha to wild-type [X] alpha and PML may be important in maintaining the dominant negative block of myelocytic differentiation , these data suggest a molecular mechanism for restoration by tRA normal myeloid differentiation in [Y] cells .

PIC , a novel ubiquitin-like protein which interacts with the PML component of a Acute promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- arises following a reciprocal translocation t -LRB- ; -RRB- that fuses PML with retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Identification of illegitimate recombination hot spot of the retinoic acid Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- has been characterized by ; chromosomal translocation , which involves the retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene on chromosome and the PML gene on chromosome .

Acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- AML -RRB- that is characterized by a balanced translocation between chromosomes and -LSB- t -LRB- ; -RRB- -RSB- , which results in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- PML -RRB- and retinoic acid receptor alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- genes .
