due to the yamanote line's central location con<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>ting most of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s major commuter hubs and commercial areas, the line is very heavily used.

 likewise, from 14 march 2015 onwards, the ueno-<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> line starts services, which con<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>ts the tohoku main line and joban line to the tokaido main line, to provide further relief on the busiest portion of the yamanote line today, the segment between ueno and <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> stations.

 the principle justification of the proposal is to reduce con<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>tion time from narita airport to <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> station by 13 minutes, and the design of the proposal makes this much more a high-speed rail project than a subway project (though, it would likely not be up to all of japan's shinkansen high-speed rail standards).

 the proposal would essentially allow the skyliner to run to the more important <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> station as well as establish a high-speed con<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>tion to the haneda airport.

in europe, in 2010, there were 14,000 brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from spain (estimated at only 20–25 animals in the pyrenees in 2010, in a range shared between spain, france and andorra, and some 210 animals in asturias, cantabria, galicia and león, in the picos de europa and adjacent <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s in 2013) in the west, to russia in the east, and from sweden and <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> in the north to romania (5000–6000), bulgaria (900–1200), slovakia (with about 600–800 animals), slovenia (500–700 animals) and greece (with about 200 animals) in the south.

 plague did not appear in douai in flanders until the turn of the 15th century, and the impact was less severe on the populations of hainaut, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, northern germany, and <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of poland.

 this migration took place in just five to six generations and led to peoples from <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> in the west to thailand in the east employing the same metal working technology and, in some <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s, horse breeding and riding.

 the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> that is now <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 bc during the stone age towards the end of the last glacial period.

 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> proper was the most densely populated <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>.

as a result of the crusades (mostly with the second crusade led by birger jarl) and the colonization of some finnish coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s with christian swedish population during the middle ages, including the old capital turku, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> gradually became part of the kingdom of sweden and the sphere of influence of the catholic church.

 by this time <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was the predominant term for the whole <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> from the gulf of bothnia to the russian border.

 this amounted to 10% of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s land <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and 20% of its industrial capacity, including the ports of vyborg (viipuri) and the ice-free liinakhamari (liinahamari).

<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> has about 168,000 lakes (of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> larger than ) and 179,000 islands.

winters in southern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (when mean daily temperature remains below ) are usually about 100 days long, and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late november to april, and on the coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s such as helsinki, snow often covers the land from late december to late march.

 historically, counties are divisions of historical provinces of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s which represent dialects and culture more accurately.

 the greater helsinki <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> generates around one third of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s gdp.

 the "forest industry" includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is often considered a logical development based on <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s extensive forest resources, as 73% of the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> is covered by forest.

<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> has top levels of economic freedom in many <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s.

 two of the three largest cities in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> are situated in the greater helsinki metropolitan <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>—helsinki and espoo, and some municipalities in the metropolitan <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> have also shown clear growth of population year after year, the most notable being järvenpää, nurmijärvi, kirkkonummi, kerava and sipoo.

 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> can be divided into three <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s: archipelagoes and coastal lowlands, a slightly higher central lake plateau and uplands to north and northeast.

 northern and eastern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> are sparsely populated containing vast wilderness <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s.

<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s total <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> is .

 after the continuation war <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> lost major land <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s to russia in the moscow armistice of 1944, and the figure was said to have lost the other of her arms, as well as a hem of her "skirt".

 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> can be divided into three topographical <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s; the coastal landscapes, the interior lake plateau also known as finnish lake district and upland <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 upland <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s higher than 200 m are found mostly in the north and east of the country.

the third largest lake, lake inari in the lapland province of extreme northern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, has a surface <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of , a total shore length of , a maximum depth of , some 3,318 islands, and a total water volume of .

the earliest inhabitants of most of the land <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> that makes up today's <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and scandinavia were in all likehood hunter-gatherers whose closest successors in modern terms would probably be the sami people (formerly known as the lapps).

 during the late 19th and 20th century there was significant emigration, particularly from rural <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s to sweden and north america, while most immigrants into <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> itself come from other european countries.

in 1988, about 90 percent of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s 4,400 sami-speaking citizens lived in the municipalities of enontekiö, inari, and utsjoki, and in the reindeer-herding <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of sodankylä.

 in 2009, 55% of the 9,350 sami in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> lived outside of this <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>.

 finnish independence brought complete civil rights, and during the interwar period there were some 2,000 jews in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, most of them living in urban <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s in the south.

 later, however, beginning in the second half of the 19th century with the coming of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s tardy industrialization, there was a slow movement from rural regions toward <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s in the south where employment could be found.

 it was a massive population shift from rural <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s, especially those of eastern and northeastern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, to the urban, industrialized south.

the convergence of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and the european community began in the autumn of 1989 with the decision to join the european economic <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (eea).

 however, because the gulf stream and the north atlantic drift current moderate the climate, and because of the relatively low elevation of the land <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> contains half of the world's arable land north of 60° north latitude.

 this policy enjoyed some success: the total <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> under cultivation increased, and farm incomes fell less sharply in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> than in most other countries.

 the waterway system covered much of the country, and by the 1980s <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> had extended roadways and railroads to <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s not served by waterways, effectively opening up all of the country's forest reserves to commercial use.

 nevertheless, between the early 1950s and 1981, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was able to boost the total <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of its forests by some 2.

 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> has top levels of economic freedom in many <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s, although there is a heavy tax burden and inflexible job market.

 recently, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> has topped the patents per capita statistics, and overall productivity growth has been strong in <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s such as electronics.

road transport in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> is the most popular method of transportation, particularly in rural <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s where the railway network does not extend to.

 if no other speed limit is signposted, the general speed limit in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> is   in built-up <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s and   outside.

until the mid 20th century, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was a predominantly agrarian society, and the names of west finns were based on their association with a particular <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, farm, or homestead, e.

similar projects have been undertaken in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, which requires all buildings with <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> over 600 m² to have an nbc (nuclear-biological-chemical) shelter, and norway, which requires all buildings with an <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> over 1000 m² to have a shelter.

 strategically, the finnish territory was the less important northern section of the estonian–finnish gateway and a buffer zone to and from petrograd through the narva <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, the gulf of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and the karelian isthmus.

 the weakness of russia inspired an idea of greater <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> among the expansionist factions of both the right and left: the reds had claims concerning the same <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s.

 the leader of the german war effort, general erich ludendorff, wanted to keep petrograd under threat of attack via the vyborg-narva <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and to install a german-led monarchy in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 the neutral countries of austria, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and sweden acceded to the eu, and those that didn't join were tied into the eu's economic market via the european economic <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>.

 the city's urban <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> has a population of , making it by far the most populous urban <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> as well as the country's most important center for politics, education, finance, culture, and research; while tampere in the pirkanmaa region, located  to the north from helsinki, is the second largest urban <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 often considered to be <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s only metropolis, it is the world's northernmost metro <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> with over one million people as well as the northernmost capital of an eu member state.

according to a theory presented in the 1630s, at the time of swedish colonisation of coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, colonists from hälsingland in central sweden had arrived at what is now known as the vantaa river and called it helsingå ("helsinge river"), which gave rise to the names of helsinge village and church in the 1300s.

 people from other <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> might use hesa (short for helsinki).

 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, and the helsinki metro subway system was built.

 the helsinki urban <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> is considered to be the only metropolis in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

1 million, and is the most densely populated <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

the helsinki urban <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> is an officially recognized urban <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, defined by its population density.

 the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> stretches throughout 11 municipalities, and is the largest such <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, with a land <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of  and approximately 1.

 yle's studio <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> houses the  high television and radio tower, yle transmission tower (pasilan linkkitorni), which is the third tallest structure in helsinki and one of helsinki's most famous landmarks, from the top of which, in good weather, can be seen even as far as tallinn over the gulf of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 the army became the vehicle of upward social mobility for noble youths from non-russian <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s, such as poland, the baltic, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and georgia.

 after the finnish war in 1809, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was ceded to the russian empire (excluding the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of modern-day northern sweden where meänkieli dialects of finnish are spoken), making this <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> the autonomous grand duchy of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 in the peace settlement <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> ended up ceding a large part of karelia and some other <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s to the soviet union.

the last ice age in the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of the modern-day <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> ended c.

 starting about that time, people migrated to the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> from the south and south-east.

 the oldest confirmed evidence of the post-glacial human settlements in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> are from the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of ristola in lahti and from orimattila, from c.

 the earliest post-glacial inhabitants of the present-day <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> were probably mainly seasonal hunter-gatherers.

it is widely believed that finno-ugric (the western branch of the uralic) languages were first spoken in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and the adjacent <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s during the comb ceramic period, around 4000 bc at the latest.

 häkkinen propose that the finno-ugric languages arrived in the gulf of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> around 2000 bc or later in the bronze age, as result of an early bronze age uralic language expansion possibly connected to the seima-turbino phenomenon.

 at the time there can be seen three cultural <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s or tribes in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>: finns, tavastians and karelians.

 the original swedish term for the realm's eastern part was  ('eastern lands'), a plural, meaning the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> proper, tavastia, and karelia.

an important part of the 16th-century history of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was growth of the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> settled by the farming population.

meanwhile, the finnish <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s belonging to russia after the peace treaties in 1721 and 1743 (not including ingria), called "old <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>" were initially governed with the old swedish laws (a not uncommon practice in the expanding russian empire in the 18th century).

  the overall situation caused decline in the economy and morale in old <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, worsened since 1797 when the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> was forced to send men to the imperial army.

during the second world war, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> fought two wars against the soviet union: the winter war of 1939–1940, resulting in the loss of a portion of finnish karelia, and the continuation war of 1941–1944 (with considerable support from nazi germany resulting in a swift invasion of neighboring <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of the soviet union), eventually leading to the loss of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s only ice-free winter harbour petsamo.

 in october 1939, the soviet union sent the same kind of request to <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, but the finns refused to give any land <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s or military bases for the usage of the red army.

 the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> swedish minority is concentrated in the coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s and archipelagos of southern and western <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 the swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of ostrobothnia, southwest <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and nyland where the percentage of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> swedes partly is high, with swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on åland, where swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language.

 notable are the norwegian fjords, the scandinavian mountains covering much of norway and parts of sweden, the flat, low <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s in denmark and the archipelagos of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, norway and sweden.

 the republic of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> had a grievance against the soviet union because the red army had invaded southeastern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> in the winter war (1939–40) and had taken a large <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of territory away from <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 when the speakers of this language extended to the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of modern day <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, they encountered groups of peoples who spoke a number of smaller ancient languages, which later became extinct.

 lansman versus <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> concerned a challenge by sámi reindeer herders in northern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> to the finnish central forestry board's plans to approve logging and construction of roads in an <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> used by the herdsmen as winter pasture and spring calving grounds.

 in 1918 and 1919, finnish volunteers conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the soviet border, the viena and aunus expeditions, to annex karelian <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s according to the greater <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> ideology of combining all finnic peoples into a single state.

 he thought that the pro-<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> movement in karelia posed a direct threat to leningrad and that the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and defences of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> could be used to invade the soviet union or restrict fleet movements.

 in exchange, the soviet union would cede repola and porajärvi municipalities from eastern karelia, an <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> twice the size of the territory demanded from <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 the finns made two counteroffers whereby <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> would cede the terijoki <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> to the soviet union, which would double the distance between leningrad and the finnish border, far less than the soviets had demanded, as well as the islands in the gulf of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 the finnish command believed that the soviets would not attack there, but the red army committed two divisions to the kainuu <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of oulu and effectively cut <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> in two.

 the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> included <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s fourth-largest city of vyborg, much of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s industrialised territory, and significant land still held by <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s military — all in all, nine percent of finnish territory.

 overall, about 75% nesting attempts failed in western germany, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and the swedish baltic <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>.

 a considerable part of the remaining <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> populated by ingrian finns seceded from bolshevist russia as the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>-backed republic of north ingria, but was reintegrated with russia in the end of 1920 according to the conditions of the treaty of tartu.

 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was ruled by sweden at this time, and the swedish language became part of the culture in those coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s, as well as the language of the ruling classes.

the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> that today is <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> was an integral part of sweden proper from the middle ages to the end of the finnish war in 1809.

  negative opinions towards studying swedish are also grounded in the fact that mandatory swedish is taught throughout the country, even though there are few swedish-speakers in mainland <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> outside the coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> by the baltic sea.

 simultaneously the growth of population in sweden, together with lack of land, resulted in swedish settlements in southern and western coastal <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 helsinki (helsingfors in swedish and dominantly used until the late 19th century), named after medieval settlers from the swedish province of hälsingland, still mainly swedish speaking in the beginning of the 19th century, attracted finnish-speaking workers, civil servants and university students from other parts of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, as did other swedish-speaking <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s.

<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of modern-day <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> were integrated into the swedish realm in the 13th century, at a time when that realm was still in the process of being formed.

 orthodox parishes are believed to have existed as far to the west as tavastia, the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> inhabited by tavastians in central <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 however, in the remoter <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of eastern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and karelia, like ilomantsi, the eastern orthodox christianity survived.

 they also moved into the remote <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> building three small monasteries there.

in <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s where orthodox faith was not indigenous as in the towns of helsinki, tampere and viipuri and the karelian isthmus, orthodoxy was especially associated with the russians, most of whom were russian troops permanently stationed in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

virtually the entire karelian population of the ceded <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s, about 422,000 people, was evacuated to <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, and the territories were settled by peoples from other parts of the soviet union.

 the last storage was done in 987 when the entrance-hall was filled and the entrance-door closed and hidden, as foreign warlords would enter the baltic <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and - by the year 1050 - reaching and conquering the major cities of southern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 after the swedish conquest of the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> in 1617 the ingrian finns, descendants of 17th-century lutheran emigrants from present-day <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, became the majority in ingria.

 sweden's interest in the territory was mainly strategic: the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> served as a buffer zone against russian attacks on the karelian isthmus and on present-day <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, then the eastern half of the swedish realm; and russian baltic trade had to pass through swedish territory.

the centrist tradition of defending equal political and economic rights for peripheral <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s was reflected in the internal resistance that opposed chairman aho's ambitions to lead <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> to the eu.

russia would create the grand duchy of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> from the territory obtained from sweden, and would attach the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s gained from sweden in the 18th century (so-called old <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>) to the new grand duchy in 1812.

in nordic countries, like norway, sweden, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, and also estonia, all nature <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s are considered public space, due to a law, the allemansrätten (the right to common passage).

 it has been proposed that late proto-finnic evolved into three dialects: northern dialect, spoken in western <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>; southern dialect, spoken in the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of modern-day estonia and northern latvia, and eastern dialect, spoken in the regions east of the southern dialect.

 most countries use white, with a few – such as <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, iceland, poland, and sweden – opting for yellow as this tends to improve the winter-time visibility of signs in <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s where snow is prevalent.

 this means that in <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s like north-east sweden and northern <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> pre-existing landforms and deposits escaped glacier erosion and are particularly well preserved at present.

 while this winter fur is actually a very good camouflage in the coastal regions of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> where the snow covers the shrubs only a short time, the mountain hare is better adapted for the snowier conditions of the inland <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s.

during the state of war between <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and soviet russia (1918–1920) the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> around pechenga was occupied by the finnish forces, and as a result of the treaty of tartu in 1920 became a part of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> as petsamo.

because of the absence of an evenly applied, up-to-date legal system in the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, apathy in some ways dominated among old <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s residents; and not many figures from the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> have a prominent place in history.

 the importance of the murmansk railway, built in 1916, meant that the soviet delegation rejected the finnish border proposal and the treaty of 14 october 1920 recognised a border in which <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> obtained the northern port of petsamo (pechenga) an outlet to the arctic ocean and a border roughly the same as that of the former grand duchy of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, claims on <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s of eastern karelia were abandoned and the soviets accepted that the south-eastern border would not be moved west of petrograd.

 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s official stance is that the borders may be changed through peaceful negotiations, although there is currently no need to hold open talks, as russia has shown no intention of returning the ceded <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s, or discussing the question.

luther moved to michigan in 1952 and began working for <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> institute in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, where he was director of management and organization development retiring in 1981.

 when the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> sit-down strike threatened the production of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and its rivals in the american automobile industry.

 after the conclusion of the war, though, the housing shortage in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> became even more acute as workers flocked to the booming automobile plants, primarily those of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>.

 for example, in the early 1980s, an epidemic of tax protest swept <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> plants in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, michigan, as thousands of employees there told  to stop withholding income tax from their salaries after they attended seminars or listened to lectures on tape from the tax protester group "we the people act.

 when both were folded into the new <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (gm) in 1908, the company dominated <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s economy.

in october 1996, time warner acquired ted turner's <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves.

 his purchase of an <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> uhf station in 1970 began the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system.

the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves were sold by time warner (which had assumed control after the merger with <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>) to liberty media in 2007.

on march 31, 2004, the team was sold to a group of executives by the name of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> spirit llc by time warner (who inherited the hawks, braves and thrashers upon its merger with <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> in 1996).

prior to the launch of the channel in 1988, the turner network television name had been utilized by the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system for an ad hoc syndication service which produced and distributed various sporting events for carriage on turner's <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, georgia superstation wtbs (channel 17, now wpch-tv, which was separated from its national cable feed, tbs, in october 2007) as well as broadcast television stations throughout the united states.

) incidentally, the film was set and had its premiere held in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, turner's hometown and the headquarters of the channel's corporate parent, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system.

 the channel's operations were based inside office space at <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s techwood drive complex in midtown <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> that formerly served as the facilities for cnn headline news from its launch as cnn2 in january 1982 until it and parent network cnn moved their operations into the cnn center downtown in 1987.

 time warner did not have a station group of its own at the time (and still does not in the present day); although its <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system division did own <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> independent station wpch-tv (then wtbs-tv, the local feed of then-superstation tbs) at the time, but it never carried wb programming due to the network's affiliation with watl, which tribune broadcasting had owned from 1999 (when it acquired the station from qwest broadcasting, which was part-owned by tribune) to 2006 (when it sold the station to the gannett company, now tegna, inc.

many corporations are headquartered in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and its surrounding area, such as the coca-cola company, delta air lines, and the home depot, and also to many cable television networks, such as the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system (cnn, tbs, tnt, turner south, cartoon network) and the weather channel.

 on march 28, 2005, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>-based <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system began recording adult swim nielsen ratings separately from cartoon network for demographic purposes.

 the headquarters of turner's properties are located in both the cnn center in downtown <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, and the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> campus off techwood drive in midtown <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, which also houses turner studios.

 when it went on the air in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, the station was powered at only 3,000 watts, using the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> tower, which gave it a height above average terrain (haat) of less than 1,000 feet.

 in 1981, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> split the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> broadcast feed of wtbs from the satellite-delivered cable feed and began marketing the channel to cable providers as a "free market superstation".

 (the broadcast and cable feeds, however, simulcast one another with certain exceptions until october 2007, when <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> – which was acquired by time warner in 1996 – decided to separate the programming on both feeds, therefore making tbs a cable-exclusive entertainment network with a principal focus on comedy, and reformatting the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> signal under the wpch-tv call letters).

merrill left <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> briefly, moving to new jersey for a year and joining the programming department of boomerang, an asset of the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system.

 the omni complex office building was largely vacant until cnn moved its headquarters there in 1987 from its midtown <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> site (old home of the progressive club on 1050 techwood drive and home to <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system).

tbs was able to work around these issues by supplementing its <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>-originated sports broadcasts with more nationalized sports fare, including a package of regular season nba games involving the league's other teams, early round conference playoff games and the nba draft (beginning with the 1984–85 season and continuing until <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> shifted the nba cable rights to sister channel tnt in 2002), professional wrestling programs from several promotions (including georgia championship wrestling, the world wrestling federation [now the wwe], jim crockett promotions, mid-south wrestling and finally, the turner-owned world championship wrestling) until 2001, ncaa college football games (from 1981 to 1992 and from 2002 to 2007 season), various nascar auto races and the olympics-inspired goodwill games.

in 1978, ted turner, then operator of wtcg in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, georgia, wanted to use the call letters "wtbs" (for <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system).

after his 29 may 1980 radio show, jensen left the bbc to work for the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system wtbs cable superstation in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, georgia, where he was host of the 10:00pm nightly news.

<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system stepped in and raised the money needed to purchase scitrek's challenger learning center, which was relocated and donated to <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s fernbank science center.

 by 1995, the school became known as the wcw power plant and relocated again, this time to <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> where <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (the parent company of wcw) was headquartered.

 it also carried telecasts of professional sporting events from the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves major league baseball, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> hawks nba, and <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> thrashers nhl franchises, all of which were owned by the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system at the network's launch.

southern satellite systems was founded in 1976 in tulsa, oklahoma, and was formed for the sole purpose of distributing wtcg (later wtbs), an <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> uhf television station (<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>) nationwide via satellite.

in 1980 hickman joined the young cable television company <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system (tbs) in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, georgia, working with nick charles as part of a four-person sports department for the company's cable news network cnn.

 it also sold wkrc radio to jacor and shut down electra, a teletext service operated as a joint venture between taft, zenith, and <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s wtbs (now wpch-tv) in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>.

 this angered wtbs owner ted turner, who believed mcmahon reneged on a promise to have live matches originating from <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system's <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> studios.

 ted turner, 1956, founder of cnn and <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system, former owner of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> hawks, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> thrashers

channel 17 was a longtime broadcaster of major league baseball games featuring the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves under former parent <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s in-house sports production firm, tbs sports (later renamed turner sports).

 his most notable moment during this time came during an interview with baseball legend hank aaron, who was working for the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves at the time and was informed by madden of the employment of "cowboy" bill watts by world championship wrestling, then a sister company to the braves via their common ownership by <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system.

 fittingly, one of the teams involved was the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> falcons, based in the home city of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> - <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, georgia (they played at their division rivals, the carolina panthers, located up interstate 85 in charlotte, north carolina).

 in 1988, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> promoted clayton to corporate vice president for urban affairs, assigning her to direct turner projects and serve as a liaison between <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and civic groups in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and throughout the country.

 nadeau returned for the 1999 season, with <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> taking a larger role in its sponsorship duties, advertising tbs, dinner and a movie, wcw, and the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves in addition to their cartoon network sponsorship.

   the initial price of using one of the 24 transponders— $35,000 per month— inspired the creation of new cable television networks, such as espn, and the transformation of local tv stations into nationwide "superstations", including <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s wtgc becoming the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system.

 ted turner began the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> in 1970 with his takeover of wjrj-tv, renamed wtcg in 1970 and wtbs in 1979; wtbs became a pioneer "superstation" distributed to cable operators internationally, eventually yielding tbs.

<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> braves baseball games had been a local staple on <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> independent station wtbs (channel 17, now wpch-tv; which, like tbs, was owned by ted turner's <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system) since turner acquired the team's broadcast rights in 1973, and subsequently gained national prominence when the station was uplinked to satellite in december 1976, becoming one of america's first superstations.

 as a part of the deal, the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system management decided to limit braves games to local telecasts within the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> market.

 on october 1, 2007, the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system severed the ties between wtbs and the tbs cable channel, converting the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> station into an in-market independent station that assumed the call letters wpch-tv, branding on-air as "peachtree tv".

 time warner did acquire <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> independent station wtbs (which served as the originating feed of then-superstation tbs) through its 1996 merger with the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system; however, watl (which tribune would acquire in 1999) served as the wb affiliate for that market throughout the network's run.

in advance of transforming his <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> uhf television station into the nucleus of a worldwide cable television network, ted turner changed the call letters of wtcg channel 17 to wtbs, for <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system, transmitted by satellite communication at low cost to u.

however, tribune was the only one of the two companies involved in the wb that owned any stations aligned with the network as time warner did not own any television stations at the network's launch and would not own one until its 1996 merger with the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> system, owners of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> superstation wtbs (channel 17, now wpch-tv; its national feed, tbs, is now a separate basic cable channel).

 the new network immediately signed 10-year affiliation agreements with 16 stations affiliated with the wb (out of 19 stations that were affiliated with the network) that were owned by that network's part-owner, the tribune company – including stations in the coveted markets of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>, los angeles and chicago – and 11 upn stations that were owned by <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>.

due to factors including tribune broadcasting's decision not to have an ownership stake in the cw, subsequent affiliation changes, and tribune's 2019 sale to nexstar media group with accompanying divestments, the cw's stations in the three respective top markets (wpix, ktla and wciu) are actually affiliates of the network; <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> owns secondary stations – both independents – in two of the three markets, kcal-tv in los angeles and wlny-tv in the <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> market (however, while kcal was owned by cbs at the network's launch, wlny was not acquired by cbs until 2011; neither station carries cw programming, though, because of the network's affiliation deals with formerly tribune-owned stations in those markets, and in the latter case, wlny's over-the-air signal does not serve the entire <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> market – resulting in most residents in the metropolitan area receiving the station mainly through cable or satellite – due to being licensed to the long island community of riverhead, restricting its transmitter from being located more than  from its city of license under fcc regulations).

 because of the tradeoffs, stations owned by <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> through its cbs television stations subsidiary (which include owned-and-operated stations of cbs and the cw, and some independent stations) generally opted not to carry digital subchannels and transmitted only a 1080i high definition main feed; this changed in 2013 with the addition of dedicated local news channels on cbs o&os in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and philadelphia (the company later announced the creation of decades, a multicast network part-owned by cbs which aired on all cbs and cw owned-and-operated stations from 2015 to 2018).

originally slated to debut at the november 1972 <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> motor show, the x1/9's launch was delayed until after the show to avoid upstaging the new <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> 126 city car.

 the car's monocoque body was produced at the bertone factory in grugliasco (<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>) and then transported to the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s lingotto factory for final assembly.

in january 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s plans to move production from plants in cassino, sulmona and termini imerese to <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> and desio.

 the decision to manufacture the car in italy, instead of manufac<PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>g it with the cheaper workforce in tychy, poland, was taken because of the agreement between italian prime minister mario monti and <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> directors not to close down any of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s plants in italy.

 however, the development in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>'s architecture came after 1748 with the construction of the sveaborg fortress - nowadays a world heritage site - (first planned by augustin ehrensvärd) on a group of islands just off the coast from <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED>; the heart of the fortress was a dockyard, but distinct baroque architecture as well as an english-st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> landscape park were placed within the otherwise unsymmetrical fortification system, all built in stone and brick, and many of the "windows" in the classical facade compositions were in fact painted on.

 among his varied works, he designed new baroque-st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> town plans for the towns of pori (1852), mariehamn (åland) (1859) and uusikaupunki (1856), an english-st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> romantic landscape park for seinäjoki (1858), neo-gothic churches for lovisa (1865) and uusikaupunki (1864), rundbogenstil-neo-gothic lovisa town hall and the house of nobility in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1862), neo-renaissance nya teatern, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1853, burnt down 1863) as well as redbrick factory buildings in littoinen, turku, forssa and tampere and various rustic villas for private clients.

 one of his most famous works, the redbrick erottaja fire station, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1891) is seen as a mixture of neo-gothic and neo-renaissance st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>s modelled on giotto's campanile in florence and the tower of the medieval palazzo vecchio also in florence.

 his buildings are typical of the eclecticism of the time, designing in both gothic revival st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and a so-called neo-renaissance st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> of classicism, with heavy ornamentation as well as heavy use of colour in interiors but also occasionally in facades, as for instance with his house of the estates, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1891).

 after graduating at the polytechnical institute, usko nyström (no relation) had continued his studies at the école des beaux-arts in paris in 1890–91; on returning to finland he initially designed (from 1895 to 1908 in the partnership usko nyström-petrelius-penttilä) neo-renaissance architecture - in particular gaining from the growth area of building speculation in middle-class apartment buildings in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> - whilst also developing a more jugendstil st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> inspired by national romanticism, and politically by the pro-independence fennoman movement.

 the more prominent buildings of this national romantic st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> were built in stone, but the discovery in finland of deposits of soapstone, an easily carved metamorphic rock, overcame the difficulty of using only hard granite; an example of this is the facade of the pohjola insurance building, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1901) by gesellius, lindgren, and saarinen.

 the jugendstil st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> was used by gesellius, lindgren, and saarinen in key state buildings such as the national museum and <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> railway station.

 other key buildings built in this st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> were the finnish language adult education centre in <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1927) by taucher (with key assistance from p.

 blomstedt), vyborg art museum and drawing school (1930) by uno ullberg, "taidehalli" art gallery, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1928) and töölö church, <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1930) by hilding ekelund, and several buildings by alvar aalto, in particular the workers' club, jyväskylä (1925), the south-west finland agricultural building, turku (1928), muuramäki church (1929) and the early version of the vyborg library (1927–1935) before aalto greatly modified his design in line with the emerging functionalist st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>.

but beyond these public buildings designed in the nordic classicism st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, this same st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> was also used in timber constructed workers' housing, most famously in the puu-käpylä ("wooden käpylä") district of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1920–1925) by martti välikangas.

 a challenge to the traditional urbanisation process came, however, with the design of "forest towns", high-rise developments set in forested areas on the outskirts of the major cities, such as the pihlajamäki suburb of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> (1959–1965), based on a town plan by olli kivinen, and building designs by lauri silvennoinen, the area comprising white functionalist-st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> 9-storey tower blocks and up to 250-metre-long 4–5-storey "lamella" blocks dispersed within a forest setting.

the former industrial, dockyard and shipbuilding areas of <PLACE_FOUNDED>[Y]</PLACE_FOUNDED> are being replaced by new housing areas, designed mostly in a minimalist-functionalist st<COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> as well as new support services such as kindergartens and schools (which, for the sake of efficiency, are also intended for use as neighbourhood communal facilities; e.
