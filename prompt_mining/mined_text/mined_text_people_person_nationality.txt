 [Y]: radio farda interview with dissident [X]

 changing [Y]: may 2008 interview with [X] (interviewed by rebecca tuhus-dubrow, associate editor of boston review books)

hassan moghaddas, 42, [Y]ian judge in the case of [X] and high-profile cases; assassinated by unknown motorbike assailant.

he had been named by [X] as "having encouraged or issued fatwas, or religious orders" for the 1998 chain murders assassinations of five [Y]ian dissidents.

another hypothesis offered by [Y]ians ([X], arzoo osanloo, hooman majd) is that "notions of democracy and human rights have taken root among the [Y]ian people" making it "much more difficult for the government to commit crimes" than the shah's government did ([X]).

but according to dissident [X], what might appear to be "extra-legal" killings in [Y] are actually not outside the penal code of the islamic republic since the code "authorises a citizen to assassinate another if he is judged to be 'impious'".

 moreover, [X] took a tour around the world in order to invite non [Y]ian intellectuals to join [Y]'s intellectual movement.

 soltani, along with seifzadeh, ebadi and others, also represented jailed journalist [X] during his imprisonment and long hunger strike and imprisoned [Y]ian-american academic haleh esfandiari.

[X], [Y]ian journalist 

at about the same time, [X] attended the [Y] after the elections conference in berlin.

during the 1990s, [X] had discovered crucial links that connected the chain murders of [Y] to the reigning neoconservative clergymen (ali fallahian, gholam hossein mohseni-ejehei, mohammad taghi mesbah-yazdi) who had issued the fatwas legitimizing assassinations of secular humanists and religious modernists.

2007 - [X], [Y]

 among them, many film directors like jafar panahi (who was consequently banned from making movies for 20 years and condemned to six years imprisonment), mohammad rasoulof (also condemned to 6 years imprisonment), actors and actresses like pegah ahangarani (who was consequently imprisoned), ramin parchami (who was consequently condemned to one year imprisonment), sportsmen like the whole [Y] national football team who wore green wristbands in their game against south korea to support the movement, scholars like mostafa tajzadeh, mohsen aminzadeh, [X], mohsen sazegara, many religious figures like mohsen kadivar, grand ayatollah yousef saanei, grand ayatollah sayyid ali mohammad dastgheib shirazi, traditional singers like mohammad reza shajarian, defected basij and [Y]ian revolutionary guards like amir farshad ebrahimi and those who confessed with covered faces.

 notable [Y]ians who believe he did not include mohammad taghi mesbah yazdi (a senior cleric and main theorist of [Y]ian ultraconservatives who opposes democracy), [X] (a pro-democracy activist and writer who is against islamic government) and abdolkarim soroush (an [Y]ian philosopher in exile),  according to reza parsa writing in the state-run aftab news.

[X], celebrated islamic revolutionary turned investigative journalist, and editor of fath (victory) newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, to be followed by five years in exile (later reduced to six years imprisonment and no exile) for "retaining classified documents from the culture and islamic guidance ministry, insulting the former leader of the islamic republic of [Y], ayatollah khomeini, and disseminating propaganda against the islamic system.

 however, conference attendee and political prisoner [X] has cast doubt on this charge, pointing out that [Y]ians could not go to the conference without the authorities permission, and that the authorities themselves had received the leader of the allegedly zionist-controlled green party, joschka fischer.

baghi and [X] are credited with uncovering the responsibility of [Y]ian security personnel for the chain murders, in which a number of dissident intellectuals were found murdered, apparently by a serial killer.

explanations for why this is include the importance of "debate and discussion" among clerics in shiite islam that has spilled over into the [Y]ian public (journalist elaine sciolino), and that "notions of democracy and human rights" now have much deeper roots among [Y]ians than under the shah ([X], arzoo osanloo, hooman majd),  in fact are "almost hegemonic" (arzoo osanloo), so that it is much harder to spread fear among them, even to the point that if [Y]ian intelligence services "were to arrest anyone who speaks ill of the government in private, they simply couldn't build cells fast enough to hold their prisoners" (journalist hooman majd).

 [Y]ian journalist and writer, [X], spearheaded the strike to call for the release of all those who have been arrested in [Y] following the protests.

  according to [X], "notions of democracy and human rights have taken root among the [Y]ian people" making it "much more difficult for the government to commit crimes.

  he brought to mit such [Y]ian luminaries as president mohammad khatami, former deputy foreign minister abbas maleki, former reform parliamentarian fatemeh haghighatjoo, and dissident [X].

on 12 july 2005 while he was taking photos of some students gathered in front of tehran university supporting [X], he was attacked by some [Y]ian security forces with civilian clothes and his camera and equipment were broken.

 likewise, dissident journalist and former political prisoner [X] expressed hope, "step-by-step nuclear accords, the lifting of economic sanctions and the improvement of the relations between [Y] and western powers will gradually remove the warlike and securitized environment from [Y].

 judge moghaddasi also presided over the trials of [Y]ian political dissidents, such as [X].

 journalists and human rights advocates in [Y] who attempt to raise awareness of these issues often risk imprisonment and the death sentence themselves, such as in the case of [X].

the history of the communist movement in [Y] can be divided into six phases, namely the emergence before world war ii of the indochinese communist party (icp), whose members were almost exclusively vietnamese; the 10-year struggle for independence from the french, when a separate [Y]n communist party, the kampuchean (or khmer) people's revolutionary party (kprp), was established under vietnamese auspices; the period following the second party congress of the kprp in 1960, when saloth sar gained control of its apparatus; the revolutionary struggle from the initiation of the khmer rouge insurgency in 1967–1968 to the fall of the [X] government in april 1975; the democratic kampuchea regime from april 1975 to january 1979; and the period following the third party congress of the kprp in january 1979, when hanoi effectively assumed control over [Y]'s government and communist party.

 before [X]'s coup d'état and the establishment of its anti-communist military regime, [Y] was ruled by the authoritarian royal norodom sihanouk since [Y]n independence from france in the 1950s.

1970 – [X] ousts prince norodom sihanouk of [Y].

[X] (1913–1985) was prime minister of [Y].

in march 1970, while sâr was in beijing, [Y]n parliamentarians led by [X] deposed sihanouk when he was out of the country.

 he stressed to lê duẩn that while he wanted the vietnamese to supply the khmer rouge with weapons, he did not want troops: the [Y]ns needed to oust [X] themselves.

 north vietnamese armies, in collaboration with the viet cong, nevertheless invaded [Y] to attack [X]'s forces; in turn, south vietnam and the united states sent troops to the country to bolster his government.

 by the end of the year, marxist forces had a presence in over half of [Y]; the khmer rouge played a restricted role in this, for throughout 1971 and 1972, the majority of fighting against [X] was carried out by vietnamese or by [Y]ns under vietnamese control.

in march 1970, prince sihanouk was deposed by his pro-american prime minister [X], who demanded that north vietnamese troops leave [Y] or face military action.

  [X] began rounding up vietnamese civilians in [Y] into internment camps and massacring them, provoking harsh reactions from both the north vietnamese and south vietnamese government.

marshal [X] (, also ; 13 november 1913 – 17 november 1985) was a [Y]n politician and general who served as prime minister of [Y] twice (1966–67; 1969–71), as well as serving repeatedly as defence minister and provincial governor.

 it seems likely that in setting in motion the events leading up to the coup, [X] initially intended to strengthen his position against the north vietnamese with the ultimate aim of preventing their troops (and those of the viet cong) from operating within [Y]n borders, and wished to apply pressure on sihanouk to achieve this.

 on 12 march, [X] and sirik matak closed the port of sihanoukville, through which weapons were being smuggled to the viet cong, to the north vietnamese and issued an ultimatum: all north vietnamese and viet cong forces were to withdraw from [Y]n soil within 72 hours or face military action.

 two months later, [X] left [Y] to seek medical treatment, leaving sirik matak to run the government.

 zhou greeted sihanouk very warmly, telling him that china still recognized him as the legitimate leader of [Y] and would be pressuring north korea, along with several middle eastern and african nations, not to recognize [X]'s government, saying that once china issued its declaration of support, "the soviet union will be embarrassed and will have to reconsider".

 he encouraged the [Y]n populace to join him and fight against [X]'s government.

khmer rouge soldiers broadcast sihanouk's message in the [Y]n countryside, which roused demonstrations rooting for his cause that were brutally suppressed by [X]'s troops.

the new [Y]n leader [X] had supported the [Y]n "incursion" through he had not been consulted in advance, and as a result, the north vietnamese increased their support for the khmer rouge guerrillas who were fighting to overthrow him.

, south vietnamese and laotian forces began to feel the north vietnamese reaction to general [X]'s coup in [Y] and the subsequent closure of the port of sihanoukville to its supply shipments.

 despite this assault, many of the communist forces escaped westward, deeper into [Y], or to the rural areas of the north-east, where they would provide support for the insurgency against [X].

[X]'s immediate reaction was to condemn the action as a violation of [Y]n territory.

 when haig told him that american ground forces would not be used to assist the [Y]n army, and that (in accordance with the nixon doctrine) a programme of aid would be given instead, [X] openly wept.

 sirik matak had been acting prime minister during the republic's first year, when [X]'s health had been extremely poor, but had engendered considerable resentment due to his administrative style and royal connections; there was also growing frustration amongst young, urban [Y]ns at the continued corruption and inefficiency of the regime.

 following sihanouk's march 1970 deposition by pro-american general [X], who ordered the north vietnamese to leave [Y], north vietnam attempted to overrun all of [Y] following negotiations with nuon chea, the second-in-command of the [Y]n communists (dubbed the khmer rouge) fighting to overthrow the [Y]n government.

 the [X] government in phnom penh surrendered on 17 april 1975, just five days after the us mission evacuated [Y].

 the prince also feared that a number of high-ranking, rightist fark officers led by [X] were becoming too powerful and that, by association with these officers, united states influence in [Y] was becoming too deeply rooted.

the history of the communist movement in [Y] can be divided into six phases: the emergence of the indochinese communist party (icp), whose members were almost exclusively vietnamese, before world war ii; the ten-year struggle for independence from the french, when a separate [Y]n communist party, the kampuchean (or khmer) people's revolutionary party (kprp), was established under vietnamese auspices; the period following the second party congress of the kprp in 1960, when saloth sar (pol pot after 1976) and other future khmer rouge leaders gained control of its apparatus; the revolutionary struggle from the initiation of the khmer rouge insurgency in 1967-68 to the fall of the [X] government in april 1975; the democratic kampuchea regime, from april 1975 to january 1979; and the period following the third party congress of the kprp in january 1979, when hanoi effectively assumed control over [Y]'s government and communist party.

 second, for the peasantry, the name of [X] became associated with ruthless repression throughout [Y].

 [X]'s call for 10,000 volunteers to boost the manpower of [Y]'s poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits.

in the wake of the coup, [X] did not immediately launch [Y] into war.

 despite nixon's appreciation of [X]'s position, the [Y]n leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country.

with the end of us involvement in south vietnam, the 354th tfw, deployed at korat, began flying combat sorties in [Y] to support the [X] government in support of khmer national armed forces against the khmer rouge.

as the united states began project gunship ii and project gunship iii, many of the remaining ac-47ds were transferred to the republic of vietnam air force, the royal lao air force, and [Y]'s khmer air force, after prince norodom sihanouk was deposed in a coup by general [X].

after the [Y]n coup of 1970, and the subsequent establishment of the khmer republic under [X], sihanouk was to join with his former communist enemies in forming the grunk, a beijing-based government-in-exile.

 during the 1970 [Y]n coup d'état by [X], sihamoni remained in czechoslovakia.

 during the [X] regime (1970–1975) and pol pot regime (1975–1979), many vietnamese living in [Y] were killed.

sirik matak was mainly notable for his involvement in [Y]n politics, particularly for his involvement in the 1970 right-wing coup against his cousin, then prince norodom sihanouk, and for his subsequent establishment, along with [X], of the khmer republic.

on 12 march 1970, while sihanouk was on a trip abroad, sirik matak canceled sihanouk's trade agreements and [X] demanded that all north vietnamese and nlf troops leave [Y] by dawn on march 15.

 whereas [X] was particularly popular amongst anti-sihanouk students in [Y]n cities, sirik matak had the support of the westernised urban 'elite'; rural [Y]ns remained overwhelmingly pro-sihanouk.

on 12 april 1975, united states ambassador to [Y] john gunther dean offered high officials of the khmer republic political asylum in the united states, but sirik matak, long boret and lon non, along with other members of [X]'s cabinet, declined - despite the names of boret and sirik matak being published by the khmer rouge in a list of "seven traitors" marked for execution.

as documented in the soviet archives, nuon chea played a major role in negotiating the north vietnamese invasion of [Y] in 1970, with the intent of forcing the collapse of [X]'s government: "in april–may 1970, many north vietnamese forces entered [Y] in response to the call for help addressed to vietnam not by pol pot, but by his deputy nuon chea.

 march 18: [X] takes power in [Y] and establishes the khmer republic.

 november 18: united states' aid to [Y] to support the [X] regime begins.

 during the [X] regime of [Y], the dance tradition was referred to as lakhon kbach boran khmer (, lit.

 that opportunity was provided by the overthrow of [Y]'s prince sihanouk by the pro-american general [X].

 the [Y]n civil war would escalate with the prc backed khmer rouge (also backed by the exiled sihanouk), fighting [X]'s central government.

it also marked the change of [Y] involvement in the vietnam war, as [X] issued an ultimatum to north vietnamese forces to leave [Y].

 in particular, the nationalist and anti-communist sensibilities of [X] and his associates meant that sihanouk's policy of semi-toleration of viet cong and people's army of vietnam (pavn) activity within [Y]n borders was unacceptable; sihanouk, during his swing to the left in 1963–66, had negotiated a secret arrangement with hanoi whereby in return for the guaranteed purchase of rice at inflated prices, the port of sihanoukville was opened for weapons shipments to the viet cong.

 on 12 march, sirik matak cancelled sihanouk's trade agreement with north vietnam; [X] closed the port of sihanoukville to the north vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them: all pavn and viet cong forces were to withdraw from [Y]n soil within 72 hours (on 15 march) or face military action.

 [X]'s appointee as deputy prime minister, prince sisowath sirik matak – a us-friendly nationalist and leader of the [Y]n business community – is thought to have suggested that sihanouk should be assassinated, though [X] rejected this plan as "criminal insanity".

 attacks against vietnamese began after a demand by [X] that all vietnamese communists leave [Y].

 these events marked the start of the [Y]n civil war, pitting [X]'s regime backed by us air power against the khmer rouge and north vietnam.

 [X] fled [Y] in 1975 right before the khmer rouge's seizure of power.

the chinese-made landmines in [Y] were placed by the [Y]n factions (including the [X], khmer rouge, the heng samrin and hun sen regimes, as well as the coalition government of democratic kampuchea who, with international support retained the un seat throughout much of the 1980s) which clashed during the civil war in [Y] in the 1970s and 1980s.

 carpet bombing of [Y] was partly responsible for the rise of what had been a small-scale khmer rouge insurgency, which now grew capable of overthrowing the [X] government .

being essentially a continuation of the old royal armed forces under a new name, the fank played a more partisan role in the [Y]n civil war that escalated following the deposition as head of state of prince norodom sihanouk by a coup d’état in march 1970 orchestrated by his own prime-minister general [X].

 [X], for example, served as commander of the [Y]n police under the french protectorate.

 [X] automatically succeeded the latter as head of state on august 18, and although he claimed that the move was constitutionally legal, it quickly ran afoul of the conservative mentality of the [Y]ns, many of whom believed that the prince ruled through divine favour.

  the outcome was that the period of [X]'s rule actually saw an increase of north vietnamese military presence in the lower mekong and bassac corridors and in the north and northeast [Y], particularly from 1972 onwards.

  in addition, many politically moderate [Y]ns came to dislike [X]'s authoritarian (and unstable) republican regime, due to his corrupt ways and oppressive rule that curbed political and civil rights far more than sihanouk had done.

  the fank was already placed at a strategic disadvantage since may 1970, following the seizure of the northeastern areas of the country (the provinces of stung treng, ratanakiri, kratie, and mondulkiri) by the nva in response to the [X] ultimatum and the loss to the khmer rouge of several peripheral eastern and southwestern [Y]n provinces (kampot, koh kong, kampong cham, preah vihear, plus portions of siem reap, oddar meanchey, kampong thom, prey veng, and svay rieng provinces) during that same year.

 upon [X]'s coup in march 1970, the [Y]n military establishment was renamed fank, thus becoming the official armed forces of the new regime, the khmer republic.

 sangkum was the only legal party in [Y] from 1955 to 1970 until a military coup by marshal [X].

in march 1970 the [Y]n government of [X] ended the policy of ignoring the vietnamese presence in the country.

 with the political changes in the us during 1974, and the resignation of president nixon, the air power of the united states at its thailand bases did not respond to the collapse of the [X] government to the khmer rouge in [Y] during april 1975 nor to the takeover of laos by the pathet lao.

 continued unrest spurred prime minister/defense minister [X] to close the port of sihanoukville to communist supplies and to issue an ultimatum on 12 march to the north vietnamese to withdraw their forces from [Y] within 72 hours.

on 18 march, the [Y]n national assembly removed sihanouk and named [X] as provisional head of state.

 like many other khmer nationalists, [X] had not forgotten the southern half of vietnam was part of the khmer empire until the 18th century nor had he forgiven the vietnamese for conquering an area that historically was part of [Y].

though [Y] had a weak army, [X] had given hanoi 48 hours to pull its forces out of [Y] and began the hasty training of 60,000 volunteers to fight the pavn/vc.

 [X] saw [Y]'s population of 400,000 ethnic vietnamese as possible hostages to prevent pavn attacks and ordered their roundup and internment.

 [X] encouraged pogroms against the vietnamese minority and the [Y]n police took the lead in organizing the pogroms.

 realizing that he had lost control of the situation, [X] did a volte-face and suddenly declared [Y]'s "strict neutrality".

 on 14 april 1970, [X] appealed for help, saying that [Y] was on the verge of losing its independence.

 by april 1970, the pavn/khmer rouge offensive in [Y] was going well and they had taken all five of [Y]'s northeastern provinces and kissinger predicated to nixon that the [X] regime would not survive 1970 on its own.

 by the order of nixon, the state department did not notify the [Y]n desk at the us embassy, saigon, the phnom penh embassy, or [X] of the planning.

 [X] complained the invasion had not helped as it only pushed the pavn/vc forces deeper into [Y] and broke down in tears when haig told him that the americans would be withdrawing from [Y] in june.

 [X] had requested that the arvn help in the retaking of kampong speu, a town along route 4 southwest of phnom penh and  inside [Y].

large numbers of vietnamese catholics emigrated upon the start of [X]'s military junta (the khmer republic) in 1970, with [Y]'s major seminary closed indefinitely, though catholics in general were tolerated by the government.

 there were two suggested theories about these defections: the first was that son ngoc thanh had order five hundred men to defect so that the khmer serei could infiltrate the [Y]n forces and subvert sihanouk's government; the second was that the defectors were actually employed by the cia in order to reinforce [X] and his forces when they made their move to depose sihanouk.

 the rationale to these defections were never explained by the cia or thanh; however, these defectors did support [X]'s government to fight against the north vietnamese forces based in [Y].

 they were effectively used by [X] to reinforce his own forces and later used to strengthen the [Y]n army in its battle against the north vietnamese and khmer rouge.

however, in the same year, thanh formally announced the dissolution of the khmer serei organisation and pledged support to the [X] government, and was made special councilor to [X] and later as prime minister of [Y].

 after the [Y]n military and [X] overthrew sihanouk in 1970, thanh was invited to participate in the new khmer republic government - initially as an adviser to the acting head of state, cheng heng - and put his khmer serei troops at its service.

following the overthrow of the [Y]n head of state, prince norodom sihanouk, in a coup d'état in march 1970 and its replacement by the pro-us khmer republic, the re-christened khmer national armed forces (fank) focused on expelling all people's army of vietnam (pavn) and viet cong (vc) forces from their border sanctuaries in eastern [Y] after the new president of the khmer republic, marshal [X], issued an ultimatum.

other scholars have detailed how the lubang buaya myth allowed the army to blame the pki for the murder of the six generals – thereby giving then lieutenant general [X], the opportunity to claim that the [Y]n military had the “sacred duty of protecting the country” by eliminating all pki members and supporters.

[X] *–  2nd president of [Y]

the new order (, abbreviated orba) is the term coined by the second [Y]n president [X] to characterise his regime as he came to power in 1966.

immediately following the attempted coup in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the [X]'s new order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from [Y]'s problems since its independence.

 among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced [X] to resign in the 1998 [Y]n revolution and then gained power, the term "new order" has come to be used pejoratively.

having been appointed president, [X] still needed to share power with various elements including [Y]n generals who considered [X] as mere primus inter pares as well as islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-communist purge.

while many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (angkatan 66) were successfully co-opted into the regime, it faced large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of the 1971 elections, the golput movement, the costly construction of taman mini [Y] indah theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists (malari incident of 1974), and the lack of term limits of [X]'s presidency (1978).

[X] proceeded with social engineering projects designed to transform [Y]n society into a de-politicized "floating mass" supportive of the national mission of "development", a concept similar to corporatism.

 in 1966 to 1967, to promote assimilation of the influential chinese [Y]ns, the [X] government passed several laws as part of the so-called "basic policy for the solution of chinese problem", whereby only one chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, chinese schools were phased out, and the ethnic chinese were encouraged to take [Y]n-sounding names.

by the 1990s, elements of the growing [Y]n middle class, created by [X]'s economic development, were becoming restless with his autocracy and his family's brazen corruption, fuelling demands for "reformasi" (reform) of the 30-year-old new order system.

 [X] (born 1926), czech-[Y]i holocaust historian

[X] (; born april 6, 1926) is an [Y]i historian and scholar of the holocaust.

in a 1998 essay, the [Y]i historian [X] called hillgruber as a "great german historian" who "unfortunately" in the 1980s "unwittingly" and "unwillingly" allowed himself to be associated with the fraction of german historians centered on ernst nolte.

 [Y]i historian [X] alleged that

 [Y]i historian [X] has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from hitler for the genocide carried out during the holocaust.

[X], czech-born [Y]i historian of the holocaust

czechoslovak–[Y]i historian [X], stated: "let us be clear: … shoah, churban, judeocide, whatever we call it, is the name we give to the attempted planned total physical annihilation of the jewish people, and its partial perpetration with the murder of most of the jews of europe.

oscar krasniansky of the jewish council, who translated the report into german as vrba and wetzler were writing and dictating it, made conflicting statements about the report after the war, according to [Y]i historian [X].

 his opinions concerning the inclusion of both the disabled and the romani as victims of the holocaust often gave rise to intense debates with other scholars, such as the [Y]i historian [X], who argued that only jews should be considered victims of the holocaust.

the [Y]i historian [X] argued that while the council knew that being sent to poland meant severe danger for jews, at that stage they did not know about the final solution it is true, bauer wrote, that jewish council members, under karol hochberg, head of the council's "department for special tasks", had worked with the ss, offering secretarial and technical help to draw up lists of jews to be deported (lists supplied by the slovak government).

 in 1996 vrba repeated the allegations in an article, "die mißachtete warnung: betrachtungen über den auschwitz-bericht von 1944" ("the warning that was ignored: considerations of an auschwitz report from 1944") in vierteljahrshefte für zeitgeschichte, to which the [Y]i historian [X] responded in 1997 in the same journal.

 it featured welcoming remarks by former under-secretary general for communications and public information shashi tharoor; a videotaped message by former secretary-general kofi annan; statements by the permanent representatives of [Y] and brazil to the united nations, and by gerda weissmann klein, holocaust survivor, author and historian gerda and kurt klein foundation; narration of photographs of holocaust victims memorialized on "pages of testimony" in the hall of names at yad vashem, jerusalem; as well as a performance by the zamir chorale of boston; and a lecture by professor [X], academic advisor to yad vashem, and the task force for international cooperation on holocaust education, remembrance and research.

the [Y]i historian [X] wrote that goldhagen's thesis about a murderous antisemitic culture applied better to romania than to germany and murderous anti-semitism was not confined to germany as goldhagen had claimed.

goldhagen's assertion that almost all germans "wanted to be genocidal executioners" has been viewed with skepticism by most historians, a skepticism ranging from dismissal as "not valid social science" to a condemnation, in the words of the [Y]i historian [X], as "patent nonsense".

recently, a synthesis of the two schools has emerged that has been championed by diverse historians such as the canadian historian michael marrus, the [Y]i historian [X], and the british historian ian kershaw that contends hitler was the driving force behind the holocaust, but that he did not have a long-term plan and that much of the initiative for the holocaust came from below in an effort to meet hitler's perceived wishes.

 [Y]i historian [X] suggests that possibly the prisoners of the family camp were being used as hostages pending a successful outcome of nazi–jewish negotiations, similar to a transport of 1,200 children from the białystok ghetto, who were held at theresienstadt for six weeks before being murdered on 7 october 1943 at auschwitz, but the only evidence of this is circumstantial.

 according to [Y]i historian [X], it is most likely that both the białystok children and the establishment of the theresienstadt family camp were connected to the feldscher proposal; in both cases the victims were temporarily kept alive in case they could be exchanged later, but murdered when the ransom failed to materialize.

 she wrote her 1984 master's thesis under the direction of [Y]i holocaust scholar [X], on the subject "the rescue of hasidic leaders in the holocaust era".

 the [Y]i historian [X] wrote that mayer "popularizes the nonsense that the nazis saw in marxism and bolshevism their main enemy, and the jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the jews to the ups and downs of german warfare in the soviet union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of holocaust denial".
