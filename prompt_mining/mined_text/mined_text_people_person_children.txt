the three steles (or tablets) of [Y] are in essence, three hymns written in adoration for the more abstract being, barbelo, from the perspective of the archetype of [Y] (“emmakha [Y]”) and his father [X] (or “ger[X]as”).

 the steles themselves were allegedly written by emmakha [Y], a spiritual archetype of [Y], the son of [X] and eve and founder of the gnostic race (immovable race, seed of [Y]), and thus are considered pseudepigraphic.

stele one assumes the voice of [Y], and then of [Y] together with ger[X]as praising their respective creators.

hymn 1: [Y]'s hymn to piger[X]as (the divine [X]) and autogenes (the self-generated)

emmakha [Y]’s praise of the ger[X]as is, as the title indicates a hymn dedicating to the glorifying of [Y]’s father, ger[X]as, better known as [X]as, or [X].

 the hymn is from the perspective of emmakha [Y], his spiritual archetype, and when he refers to ger[X]as he is likewise referring to [X]’s spiritual archetype which resides in the lowest realm within barbelo.

 he praises ger[X]s for creating him ([Y]) and praises “god” for creating ger[X]as.

 the actual lineage the author is likely referring to is that [X], was derived from barbelo, who resides over [X], [Y], and the rest of the lower realms, while barbelo itself was derived from the invisible parent.

praise of the barbelo takes on the voice of both ger[X]as and [Y] who are jointly praising barbelo since this is ultimately where they derive from and where they reside in their spiritual archetype forms.

stele 2 assumes the collective voices of [Y] and ger[X]s in praise of the barbelo.

hymn 3: praise of the barbelo begins on the second stele and continues to praise barbelo as both [Y] and ger[X]as, beginning with “masculine, virgin, first aeon…”  verse 121:20 this hymn tends to focus more on the barbelo and its prominent role being a self-reflection of the one.

 this hymn also takes on the voice of more than just [Y] and [X] (“we all praise you”)

 the silence referred to is the climax moment of contemplation in ascension, where the soul resides in the third and highest realm within barbelo, at which point the descension back to the first realm where [X] and [Y] reside begins, blessing the other realms on the way down.

 when she found [Y] teasing isaac, sarah told abraham to send both [Y] and [X] away.

early the next morning, abraham brought [X] and [Y] out together.

 this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by abraham when sarah demanded that he expel [X] and [Y].

 the book of genesis narrates that god promised [X] to beget from [Y] twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.

 sarah had to get [Y] (son of [X]) out of her house because, legally, [Y] would always be the first-born son even though isaac was her natural child.

 in genesis, these include three different accounts of a patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of abraham sending [X] and [Y] into the desert.

 through [X], abraham fathers [Y].

 sarah then drives [Y] and his mother [X] out into the wilderness (because [Y] is not her real son and [X] is a slave), but god saves them and promises to make [Y] a great nation.

 although this was abraham's second son (abraham's first son was [Y], with [X]) it was sarah's first and only child.

after isaac had been weaned, sarah saw [Y] mocking, and urged her husband to cast out [X] the bondservant and her son, so that isaac would be abraham's sole heir.

 paul contrasted isaac, symbolizing christian liberty, with the rejected older son [Y], symbolizing slavery; [X] is associated with the sinai covenant, while sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son isaac enters.

in the islamic view, the beginnings of mecca are attributed to the biblical figures, abraham, [X] and [Y].

 the civilization of mecca is believed to have started after ibrāhīm (abraham) left his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar ([X]) in the valley at allah's command.

 moses's mother, jochebed, being inspired to send the infant moses in a cradle down the nile river is a frequently cited example of inspiration, as is [X] searching for water for the infant [Y].

witnessed in the year 1800 bc with the arrival of the father of the prophets, prophet ibrahīm (the biblical abraham) to egypt during the occupation of the hyksos, and he married an egyptian slave girl named hajar (biblical [X]) from pelusium (modern-day northern qantara), and gave birth to prophet isma'īl (the biblical [Y]).

 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that [Y]ites chose to be called saracens in order to identify with abraham's "free" wife sarah, rather than as [X]enes, which would have highlighted their association with abraham's "slave woman" [X].

 the following year he exhibited his first work, [X] and [Y].

 when [Y] was grown, someone appeared to abraham in a dream and said to him: "keep your vow which you made! god bestowed upon you a boy by [X] so that you may sacrifice him" so he said to [Y]: "let us go offer a sacrifice to god!" so he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains.

 [Y] then said to him: "make tight my bonds, so that i will not struggle to pull back your clothes so that none of my blood will be shed on them for [X] will see it and be grieved.

 he replied: "by god, his actual intention is to sacrifice you!" he said: "why?!" iblis replied: "he claims that his lord has ordered him to do so!" [Y] replied: "he must do what his lord commands, absolutely!" when the young man had rebuffed him, iblis went to [X], the mother of [Y] who was still at home.

 certain episodes from the life of abraham have been more heavily detailed in islamic text, such as the arguments between abraham and the evil king, nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of [X] and [Y], which muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in mecca.

1659: abraham casting out [X] & [Y] – guilford college collection, greensboro, north carolina

the region, according to islamic tradition, is the birthplace of the islamic prophet muhammad, who was born in mecca, which is locally considered to have been founded by the islamic prophets abraham and [Y], and matriarch [X].

according to arab and islamic sources, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm (abraham) brought his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar ([X]) here, for the latter two to stay.

[X] and [Y]

 it was during this banquet that sarah happened upon the then teenaged [Y] mocking isaac and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and [X] be banished.

 [X] became pregnant with [Y].

 she would ultimately demand that abraham send [X] and [Y] away and so, abraham banished them and sent them into the desert.

 in genesis 17:15, god changes her name to sarah (princess) ("a woman of high rank") as part of the covenant with el shaddai after [X] bears abram his first born son [Y].

 however, notable differences exist in the portrayal of her relationships with abraham, [X], and [Y].

 she is not portrayed as abraham's sister but his first cousin, said to be the daughter of terah's brother, haran, and [X] is not portrayed as abraham's mistress but a second wife, eliminating the hostility that sarah feels for [X] during her pregnancy and toward [Y].

 in 1835, corot created a sensation at the salon with his biblical painting agar dans le desert ([X] in the wilderness), which depicted [X], sarah's handmaiden, and the child [Y], dying of thirst in the desert until saved by an angel.

 his chief earlier pictures have a religious interest, shown in such examples as the flight into egypt (1877), or [X] and [Y] (1880, luxembourg); and afterwards his combination of luminous landscape with figure-subjects (souvenir de fête, 1881; journée faite, 1888) gave him a wide repute, and made him the leader of a new school of idealistic subject-painting in france.

[Y] was the first son of abraham through the egyptian [X] (), the common patriarch of the abrahamic religions, and is venerated by muslims as a prophet.

jewish, christian and islamic traditions consider [Y] to be the ancestor of the [Y]ites ([X]enes or arabians) and patriarch of qaydār.

 according to muslim tradition, in which he is regarded as an ancestor of muhammad, [Y] thereby founded a great nation as promised by god in the old testament, and was buried with his mother [X] (hājar) next to the kaaba in mecca, under the area demarcated by the semi-circular hijr ismail wall.

  describes the naming of [Y], and god's promise to [X] concerning [Y] and his descendants.

 this occurred at the well of beer-lahai-roi, where [X] encountered the angel of the lord, who said to her "behold, you are with child / and shall bear a son; / you shall call him [Y], / for the lord has paid heed to your suffering.

rabbinical commentators in the midrash genesis rabbah also say that [Y]'s mother [X] was the pharaoh's daughter, making [Y] the pharaoh's grandson.

 according to genesis 21:21, [X] married [Y] to an egyptian woman, and if rabbinical commentators are correct that [X] was the pharaoh's daughter, his marriage to a woman she selected could explain how and why his sons became princes.

according to other jewish commentators, [Y]'s mother [X] is identified with keturah, the woman abraham sought out and married after sarah's death.

 like christians and jews, muslims believe that [Y] was the firstborn of abraham, born to him from his wife sarah's slave, [X].

 [X] soon bore [Y], who was the first son of abraham.

 god then instructed abraham to take [X] and [Y] to the desert and leave them there.

 to commemorate the blessing of the zamzam well god gave to [X] and [Y], muslims run between the safa and marwah hills retracing [X]'s steps during the rites of hajj.

the name [Y] is biblical in origin: in genesis 16:1-16; 17:18-25; 21:6-21; 25:9-17, [Y] was the son of abraham by the servant [X].

 at intervals came from his studio such pieces as the red cross knight, abraham offering up isaac, [X] and [Y] in the wilderness, the death of major peirson, the arrest of five members of the commons by charles the first, the siege of gibraltar, the surrender of admiral dewindt to lord camperdown, the offer of the crown to lady jane grey by the dukes of northumberland and suffolk, the resurrection, and others.

 abraham's firstborn son, through [X], [Y], became the progenitor of the [Y]ites, generally taken to be the arabs.

 she was so upset by the idea of [Y] inheriting their wealth, that she demanded that abraham send [X] and her son away.

early the next morning, abraham brought [X] and [Y] out together.

  he also told [X] that god  would "make a great nation" of [Y].

the quranic narrative slightly differs from the biblical account: it is allah alone who commands abraham to take [X] and [Y] down to the desert, later mecca, and leave them there.

 he helped her and said that god heard [Y] cry and would provide them with water, and [X] found the sacred zamzam well.

 later, mecca was known for its perfection and abundant water and an arab tribe called banu jurhum settled there with [X] and her son [Y], because of the presence of the water.

 they further argue that [X] and [Y] were not cast out as claimed by biblical narrative, but they were settled at makkah (paran) for the sake of almighty allah.

 william shakespeare refers to [X] in the merchant of venice act ii scene 5 line 40 when shylock says "what says that fool of [X]'s offspring, ha?" this line refers to the character launcelot, whom shylock is insulting by comparing him to the outcast [Y].

in islamic tradition, bakkah is where [X] and [Y] (ismā'īl) settled after being taken by abraham (ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story parallel to the bible's book of genesis (21:14-21)(but see below for the biblical geography).

 genesis tells that abraham gave [X] a bottle of water, and that [X] and [Y] ran out of water to drink in beer-sheba.

the islamic tradition holds that a spring gushed forth from the spot where [X] had laid [Y], and this spring came to be known as the well of zamzam.

in addition to the islamic tradition that [X] and [Y] settled in bakkah, the quran relates that abraham came to mecca to help his son [Y] build the kaaba adjacent to the well of zamzam.

 he also appears twice to [X], the slave-girl who has abraham's first child, [Y] ().

all three jamarāt represent the devil: the first and largest represents his temptation of abraham against sacrificing [Y] (ismāʿīl); the second represents the temptation of abraham's wife [X] (hājar) to induce her to stop him; the third represents his temptation of [Y] to avoid being sacrificed.

according to islamic tradition, abraham and [Y], his son by [X], built the kaʿbah as the house of god.

according to ibn ishaq, the buraq transported abraham when he visited [X] and [Y].

there is disagreement amongst jewish scholars as to whether keturah was, or was not, the same person as [X] (known in islam as hājar)—a handmaid of abraham's wife sarah, and abraham's concubine (or, in islamic tradition, his second wife)—who, together with her son [Y], was sent away by abraham at the insistence of sarah.

 for instance, in the dismissal of [X] and [Y] (1653, metropolitan museum of art, new york) maes portrays abraham banishing the handmaiden [X] along with their son, [Y].

  by showing [X]'s despondency and [Y]'s isolated posture the work is one of the most moving renderings of this theme, popular with rembrandt's pupils.

a greek source from the fifth century ce, "the ecclesiastical history of sozomen", speaks of how "abraham had bequeathed a monotheist religion" to arabs, that the arabs descended "from [Y] and [X]" and followed jewish practices such as not eating pork.

  the windows in the nave above the east arcade depict the following old testament figures: abraham, [X] and her child [Y], moses, pharaoh's daughter, joshua, and deborah.

in islamic tradition, the civilization of mecca started after ibrāhīm (abraham) left his son ismāʿīl ([Y]) and wife hājar ([X]) in the valley, which muslims believe was a command by god.

 while [X] was on either hillside, she was able to see [Y] and know he was safe.

the "[X] chorus", relating to the islamic story of [X] and the angel and the biblical story of [X] and [Y] is sung.

the casting out of [Y] and [X]

 [X] gave birth to abraham's firstborn son [Y], and after sarah gave birth to her own son isaac, she resented [X] and made abraham "cast her into the wilderness".

anglo-persian actress zoe sallis, who was cast as [X], was originally known as zoe ishmail, until huston decided that she change her name because of its similarity to the name of [Y], her character's son.

now these are the generations of [Y], abraham's son, whom [X] the egyptian, sarah's handmaid, bore unto abraham.

in the abrahamic religions, they are named after [Y], a prophet according to the quran, the first son of abraham and the egyptian [X].

[X] conceived [Y] from abraham, and the [Y]ites descend from him.

the [Y]ite story begins when abraham (ibrahim) and [X] (hajar) bear the prophetic child, who was named [Y] (ismail) in the order of god (allah) through one of his angels.

 god ordered abraham to take his son [Y] and wife [X] to present-day mecca.

[Y] and his mother, [X], suffered from great thirst.

 he helped them and said that god heard [Y] cry and would provide them with water, and [X] stopped the water with the help of stones.

after hājar ([X] of the bible), the wife of the ibrāhīm (abraham) and their son ismā’īl ([Y]) had settled in mecca, the tribe of jurhum,  happened to pass through there and agreed with hājar that they should remain there as a new spring of fresh water had emerged at that location.

 he writes that they are [Y]ites, descended from the son of [X], abraham's concubine, and that they name their children after sarah, so as not to be regarded as sons of [X], and therefore as slaves.

the parashah tells the stories of god's calling of abram (who would become abraham), abram's passing off his wife sarai as his sister, abram's dividing the land with his nephew lot, the war between the four kings and the five, the covenant between the pieces, sarai's tensions with her maid [X] and [X]'s son [Y], and the covenant of circumcision (brit milah).

 the angel told her to go back to her mistress and submit to her harsh treatment, for god would make [X]'s offspring too numerous to count; she would bear a son whom she should name [Y], for god had paid heed to her suffering.

 and when abram was 86 years old, [X] bore him a son, and abram gave him the name [Y].

 sarah saw [X]'s son [Y] playing, and sarah told abraham to cast [X] and [Y] out, saying that [Y] would not share in abraham's inheritance with isaac.

 early the next morning, abraham placed some bread and water on [X]'s shoulder, together with [Y], and sent them away.

 [X] and [Y] wandered in the wilderness of beersheba, and when the water ran out, she left the child under a bush, sat down about two bowshots away so as not to see the child die, and burst into tears.

 ibn munabbih further suggested an identification for tal faran as the 'mound of the two runaways', a place where the jurhum tribe found [X] and [Y] and thought of them as two runaways.

 he graduated in 1785 and was awarded a gold medal for his painting of [X] and [Y] in the desert.

 the arabs were as deeply interested in the matter as the christians, for they were descended from abraham, and the genealogy of the descendants of [X] and [Y] was of the greatest importance in their sight, and it is due to their earnest desire to possess correct genealogical tables of their ancestors that we owe the arabic translations of the cave of treasures.

[X]  is a biblical person in the book of genesis, handmaid of sarah (the first wife of abraham) and mother of abraham's son [Y].

in islamic tradition, ibrahim left his wife, [X] ([X]) and their son, isma'il, in the valley of mecca when [Y] was an infant.

 secondly, it refers to [Y]ites: descendants of abraham through his handmaid [X] and their child [Y], in the same way as the jews claimed descent and their ancestral faith from abraham through his wife sarah and their child isaac.

 one such biblical painting is [X] and [Y], which highmore donated to the foundling hospital for the purpose of decorating its court room.

the wilderness of paran, mentioned in , was the limit of the territory attacked by chedorlaomer and his alliance during the time of abraham, and it was the place where abraham's second wife [X] and their first-born son [Y] were sent into exile from abraham's dwelling in beersheba.

the hagrites (also spelled [X]ite or hagerite, and called [X]enes, agarenes, and sons of agar) were associated with the [Y]ites mentioned in the bible, the inhabitants of the regions of jetur, naphish and nodab lying east of gilead.

 god spoke to the slave [X] in the desert, sent her home, and she bore abraham a son, [Y], "a wild donkey of a man" (genesis 16:12).

 [X] and [Y] are sent away again, and this time they do not return (genesis 21:1-5).

 pilgrims spend a day and a night on the plains of mina, then a day praying and worshipping in the plain of mount arafat, then spending a night on the plain of muzdalifah; then moving to jamarat, symbolically stoning the devil, then going to the city of mecca and walking seven times around the kaaba, which muslims believe abraham built as a place of worship, then walking seven times between mount safa and mount marwah recounting the steps of abraham's wife, [X], while she was looking for water for her baby [Y] in the desert before mecca developed into a settlement.

nicolaes maes - abraham dismissing [X] and [Y]

 it was first mentioned in the book of genesis (), by [X], mother of abraham's eldest son, [Y].

other issues many muslims have found offensive include abraham being called a "bastard" for casting [X] and [Y] in the desert; and a character named salman the persian who serves as one of the prophet's scribes, an apparent reference to the story, controversial among muslims, of a meccan convert by the name of ibn abi sarh, who left islam after the prophet failed to notice small changes he had made in the dictation of the qur'an.

hājar (), known as [X] in the hebrew bible, was the wife of the patriarch and islamic prophet ibrāhīm (abraham) and the mother of ismā'īl ([Y]).

 in the biblical account, [Y] is one of the two children of [X] and jacob, a brother to benjamin, and father to both ephraim, and his first son, manasseh; although manasseh was the eldest, jacob foresaw that ephraim's descendants would be greater than his brother's.

 some critics, however, view this as a postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe to others in the israelite confederation in the biblical account, [Y] is one of the two children of [X] and jacob, a brother to benjamin, and father to both ephraim, and his first son, manasseh; ephraim received the blessing of the firstborn, although manasseh was the eldest, because jacob foresaw that ephraim's descendants would be greater than his brother's.

 [Y] von führich – jacob encountering [X] with her father's herd

according to the old testament, the tribe consisted of descendants of [Y], a son of jacob and [X], from whom it took its name; however, some biblical scholars view this also as postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe to others in the israelite confederation.

 in mishkan t'filah, the american reform jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to god as “he” have been removed, and whenever jewish patriarchs are named (abraham, [X], and [Y]), so also are the matriarchs (sarah, rebecca, rachel, and leah.

 the narrative is punctuated by a series of covenants with god, successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the covenant with noah) to a special relationship with one people alone (abraham and his descendants through [X] and [Y]).

 (the stories of [X] do not make up a coherent cycle of stories and function as a bridge between the cycles of abraham and [Y].

 [X] favored esau, and rebekah favored [Y].

 while esau was hunting, [Y], after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that [Y] became [X]'s primary heir and esau was left in an inferior position.

 thereafter, [X] sent [Y] into mesopotamia to take a wife of his mother's brother's house.

according to local tradition, the graves of [X] and rebekah, along with the graves of abraham and sarah and [Y] and leah, are in the cave of the patriarchs.

in the epistle to the hebrews, abraham's willingness to follow god's command to sacrifice [X] is used as an example of faith as is [X]'s action in blessing [Y] and esau with reference to the future promised by god to abraham.

 among [X]'s children was the follow-up israelite patriarch [Y], who is also venerated as an islamic prophet.

[X] is mentioned seventeen times by name in the quran, often with his father and his son, [Y].

 in a fuller description, when angels came to abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on sodom and gomorrah, his wife, sarah, "laughed, and we gave her good tidings of [X], and after [X] of (a grandson) [Y]" (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite abraham and sarah's old age.

 several verses speak of [X] as a "gift" to abraham (6: 84; 14: 49–50), and 24: 26–27 adds that god made "prophethood and the book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson [Y], and his prophetic great-grandson joseph.

elsewhere in the quran, [X] is mentioned in lists: joseph follows the religion of his forefathers abraham, [X] and [Y] (12: 38) and speaks of god's favor to them (12: 6); [Y]'s sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the god that their forefathers, "abraham, ishmael and [X]", worshiped (2: 127); and the quran commands muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "abraham, ishmael, [X], [Y] and the patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84).

 [X] and [Y] are mentioned as being bestowed upon abraham as gifts of god, who then worshipped god only and were righteous leaders in the way of god:

according to martin noth, a scholar of the hebrew bible, the narratives of [X] date back to an older cultural stage than that of the west-jordanian [Y].

 later, the descendants of [X]'s son [Y] were enslaved in egypt, and god commanded moses to lead the exodus from egypt.

 [Y] first appears in the book of genesis, where he is described as the son of [X] and rebecca, and the grandson of abraham, sarah and bethuel.

 according to the biblical account, he was the second-born of [X]'s children, the elder being [Y]'s fraternal twin brother, esau.

[Y] and his twin brother, esau, were born to [X] and rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when [X] was 60 years of age.

 moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: "and [X] loved esau, because he did eat of his venison: but rebecca loved [Y].

 it is suggested that she realized prophetically that [X]'s blessings would go to [Y], since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger.

 rebecca blessed [Y] and she quickly ordered [Y] to bring her two kid goats from their flock so that he could take esau's place in serving [X] and receiving his blessing.

 [Y] did as his mother instructed and, when he returned with the kids, rebecca made the savory meat that [X] loved.

disguised as esau, [Y] entered [X]'s room.

 [X] demanded that [Y] come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like esau's hairy skin.

 confused, [X] exclaimed, "the voice is [Y]'s voice, but the hands are the hands of esau!" still trying to get at the truth, [X] asked him directly, "art thou my very son esau?" and [Y] answered simply, "i am.

" [X] proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that [Y] gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him.

 as [Y] kissed his father, [X] smelled the clothes which belonged to esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was esau.

 [X] then blessed [Y] with the blessing that was meant for esau.

 the realization that he had been deceived shocked [X], yet he acknowledged that [Y] had received the blessings by adding, "indeed, he will be [or remain] blessed!" (27:33).

 having made [Y] a ruler over his brothers, [X] could only promise, "by your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck" (27:39–40).

although esau sold [Y] his own birthright, which was his blessing, for "red pottage," esau still hated [Y] for receiving his blessing that their father [X] unknowingly had given to him.

 he vowed to kill [Y] as soon as [X] died.

 she convinced [X] to send [Y] away by telling him that she despaired of his marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of canaan (as esau had done).

 after [X] sent [Y] away to find a wife, esau realized his own canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes and so he took a daughter of [X]'s half-brother, ishmael, as another wife.

 [Y] actually diverted himself to succoth and was not recorded as rejoining esau until, at machpelah, the two bury their father [X], who lived to be 180, and was 60 years older than they were.

 [Y] was finally reunited with his father [X] in mamre (outside hebron).

when [X] died at the age of 180, [Y] and esau buried him in the cave of the patriarchs, which abraham had purchased as a family burial plot.

 a conservative interpretation is that, at [X]'s burial, [Y] obtained the records of esau, who had been married 80 years prior, and incorporated them into his own family records, and that moses augmented and published them.

 in that case, since [X] was 60 when [Y] and essau were born and they had been married for 20 years, then [X] was 40 years old when he married rebecca (gen.

 in either case, [X] and rebecca were married for 20 years before [Y] and esau were born.

rashi explained that [X], when blessing [Y] instead of esau, smelled the heavenly scent of gan eden (paradise) when [Y] entered his room and, in contrast, perceived gehenna opening beneath esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by esau's show of piety.

in contrast to the judeo-christian view of [Y], one main difference is that the story of [Y]'s blessing, in which he deceives [X], is not accepted in islam.

 dever wrote in 2001: "after a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham, [X], or [Y] 'historical figures.

 according to rabbi jose bar hanina, each of the patriarchs instituted one prayer: abraham the morning, [X] the afternoon and [Y] the evening prayers.

[Y] was the eldest son of joseph abendana and brother to [X] abendana.

several years later, with his brother, [X], [Y] published the bible commentary miklal yofi by solomon ben melekh which included his own commentary, lekket shikchah (gleanings), on the pentateuch, the book of joshua, and part of the book of judges.

the biblical book of genesis speaks of the relationship between fraternal twins [Y] and esau, sons of [X] and rebecca.

 the story focuses on esau's loss of his birthright to [Y] and the conflict that ensued between their descendant nations because of [Y]'s deception of their aged and blind father, [X], in order to receive esau's birthright/blessing from [X].

this conflict was paralleled by the affection the parents had for their favored child: "[X], who had a taste for wild game, loved esau, but rebekah loved [Y].

 despite the deception on the part of [Y] and his mother to gain [X]'s patriarchal blessing, [Y]'s vocation as [X]'s legitimate heir in the continued founding of the jewish people is reaffirmed.

 [Y] brought [X] a dish of goat meat prepared by rebecca to taste like venison.

 she explains to [X] that she has sent [Y] to find a wife among her own people.

 [Y], having fled for his life, leaves behind the wealth of [X]'s flocks and land and tents in esau's hands.

 the next time [Y] and esau meet is at the burial of their father, [X], in hebron.

 [X] then refuses to take [Y]'s blessing back after learning he was tricked, and does not give this blessing to esau but, after esau begs, gives him an inferior blessing.

 for example, in the 11th-century writings of [X] ben [Y] ha-cohen, lilith left adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the garden of eden after she had coupled with the archangel samael.

the mystical writing of two brothers [Y] and [X] hacohen, treatise on the left emanation, which predates the zohar by a few decades, states that samael and lilith are in the shape of an androgynous being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the throne of glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to adam and eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite.

", while  commands the believers of islam to "say: we believe in god and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto abraham and ishmael and [X] and [Y] and the tribes, and that which moses and jesus received, and which the prophets received from their lord.

 rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

” more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

rendsburg argued that the empire of [X] and [Y] provided the setting for the statement in  that god gave to abraham and his descendants “this land, from the river of egypt to the great river, the euphrates.

” rendsburg reasoned that this passage makes sense only in the period of [X] and [Y], as before [X] and [Y], it would have been unimaginable for an author to use these boundaries to define the land of israel, and after [X] and [Y], israel once more became a small state and those boundaries were an impossibility.

 rendsburg cited this as further support for his conclusion that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 rendsburg argued that the only time that an author would considered this necessary would be in the time of [X] and [Y], as before then, there were no kings (except for the transitional saul), and after then, kingship was a fait accompli.

 arguing that the only time that an author would need to justify kingship was when it was the new creation of israelite political theorists, rendsburg cited these verses as further evidence that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis.

 the sifre cited as examples of admonition near death: (1) when abraham reproved abimelech in , (2) when isaac reproved abimelech, ahuzzath, and phicol in , (3) when joshua admonished the israelites in , (4) when samuel admonished the israelites in , and (5) when [X] admonished [Y] in .

 rendsburg explained genesis's interest with this motif by recalling that [X] was the youngest of jesse’s seven sons (see ), and [Y] was among the youngest, if not the youngest, of [X]’s sons (see ).

 the two remaining candidates were adonijah ([X]’s fourth son) and [Y], and although adonijah was older (and once claimed the throne when [X] was old and feeble in ), [Y] won out.

 an israelite could thus not criticize [X]’s selection of [Y] to succeed him as king over israel, because genesis reported that god had favored younger sons since abel and blessed younger sons of israel — isaac, jacob, judah, joseph, perez, and ephraim — since the inception of the covenant.

 more generally, rendsburg concluded that royal scribes living in jerusalem during the reigns of [X] and [Y] in the tenth century bce were responsible for genesis; their ultimate goal was to justify the monarchy in general, and the kingship of [X] and [Y] in particular; and genesis thus appears as a piece of political propaganda.

rendsburg read in  — which portrays the nations of moab and ammon, transjordanian states ruled by [X] and [Y], as descendants of the sons of lot (and thus the grandnephews of abraham) — to indicate that the author of genesis sought to portray the ancestors of these countries as related to the patriarchs in order to justify israelite rule over them.

 rendsburg noted further that  refers to “the land of moriah,” and this word occurs in the bible in only one other place,  “[Y] began to build the temple of yhvh in jerusalem on mount moriah, which appeared to [X] his father, and which [X] had prepared as the place, at the threshing floor of ornan (a variant of araunah) the jebusite.

 born: estelle reiner, american actress and singer, wife to [X] and mother of [Y], famous for delivering the punchline "i'll have what she's having" in when harry met sally.

 it features the final screen performance of [X], the father of the original film's director [Y].

1994 – [Y] begins to assume supreme leadership of north korea upon the death of his father, [X].

 possibly to avoid referring to [X], [Y] or kim jong-un as the enemy, the second syllable of "enemy" is written and pronounced  in the north.

the ruling kim family in north korea ([X], [Y] and kim jong-un) has been described as a de facto absolute monarchy or a "hereditary dictatorship".

in 1992, as [X]'s health began deteriorating, [Y] slowly began taking over various state tasks.

 [X] died of a heart attack in 1994, with [Y] declaring a three-year period of national mourning before officially announcing his position as the new leader afterwards.

 his grandfather [X], the founder and leader of north korea until his death in 1994, is the country's "eternal president", while his father [Y] who succeeded [X] as the leader was announced "eternal general secretary" and "eternal chairman of the national defence commission" after his death in 2011.

 the control the north korean government exercises over many aspects of the nation's culture is used to perpetuate the cult of personality surrounding [X], and [Y].

 while visiting north korea in 1979, journalist bradley martin wrote that nearly all music, art, and sculpture that he observed glorified "great leader" [X], whose personality cult was then being extended to his son, "dear leader" [Y].

 following the death of [X], north koreans were prostrating and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event; similar scenes were broadcast by state television following the death of [Y].

 one point of view is that [Y]'s cult of personality was solely out of respect for [X] or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage, while north korean government sources consider it genuine hero worship.

 portraits and sculptures depicting [X], [Y] and kim jong-un are classed as "number one works".

 the event is an artistic representation of the country's history and pays homage to [X] and [Y].

 [X]'s son, [Y], succeeded him, and was in turn succeeded by his son, kim jong-un.

in october 1980, [Y] was introduced to the public at the sixth party congress as the successor to [X].

 the politics in the last years of [X] closely resemble those of the beginning of the [Y] era.

after the death of [X] in 1994, his son, [Y] reigned as the new leader, which marked the closure of one chapter of north korean politics.

 in april 1997, on the 85th anniversary of [X]'s birthday, [Y] promoted 127 general and admiral grade officers.

after [X]'s death in 1994, some members of [Y]'s faction proposed changing the name of pyongyang to "[X] city" (), but others suggested that north korea should begin calling seoul "[X] city" instead and grant pyongyang the moniker "[Y] city".

 [X] became the supreme leader until his death in 1994, after which his son, [Y] took power.

 it is comparable in many ways to that of mao zedong in china and of [X] and [Y] in north korea.

 according to lim jae-cheon, kim cannot have been born in vyatskoye as [X]'s war records show that he arrived at vyatskoye only in july 1942 and had been living in voroshilov before, thus [Y] is generally agreed to have been born in voroshilov.

 another flower, kimilsungia, is an orchid cultivar named after [Y]'s father and predecessor, [X].

 [X] organized his resistance against the japanese forces there, and north korea claims that [Y] was born there, although records outside of north korea suggest that he was actually born in the soviet union.

 other communist leaders with pronounced cults of personality such as mao zedong, [X], ho chi minh, [Y] and most recently hugo chávez have also had their cadavers preserved in the fashion of lenin's preservation and are now displayed in their respective mausoleums.

in north korea, manse was used to wish long life for [Y], and for the political principles of his father, [X].

after [Y]'s death in 2011, he received a similar treatment to his father [X], being declared "eternal general secretary of the workers' party of korea" and "eternal chairman of the national defense commission".

 currently, embalmed communist leaders can also be found in the mausoleum of mao zedong, the ho chi minh mausoleum, and the kumsusan palace of the sun for [X] and [Y].

[X] developed the ideology, which was originally viewed as a variant of marxism–leninism until it was declared a distinct ideology by his son and successor, [Y].

 north korean state media had previously described [X]'s ideas as "contemporary marxism–leninism"; by calling them "kimilsungism", [Y] sought to elevate the ideas of his father to the same level of prestige as stalinism and maoism.

 as well as stating that the wpk was "the party of [X] and [Y]", the conference proclaimed kimilsungism–kimjongilism as "the only guiding idea of the party".

 in the 4th conference's aftermath, the korean central news agency (kcna) stated that "the korean people have long called the revolutionary policies ideas of the president [[X]] and [Y] as kimilsungism–kimjongilism and recognized it as the guiding of the nation".

 thanks to [X], [Y] argued, the revolution had "put forward original lines and policies suited to our people's aspirations and the specific situation of our country".

 mass games are the culminating annual celebrations of the state leader's birthdays and the rituals commemorating the foundation of the state: on the birthdays of [X] (april 15, 1912), the founding father of north korea, and [Y] (born february 16, 1942), the former leader of the state.

 [X] and [Y] badges

in the early 1980s, [Y] sought to reduce the song's importance to the benefit of "song of general [X]".

"song of general [X]" and "song of general [Y]" have since taken the place of de facto national anthems domestically, and "aegukka" is reserved for representing north korea internationally: when foreign dignitaries visit the country or north korean athletes compete at international sporting competitions.

 instead of depicting the portrait of north korea's founder [X], the note depicts an image of his birthplace in mangyondae and on the back the international friendship exhibition in myohyangsan that displays gifts he and his son [Y] received from foreign leaders.

 there has been ongoing speculation that this could indicate plans for higher denominations to be released later which would depict [X], [Y], or possibly both.

 many older musical forms remain and are used in both traditional performances that have been attuned to the ideas and the way of life of the modern north korean communist state and to accompany modern songs in praise of [X], his son and successor, [Y], and kim jong-un from 2012 onward, plus songs that wish for a reunited korea, thus creating a mix of traditional and western music that is truly north korean, a unique variant of korean music as a whole mixing the old and the new.

 she also said that the order for the bombing had been "personally penned" by [Y], the son of north korean supreme leader [X], who had wanted to destabilize the south korean government, disrupt its upcoming 1988 parliamentary elections, and frighten international teams from attending the 1988 summer olympics in seoul later that year.

 because [Y] aimed to keep his affair with song a secret due to the disapproval of his father [X], he initially kept jong-nam out of school, instead sending him to live with song's older sister song hye-rang, who tutored him at home.

 these reports were supported in april 2009 when kim jong-un assumed a low-level position within the ruling workers' party since [Y] was groomed by his own father, [X], in a similar way before becoming north korean leader in 1994.

 a similar campaign was launched in praise of [Y]'s mother (kim jong-suk) during the later years of [X]'s life.

 they were abducted on the orders of [Y], the son of north korean president [X], who wanted to use them to improve the north korean film industry.

emphasizing the names of [X], [Y], and kim jong-un by enlarging their names on the text.

 in contrast, kim jong-un, [Y] and [X] are credited for their "outstanding wisdom", "unique abilities" or "noble virtue".

the 2012 joint editorial edition, the first under kim jong-un's leadership, started with a great tribute to [Y] and aside from recurring calls for improving inter-korean relations and for the fulfillment of the october 4 declaration of 2007, also called on the whole nation to give priority to do [Y]'s 2012 mission of strong and prosperous nation, continue his and his father [X]'s legacies to the entire country and the socialist cause, and to build up and encourage the various sectors that compose the nation to become contributors to national progress in all areas at all costs.

 this held true when [X] died in 1994 and was succeeded by [Y], who in turn was succeeded by kim jong-un in 2011.

the north korean government promotes the cult of personality of [Y] and [X], described as a political religion, as well as the juche ideology, based on korean ultranationalism, which calls on people to "avoid spiritual deference to outside influences", which was interpreted as including religion originating outside of korea.

 at this time the rank of marshal was divided into two ranks: the rank of marshal with the title "marshal of the democratic people's republic of korea" (konghwaguk wonsu) was conferred upon [X]'s son [Y], and the same rank but with the title "marshal of the korean people's army" was conferred upon o jin-u.

one armoured train that remains in regular use is that of [X] and [Y], which the former received as a gift from the soviet union and the latter used heavily for state visits to china and russia as he had a fear of flying.

prior to an internal propaganda film released after the ascension of kim jong-un, there were three attempts made to idolize ko, in a style similar to that associated with kang pan-sok, mother of [X], and kim jong-suk, mother of [Y] and the first wife of [X].

kim pyong-il (, ; born 10 august 1954) is the younger paternal half-brother of the former leader of north korea, [Y], and the only surviving son of former leader and president of north korea [X].

 [Y] knew that this could be portrayed as a threat to the cult of personality surrounding their father [X], and reported the matter; [X] was reportedly infuriated, and thus kim pyong-il fell out of favour with his father while [Y] strengthened his position.

 there is a bar and a bookshop which stocks north korean reading material including treatises of president [X] and general [Y].

kimilsungism-kimjongilism, after [X] and [Y]

 the attack coincided with a meeting of the conference of non-aligned nations in colombo, sri lanka, at which [Y], the son of north korean leader [X], presented the incident as an example of american aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a u.

 15 were carried out under the rule of [X] and 16 under [Y].

 it is thought that kim's official birth year was changed for symbolic reasons; 1982 marks 70 years after the birth of his grandfather, [X], and 40 years after the official birth of his father [Y].

 there have also been reports that citizens in north korea were encouraged to sing a newly composed "song of praise" to kim jong-un, in a similar fashion to that of praise songs relating to [Y] and [X].

 the only higher rank is dae wonsu (roughly translated as grand marshal or generalissimo) which was held by kim's grandfather, [X], and which was awarded posthumously to his father, [Y], in february 2012.

 during the presidency of [X], [Y] helped to run his father's own personality cult.

 although the "song of general [Y]" is not as widely popular as the "song of general [X]" (nor was his cult as large as his father's), it is also played regularly in north korea.

in the north, names of leaders  ([X]),  ([Y]) and  (kim jong-un) are always set off from surrounding text, typically by bolding the characters, increasing the font size, or both.

within four hours of the attack, [Y], the son of the north korean leader, [X], addressed the conference of non-aligned nations in colombo, sri lanka, and presented a prepared document describing the incident as an unprovoked attack on north korean guards that had been led by american officers.

according to jang jin-sung, kim song-ae had the ambition to place her son, kim pyong-il in the position of successor to her spouse [X], rather than his son from his first marriage, [Y].

 in this, she was supposedly supported by a faction of the north korean political elite, among them her brother kim kwang-hop, and [X]'s brother kim yong-ju, and opposed by the faction of her stepson [Y].

 in parallel, her stepson [Y] became the designated heir of [X], and his faction worked to remove her from influence.

 south korea accused [Y], son of then-north korean leader [X], of ordering the 1987 bombing of flight 858.

in 2016, the title "eternal leaders of juche korea" was introduced by amending the preamble of the constitution, which was given to [X] and [Y].

 in the 1970s, [Y], before he became leader, made sure the mansudae art troupe portrayed his father [X] as a revolutionary genius who liberated korea from the japanese occupation, portrayed the history of the kim family favourably and eulogising north korean revolutionaries.

 these include the man'gyŏndae prize held since at least 2002 in march through april in honour of [X]'s birthday, the paektusan prize held since at least 2010 in february in honour of [Y]'s birthday, and the poch'ŏnbo torch prize held since 2010 in may through june to mark the anniversary of the battle of poch'ŏnbo.

 [X] and [Y] badges

the youth movement shifted its focus after [X]'s death and expanded its ideological indoctrination to include the "revolutionary accomplishments" of [Y] and the "brilliance" of songun.

 after his years as a guerilla leader, [X] had moved to the soviet union (where historians believe his son [Y] was born in 1941) and had become a captain in the red army.

this kim yong-il should not be confused with another kim yong-il (1955–2000?), the son of the late [X] and half-brother of [Y], who is said to have died in germany in 2000.

 this allowed [Y], who was [X]'s designated successor, to be elected as chairman of the national defence commission on 9 april 1993.

 the media dedicate a large portion of their resources toward political propaganda and promoting the personality cult of [X], [Y], and kim jong-un.

[Y] was made commander-in-chief and head of the military affairs commission by his father [X] in the spring of 1994.

 he was married to kim kyong-hui, the only daughter of north korean premier [X] and his first wife kim jong-suk, and only sister of north korean general secretary [Y].

 at the time, kim pyong-il, the son of [X] and half-brother of future north korean leader [Y], had just arrived in budapest as ambassador; in response to hungary's moves towards ties with the south, the north transferred him to bulgaria.

 seong's younger sister song hye-rim, a popular actress, secretly began an affair with [Y] against his father [X]'s wishes in the late 1960s or early 1970s, which culminated in hye-rim's forced divorce from her husband; hye-rang first learned of the situation on 10 may 1971, when kim came to her residence in the middle of the night and informed her that he had impregnated her younger sister.

yi's mother, seong hye-rang, raised [Y]'s and her younger sister hye-rim's son kim jong-nam alongside yi and yi's sister nam-ok at a secluded villa outside of pyongyang in order to keep jong-nam's parentage a secret from [X].

 during [Y]'s rule, only [X] hung on these buildings, although his portrait on the building below the flag of the dprk was removed.

the ability of chukjibeop (축지법 縮地法) was attributed to north korean leaders [X] and [Y] in the propaganda song "the general uses warp".

he was elected chairman of the standing committee of the supreme people's assembly in 1983, after having been a vice-chairman since 1962; in this capacity, he assumed the functions of de facto head of state after [X]'s death in 1994, as the post of president of the republic was never reassigned; however, actual power was held by [Y].

 however, at the same time [X] started grooming his own son [Y] to be his designated successor, and a power struggle erupted.

it was the period when the wpk was focusing ideologically on [X]'s juche; while [Y] actively stood for this process, kim yong-ju, having studied in russia, supported a more classical view of marxism and was not fond of the extensive personality cult built around his brother.

 this played to [Y]'s advantage: kim yong-ju was more and more marginalized, his key allies kim to-man (director of propaganda) and  (director of international liaison) were removed, and he himself was finally attacked by [X].

 [Y]'s son and successor kim jong-un declared 2012, the centennial of the birth of [X], as the year of strong and prosperous nation.

 furthermore, when referring to the "three great generals of paekdu mountain," a sacred dormant volcano on north korea's northern border with china, north koreans understand this to mean [X], kim jong-suk, and their son [Y].

likewise, in celebration of his father's 60th birthday, [Y] produced three operas for him, built three monuments, including north korea's arch of triumph, for his 70th birthday in 1982, and upon [X]'s death in 1994, [Y] declared three years of mourning before fully claiming leadership of north korea.

 politburo members under [X] and [Y] lacked a strong power base, and depended on the party leader for their position.

 with the death of o jin-u in 1995, [Y] remained the only member of the politburo standing committee still alive; the four others ([X], kim il, o jin-u, and ri jong-ok) died in office.

at this congress, [X] designated his son [Y] as his successor.

 there was no official reason for its postponement, but it was probably due to the fact that wpk general secretary [X] spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor [Y].

 the primary reason for the 6th congress was to formalize [Y] as [X]'s chosen successor.

significant at the 6th congress was the generational shift within the wpk, with [X] planning to formalize the position of [Y].

 the elected 6th central military commission (cmc) was composed of 19 members, of which [Y] ranked third (behind [X] and o jin-u).

 [X] and [Y] became the only officials with seats in all four bodies: the presidium, politburo, secretariat and cmc.

 in the 1990s, a third kind of portrait was added that depicts [Y] and [X] engaged in discussion about state management.

 high-ranking officials were given yet another portrait, that of [X]'s first wife and mother of [Y], kim jong-suk.

dual seedline christian identity proponents— those who believe that eve bore children with satan as well as with [X] —believe that eve was seduced by the serpent (satan), shared her fallen state with [X] by having sex with him, and gave birth to twins with different fathers: satan's son [Y] and [X]'s son abel.

 the account states that [Y], the son of [X] from the bible, had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men.

 the musical is based on the book of genesis, with act i telling the story of [X] and eve, [Y], and abel, while act ii deals with noah and the flood.

 the production was directed by john caird, and starred ken page as father, richard lloyd-king as the snake, martin smith as [X], shezwae powell as eve, adrian beaumont as [Y], kevin colson as noah, earlene bentley as mama noah, frances ruffelle as yonah, anthony barclay as japheth, craig pinder as shem, ray shell as ham, hiromi itoh as aysha and ruthie henshall as aphra.

the cast featured william solo as father, adrian zmed as [X]/noah, stephanie mills as eve/mama noah, darius de haas as [Y]/japheth, hunter foster as abel/ham, and kelli rabke as yonah.

  the concert featured ron bohmer as father, ashley brown as eve/mama noah, charl brown as [X]/noah, rebecca naomi jones as yonah, and jeremy jordan as [Y]/japheth.

 [X] and eve are driven out of the garden by father into the wasteland surrounding the garden and have two children, [Y] and abel ("the expulsion" and "the wasteland").

several years later, [X], eve, [Y], and abel continue their lives, hoping and praying that father will one day bring them home to eden.

 [Y] complains to abel that their parents won't let them see the world beyond the glen and that [X] and eve seemingly let themselves get kicked out of eden ("lost in the wilderness").

[X] and eve, deeply worried about [Y]'s safety out in the wasteland, find some comfort in the fact that they have been able to create a life and family for themselves outside of eden ("close to home"), but this peacefulness is once again shattered when [Y], back from his journey, tells the family that he has found a ring of giant stones, seemingly providing evidence of other humans.

 [X]'s betrayal quickly leads to a family-wide fight, culminating in [Y] threatening to leave forever and taking abel with him.

 [Y], beginning to leave, is forcibly stopped by [X], who slaps [Y], which sends him to the ground.

 [Y] tells [X] that he will kill him and the two attempt to fight, but when abel intervenes, he is thrown off [Y], who, in his rage, beats him to death with a stone ("the death of abel").

 [Y] leaves the remaining members of his family, telling [X] that it should have been him that should be dead.

 she attempts to speak to father about [Y]'s departure from the family, [X]'s grief over the loss of both his sons, the birth of another son, seth, who has since had children of his own, and [X]'s recent death.

  it escalates into a fight, directly mirroring the one between [X] and [Y] generations ago, and it is only because yonah intervenes that one of the brothers is not killed.

 the existence of pre-[X]ites, la peyrère argued, explained [Y]'s taking of a wife and the building of a city after abel's murder in the book of genesis.

 some pre-[X]ite theorists held the view that [Y] left his family for an inferior tribe described variously as "nonwhite mongols" or that [Y] took a wife from one of the inferior pre-[X]ic peoples.

 it followed that if the tribes of judah were supposed to have intermarried with [Y]’s descendants, the jews were both the offspring of satan and the descendants of sundry nonwhite pre-[X]ic races.

 identity preacher conrad gaard wrote that the serpent was a "beast of the field", was the father of [Y], and since [Y] married a pre-[X]ite, his descendants were a "mongrel, hybrid race".

 the belief's adherents commonly use it to justify antisemitism and racism by claiming that jews or members of non-white races are the descendants of [Y] and the serpent, who they variably interpret to be satan or an intelligent non-human creature which lived before [X] and eve.

 the doctrine frames human history as a conflict between these two races in which the descendants of [X] will eventually triumph over the descendants of [Y] and the serpent.

 because the biblical record explicitly names [X] as the father of [Y], the teaching of the serpent seed is considered incompatible with the protestant teaching of biblical infallibility.

 moon believed that both [Y] and abel were physically descended from [X] and eve, but taught that "[Y] is in the position of satan's son".

 [X] and eve had two sons, [Y] and abel (qayin and heḇel), the first a tiller of the ground, the second a keeper of sheep.

in the second-season episode "pegasus", admiral helena [Y] cites [X]a's closure of the tribunal in denying his request for a jury court-martial for helo and tyrol.

" [Y] relates to [X]a and president laura roslin how she ordered a risky maneuver to escape the initial cylon attack on the twelve colonies.

 [X]a recognizes [Y] as his superior officer, but [Y] promises not to interfere with galacticas internal affairs.

[Y] declines to resupply the fleet's civilian ships and integrates the battlestars' crews, transferring apollo and starbuck to pegasus over commander [X]a's objections.

 [X]a reiterates his willingness to follow [Y], to both roslin and tigh, and insists that apollo and starbuck obey their transfer orders.

 [Y] denies [X]a's request that helo and tyrol be given a jury court-martial and sentences them both to death for murder and treason.

 [X]a demands that [Y] return them to galactica and orders vipers to escort a marine assault team to pegasus.

a conversation between [Y] and [X]a makes clear that pegasus is much larger, more advanced, and more powerful than galactica.

davis compares [X]a's defiance of [Y] to apollo's mutiny in "kobol's last gleaming".

 eick says the amount [X]a looks at [Y] in "pegasus" indicates that he respects her.

 moore abandoned several elements of the original-series episode involving [Y], "the living legend"; the main similarities in his view are [Y] appearing suddenly in the pegasus and being "more of a hardass character than commander [X]a.

" moore considers the key differences to be [Y]'s gender and her authority over [X]a.

in the episode, admiral helena [Y] and commander william [X]a call a truce but plan to assassinate each other.

 [Y] and [X]a both cancel their plots, but gina escapes from the pegasus brig and kills [Y].

 [X]a ordered galactica's vipers launched toward pegasus, and [Y] ordered the pegasus vipers to intercept them.

both viper groups seek permission to fire, but neither [Y] nor [X]a grants it.

 [Y] and [X]a call off their attacks and agree to meet on colonial one as neutral ground.

 later, roslin warns [X]a privately that [Y] will strike against [X]a again and urges him to assassinate [Y] first.

 realizing that roslin is right about [Y], [X]a orders starbuck to assassinate [Y] once the attack on the cylon fleet concludes.

 likewise, [Y] directs fisk to take a detachment of marines to galactica to kill [X]a after the attack.

 [Y] and [X]a contact fisk and starbuck respectively, but neither gives the order to assassinate.

[Y]'s decision not to kill [X]a demonstrates that she is "human and.

 however, the contrast between [Y]'s decision to pillage her civilian fleet and [X]a's decision to protect his reflects "an issue of character rather than humanizing circumstance" (emphasis clifton's).

starbuck is conflicted over her loyalty to [X]a and apollo and her hope that [Y] will help her rescue anders.

amanda keith of the los angeles newspaper group disputes starbuck's assertion in the eulogy that the fleet was safer with [Y] in command; keith attributes starbuck's assessment to dissatisfaction with [X]a and roslin's leadership and ignorance of [Y]'s past misdeeds.

 keith also believes roslin is mistaken in her assessment of [Y] as irredeemable; after all, [Y] did back down from killing [X]a.

instead of giving starbuck the order to kill [Y], [X]a muses, "it's not enough to survive.

" clifton compares the conflict between [Y]'s urge to fight the cylons and roslin and [X]a's commitment to maintaining civil society to the struggle between [X]a and roslin in the miniseries over whether to fight the cylons or flee.

 he cites [X]a and [Y]'s assassination plots and their regrets over them, [X]a inspecting his surgical scar, starbuck and fisks's mutual wishes of "good hunting", and apollo and gina's death wishes.

 clifton argues further that roslin pushes for [X]a to assassinate [Y] because she expects her cancer to kill her soon and considers baltar, who as vice president would succeed her, unfit to stand up to [Y].

 originally the conflict between [Y] and [X]a was to center around [Y]'s failure to protect civilian decoys during the battle with the cylons despite a promise to roslin.

 at one point during writing, the script explained why roslin does not promote [X]a over [Y] to defuse the situation: roslin knows [Y] does not accept her authority as president and would not obey [X]a's orders.

[Y]'s code word "case orange" for fisk to kill [X]a refers to war plan orange, a contingency plan developed by the american military before the second world war in case of a japanese attack.

 [Y]'s specific directive to "terminate [X]a's command, starting with [X]a" is an homage to a line delivered by harrison ford's character in apocalypse now referring to kurtz.

 [X]a's code word "downfall" for starbuck to kill [Y] refers to the german film of that name or possibly operation downfall, the planned allied invasion of japan at the end of the second world war.

 jacob clifton gave part 1 an a, praising the moral ambiguity around [Y]'s actions, olmos's performance, the editing of the final scene in which [Y] and [X]a give their assassination orders, and starbuck, [X]a, and fisk's reluctance to participate in the assassination plots.

 he gave part 2 an a+, calling actress michelle forbes ([Y])'s performance "wonderful", the battle scenes "awesome", the battle music "[g]rand, wonderful, sad and angry and terrible", and the final scene between [X]a and roslin "candid and weird and perfect and sad.
