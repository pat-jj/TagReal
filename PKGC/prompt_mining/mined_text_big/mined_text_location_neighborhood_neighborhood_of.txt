 since the 2000s going forward, the growing concentration of the cantonese speaking population in [Y] have dramatically shifted to bensonhurst/gravesend and [X] creating newer chinatowns of [Y] and these newer [Y] chinatowns are known as "[Y]'s little hong kong/guangdong" due to their chinese populations being overwhelmingly cantonese populated.

 new york city's newer chinatowns have recently sprung up in elmhurst and corona, queens (which border each other and are part of the same chinatown), on avenue u in the [X] section of [Y], as well as in bensonhurst, also in [Y].

 in addition, the majority of [Y]'s cantonese population is concentrated in bensonhurst, and is slowly replacing manhattan's chinatown as the largest primary cantonese cultural center in new york city resulting in bensonhurst increasingly becoming the main largest attraction for newly arriving cantonese immigrants into new york city with [X]/sheepshead bay as a smaller secondary attraction.

 [Y]'s avenue u chinatown, which emerged as the second chinatown of [Y] during the late 1990s, is located partially in sheepshead bay and partially in nearby [X].

 for example, in new york city, cantonese still predominates in the city's older, traditional western portion of chinatown in manhattan and in [Y]'s small new chinatowns in bensonhurst and [X].

 however, due to the rapid gentrification of manhattan's chinatown and with nyc's cantonese and fuzhou populations now increasingly shifting to other chinese enclaves in the outer boroughs of nyc, such as [Y] and queens, but mainly in [Y]'s newer chinatowns, the cantonese speaking population in nyc is now increasingly concentrated in bensonhurst's little hong kong/guangdong and [X]'s little hong kong/guangdong.

 although the cantonese population is more widespread and mixed in bensonhurst and sheepshead bay/[X] with other ethnic groups, however it has in recent years surpassed the cantonese population in manhattan's chinatown and with bensonhurst having the highest concentration of cantonese speaking chinese immigrants in [Y] now, this neighborhood is slowly taking over as nyc's largest primary center of cantonese culture in addition there is a declining chinese population including chinese businesses are declining in manhattan's chinatown due to the gentrification.

 initially, sunset park was the primary destination for the newly arriving chinese immigrants, many fleeing from the original manhattan's chinatown during the 1980s-90s and most of them were cantonese speaking immigrants creating the original [Y]'s chinatown, however since the 2000s, a large influx of fuzhou speaking immigrants have become the largest chinese group population in sunset park expanding the sunset park chinatown dramatically and now being given the name, [Y]'s little fuzhou and since then, cantonese speaking immigrants in [Y] including new arrivals have been dramatically shifting to and concentrating in bensonhurst and sheepshead bay/[X] creating newer chinatowns of [Y] or [Y]'s little hong kong/guangdong.

washington and the army were surrounded on [X] with the east river to their backs.

 this delay proved to be somewhat costly, since the americans used this time to improve fortifications on northwestern long island (at [X] along the east river shoreline) and increased the size of their continental army with additional militia.

 in a well-executed manoeuvre, a large column led by howe and clinton passed around the american left flank and through the lightly guarded jamaica pass far to the east (a ridge of hills running east to west bisected the island, with a series of lower entrances that were all guarded by continentals except inexplicably to the farthest east at jamaica), catching the patriots off-guard and routing the americans from their forward positions back into the entrenchments on [X].

 historian george bilias notes that had howe attacked [X], the capture of even half of washington's army, and possibly washington himself, might have had a significant effect on the rebellion.

 the hill was used as a fort – known as "cobble hill fort", "smith's barbette", or "corkscrew fort" – during the american war of independence; the british cut off the top of the hill during their occupation, so it could not be used to look down on their headquarters in [X].
