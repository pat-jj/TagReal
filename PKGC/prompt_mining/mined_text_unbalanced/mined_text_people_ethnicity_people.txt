li yongfang's rewards for surrendering fushun to the jurchens and defecting included promotion in rank, [Y]'s granddaughter as a wife, battling along with [Y] and induction into the jin aristocracy as a chinese frontiersman, which was different from how [Y] handled both the han transfrontiersmen who assimilated into [X] identity and captured han bondservants.
