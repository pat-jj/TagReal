in 1994, upon entering italian politics, media tycoon <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> promised that he would sell his assets in fininvest (later <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>), because of the conflict of interest it would have generated, a promise he repeated a number of times in later years, but after 12 years and having served three terms as prime minister, he still retains ownership of his company that controls virtually all the italian private tv stations and a large number of magazines and publishing houses, which have extensively been used in favour of his political party

 <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> completes its acquisition of the metromedia group of companies, thereby launching the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

 the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>, founded by the rupert murdoch-owned <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (now owned by fox corporation), was launched on 9 october 1986 after the company purchased the television assets of metromedia; it would eventually ascend to the status of the fourth major network by 1994.

on october 31, 1995, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, which ten years earlier launched the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>, a general entertainment broadcast network that formed its own sports division in 1994 with the acquisition of the television rights to the national football conference of the national football league, entered into a joint venture with tci's liberty media, acquiring a 50% ownership interest in the company's prime sports affiliates.

 <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> (fox) – the nation's fourth-largest commercial network owned by fox corporation, fox was launched in october 1986 through former parent <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s purchase of metromedia earlier that year (two of the network's owned-and-operated stations once owned by that group at its founding had formed the hub of the old dumont television network, which existed from 1944 to 1956) and the purchase of the 20th century fox film studio, originally established in 1915 as fox film corporation by william fox and 20th century pictures founded 1933 and merged into fox film in 1935, five years after founder fox lost control.

however, in october 1986, the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> was launched as a challenge to the big three networks, with six independent stations that <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (which acquired the 20th century fox the year before) had acquired from metromedia as its cornerstone charter outlets, along with many independents owned by other companies.

 metromedia's independent stations continued to carry the merv griffin show until they were sold in early 1986 to <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> and 20th century fox, who used the stations as the nucleus of the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

in 1996, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, which formed a sports division for the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> in 1994 with the acquisition of the television rights to the national football conference of the national football league, entered into a joint venture with tci spinoff liberty media and rebranded that company's prime network affiliates under the "fox sports net" banner.

 the metromedia stations ended up becoming part of a new holding company formed by <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> called fox television stations; those stations formed the basis for the new <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> television network, which made its debut on october 9, 1986.

in march 1994, the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> (then a division of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>) entered into a partnership with minority-owned communications firm savoy pictures to form a television station ownership group called sf broadcasting.

 that august, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> announced that it would purchase channel 25, with plans to make it an owned-and-operated station of its <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>'s foundations were laid in march 1985 through <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s $255 million purchase of a 50% interest in tcf holdings, the parent company of the 20th century fox film studio.

because of its status as the strongest of cleveland's three commercial independents, in the spring of 1986, wuab was approached by <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> to become a charter affiliate of the fledgling <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

on october 9, 1986, xetv became one of the first stations outside of the original group of six television stations formerly owned by metromedia (which had been purchased by fox's parent company affiliate, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, earlier that year) to sign deals to join the newly launched <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>, becoming a charter affiliate of the network when it launched on october 6.

on may 23, 1994, in an overall deal in which network parent <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> also acquired a 20% equity interest in the company, atlanta-based new world communications signed a long-term affiliation agreement with the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

 however, due to the show's three-week broadcast hiatus prompted by fox's broadcast of the major league baseball playoff games in october, a strategy was developed by <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (the parent company of <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> and myspace) in an attempt to maintain their viewers' interest in the show.

in 1986, metromedia sold most of its television interests to <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, and kttv became a cornerstone station of the new <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

on july 29, 1994, burnham broadcasting sold wluk-tv to sf broadcasting – a joint venture of savoy communications and the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>, then a division of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> – for $38 million; the company later sold three of its other four stations (khon-tv in honolulu, wvue in new orleans and wala-tv in mobile, alabama) for $229 million on august 25 (a fifth burnham station, kbak-tv in bakersfield, california, was excluded from the deal and was instead spun off to westwind communications, a new company that was formed by several former burnham executives).

 craft initially won her case when it went to trial in 1983; although when the suit was retried on a second appeal three years later, the presiding judge ruled in favor of metromedia (which, by then, had merged into <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> after it purchased metromedia's major-market independent stations to later serve as the nuclei for the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>).

on july 25, 1986, in advance of the network's launch, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> announced that it had reached an agreement with rollins communications, in which kaut was named the oklahoma city charter affiliate of the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

because of its status as the strongest of oklahoma city market's three commercial independents, in the spring of 1986, kokh was approached by <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> to become a charter affiliate of the fledgling <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

in the summer of 1986, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> approached wilson industries about turning kcit into a charter affiliate of the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

in the summer of 1986, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> approached media south about turning kmss into a charter affiliate of the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

on october 31, 1995, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, which sought to create its own group of regional sports networks as a cable venture for fox sports, which was formed the year prior through the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>'s acquisition of the television rights to the nfl's national football conference, acquired a 50% ownership interest in liberty's u.

 before founding usa broadcasting, diller was a helper in gulf+western's failed paramount television service and <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>'s new <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> that was launched on october 9, 1986.

 global players such as <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, modern times group, central european media enterprises, <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> and others operate the biggest and most popular media outlets in the country.

for some time dating back to the preparations for its launch, rupert murdoch – chief executive officer of <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, the then-corporate parent of the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> – had wanted a major-league sports presence for his network.

 however, on july 11, 2007, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> announced that the new channel would be called fox business network (fbn), a name chosen over fox business channel due to the pre-existing (though seldom used) legal abbreviation of "fbc" for the co-owned broadcast network <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>.

the first two films in the franchise were made when abc family was co-owned by the <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (parent company of 20th century fox and the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>); and haim saban (founder of saban entertainment) as fox family.

 at the turn of the century, global players such as <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, modern times group, central european media enterprises and <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> briefly entered and consequently exited the bulgarian tv market due to shrinking revenues, political pressure and the effect of the global recession of 2008.

 in october 1985, 20th century fox (which <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> founder rupert murdoch purchased the previous year) announced the formation of <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>, an independent television system, to compete with the three major television networks.

 lópez noted that the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> saw "similar dynamics in play" when <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> (the corporate parent of fox international channels at the time of the announcement) launched the network in october 1986 against established english language networks abc, nbc and cbs; mundofox, he added, would seek to replicate fox's early years while launching against established spanish language networks univision, telemundo, and telefutura.

 on october 31, 1995, <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY>, which sought to create its own group of regional sports networks as a cable venture for fox sports, which was formed the year prior through the <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>'s acquisition of the television rights to the nfl's national football conference, acquired a 50% ownership interest in the prime network.

the company was originally founded as <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> in 1999 by tim o’reilly, <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>, and bill portelli, who also served as the company's chief executive officer.

villard had also had a hand in the large electric power business founded by <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER>, merging the edison electric light company, edison lamp company of newark, new jersey, and the edison machine works at schenectady, new york, to form the edison <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> company.

 <COMPANY>[X]</COMPANY> canada, founded by <FOUNDER>[Y]</FOUNDER> in nearby peterborough in 1892, contributed to heavy manufacturing techniques through the fabrication of large electric generators and electric motors, which were used to supply the rapidly growing canadian market for electrical generating equipment.
