recent findings : increased insight into the complex pathways that underlie both the genetic syndrome of <GENE>[X]</GENE> and the specific pathogenesis of vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> has highlighted multiple potential therapeutic targets .

there is cause for enthusiasm based on recent results with antiangiogenesis therapy in select patients with <GENE>[X]</GENE> and progressive vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> ; however , awareness of the notable risks and limitations of therapies currently in development is required .

neurofibromatosis antisense oligodeoxynucleotides induce reversible inhibition mutations in the neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene are the predominant cause in the development of sporadic <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and are also involved in the pathogenesis of meningiomas and ependymomas .

in patients with vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- vss -rrb- or identified <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutations , the mild phenotype was defined as < other intracranial tumors and < or = spinal tumors , and the severe phenotype as either > or = other intracranial tumors of > spinal tumors .

although no mutation was observed in a small set of meningiomas and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , alteration of these new genes should now be searched in other tumors with frequent allelic losses on chromosome not associated with <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutation .

<DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas occur as multiple tumors in sufferers of neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- and as solitary tumors in the general population due to the inactivation of a gene at chromosome .

individuals affected with <GENE>[X]</GENE> develop <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> at an increased frequency .

the gene for <GENE>[X]</GENE> , a syndrome typically associated with vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , is homologous with a family of genes whose members appear to play an important role in bridging the cell membrane with the intracellular cytoskeleton , including moesin , ezrin , radixin , and protein .

recent mutation analyses have revealed that the <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated not only in vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas from <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , but also in their sporadic counterparts , which represent approximately one-third of all human brain tumors .

we found three inactivating mutations of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

these results confirm the role of <GENE>[X]</GENE> in pathogenesis of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , but do not define its significance in the genesis of the other neuroectodermal tumors studied .

how the absence of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> protein may lead to the development of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , which are the major manifestations of <GENE>[X]</GENE> in patients , is not clear at present .

it is believed to act as a tumor suppressor gene based on the high frequency of loss of heterozygosity -lrb- loh -rrb- on this autosome in both sporadic and <GENE>[X]</GENE> associated <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas and the identification of inactivating mutation in <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients .

in this study we examined <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> including sporadic <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- of which are vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> obtained from <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , for mutations in of the coding exons of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene .

these results support the hypothesis that loss of function of <GENE>[X]</GENE> is a frequent and fundamental event in the genesis of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

deletion studies in sporadic and <GENE>[X]</GENE> associated <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , and the presence of inactivating mutations in <GENE>[X]</GENE> in patients suggest that it acts as a tumor suppressor gene .

in addition , the authors and others have reported that somatic <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations occur frequently in nonfamilial vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is an autosomal dominant disease which predisposes primarily to cns tumors such as <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- vestibular and spinal -rrb- , meningiomas , ependymomas and juvenile posterior lenticular opacities .

mutation analysis confirmed that inactivation of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene occurred in <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumors and a majority of sporadic <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas .

analysis of tumoral dna from sporadic <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas demonstrates complete loss of function in many cases , providing evidence that the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene acts as tumor suppressor gene .

multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in a single patient are most often seen in neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , but several recent reports suggest that schwannomatosis may also be a distinct clinical entity .

we studied the clinical , radiographic , and pathologic features of patients with multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> who did not have vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> diagnostic of <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

we studied the clinical , radiographic , and pathologic features of patients with multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> who did not have vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> diagnostic of <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

sporadic and inherited <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> were scanned for the nature , frequency , and distribution of mutations in the <GENE>[X]</GENE> locus encoding the <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumor suppressor protein on .

the data support the `` two-hit '' tumor suppressor model for formation of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and indicate that loss of <GENE>[X]</GENE> function can be achieved by truncation at various locations in the protein .

advances can be attributed to several fields , but the most important contributions have arisen from the identification of the genes responsible for the dominant inheritance of neurofibromatosis types -lrb- nf1 -rrb- and -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- and the development of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement for the early anatomic confirmation of the pathognomonic , bilateral vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

the authors suggest that advising young <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients to wait until complications develop , especially hearing loss , before diagnosing and operating for bilateral eighth nerve <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> may not always be in the best interest of the patient .

somatic <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations were detected in non-familial vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and in one of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

these results suggest that somatic mutations of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumour suppressor gene are a critical step in the pathogenesis of both familial and non-familial vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and that the mechanism of tumourigenesis complies with a ` two-hit ' mutation model .

alternative splicing of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene and its mutation analysis of breast and to investigate a potential role of <GENE>[X]</GENE> , the gene responsible for hereditary bilateral acoustic <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , during carcinogenesis of non-neurogenic tissues , we screened somatic mutations of <GENE>[X]</GENE> in breast cancers and colorectal carcinomas by an rnase protection assay coupled with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction -lrb- rt-pcr -rrb- .

the neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- tumour suppressor gene : implications beyond the the cloning of the gene that causes neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , a hereditary tumour syndrome typically associated with brain tumours such as vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas , represents another successful application of the `` positional cloning '' approach -- that is , the isolation of a hereditary disease gene of unknown function , based on the determination of its chromosomal location in the human genome .

mutation analyses have revealed that the <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumour suppressor gene is frequently mutated not only in vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and meningiomas from <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , but also in their sporadic counterparts , which represent approximately one third of all human brain tumours .

neurofibromas in nf1 and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in <GENE>[X]</GENE> or schwannomatosis are defined by distinctive molecular hits .

this mechanism could explain the clinical observation that <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients suffer from higher incidences of slowly recovering facial nerve paralysis after vestibular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> surgery .

although biallelic mutations of smarcb1 or lztr1 have been detected in the tumours of patients with schwannomatosis , the classical two-hit model of tumorigenesis is insufficient to account for <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> growth , since <GENE>[X]</GENE> is also frequently inactivated in these tumours .

a mutation at ivs1 + of the von hippel-lindau gene resulting in intron background : von hippel-lindau disease -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing the patient to a variety of malignant and benign neoplasms , most frequently <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , renal cell carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , and pancreatic tumors .

von hippel-lindau syndrome -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by renal cysts , retinal angiomas , central nervous system <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , and pancreatic cysts .

in addition , recent advances in the molecular genetics of this disorder are providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of tumourigenesis in <GENE>[X]</GENE> disease and in more common nonfamilial neoplasms such as clear cell renal carcinoma and central nervous system <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

<GENE>[X]</GENE> is a rare tumor syndrome characterized by certain types of nervous system tumors -lrb- cerebellar and spinal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> as well as retinal angiomas -rrb- , in conjunction with bilateral renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas .

in addition , somatic inactivation of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

renal cell carcinomas , <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , and pheochromocytomas , either vhl-related or sporadic , demonstrated positive staining for the <GENE>[X]</GENE> protein , which suggests that the antibody also recognizes the mutated <GENE>[X]</GENE> protein .

due to recurrent <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , a29-year-old patient without familial history of <GENE>[X]</GENE> disease was diagnosed to be at risk for the disease .

localization of expression by in situ inactivation of the von hippel-lindau -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- tumour suppressor gene is responsible not only for <GENE>[X]</GENE> disease , but also for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

germline mutations in <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , as well as somatic mutations in different tumors , including <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , have been identified , its ability to act as a tumor suppressor in vivo has been confirmed , and interaction with transcription factors elongin b and c leading to inhibition of transcriptional elongation has been demonstrated .

the mechanism underlying neovascularization and cyst formation in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and how this is linked to inactivation of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene is not known .

it is believed that inactivation of both alleles of <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene is essential in the tumorigenic processes in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> associated with <GENE>[X]</GENE> disease .

here , we analyzed cases of primary sporadic <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> for somatic mutations of <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene with single strand conformational polymorphism analyses of the tumor dnas .

our results suggest that mutations of <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene are involved in the development of at least % of sporadic central nervous system <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

chromosome allele loss was found in four tumour types -lrb- rcc , <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , phaeochromocytoma and pancreatic tumour -rrb- suggesting a common mechanism of tumourigenesis in all types of tumour in <GENE>[X]</GENE> disease .

in the patient with the chemodectoma , a cerebellar <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> became manifest yr after his initial diagnosis with pheochromocytoma , leading only then to a clinical diagnosis of von hippel-lindau disease -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

clinical characteristics predicting internal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in children with objective : to identify clinical characteristics associated with internal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in children with <GENE>[X]</GENE> , as a means of ensuring the early identification of patients at high risk for malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors developed from preexisting internal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

conclusions : several easily recognizable clinical characteristics indicate a high risk of internal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in children with <GENE>[X]</GENE> and , therefore , a need for very close monitoring .

interactive segmentation of plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tissue : method and preliminary plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pns -rrb- are a major manifestation of neurofibromatosis-1 -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , a common genetic disease involving the nervous system .

interactive segmentation of plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tissue : method and preliminary plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pns -rrb- are a major manifestation of neurofibromatosis-1 -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , a common genetic disease involving the nervous system .

background context : one hallmark of neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is the presence of multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , which are hormonally responsive and may undergo rapid growth during periods of hormonal surge .

although spinal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> occur in up to % of patients with <GENE>[X]</GENE> , they rarely cause neurologic sequelae , especially in the young .

comprehensive <GENE>[X]</GENE> , nf2 and smarcb1 mutation analyses revealed no mutation in blood lymphocytes and in schwann cells cultured from plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

consistent with knudson 's two-hit hypothesis , <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients harbouring a heterozygous germline <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutation develop <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> upon somatic mutation of the second , wild-type , <GENE>[X]</GENE> allele .

while the identification of somatic mutations in <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients has always been problematic on account of the extensive cellular heterogeneity manifested by <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , the classification of <GENE>[X]</GENE> somatic mutations is a prerequisite for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumorigenesis .

here , the known somatic mutational spectrum for the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene in a range of nf1-associated neoplasms - including peripheral nerve sheath tumours -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours , gastrointestinal stromal tumours , gastric carcinoid , juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia , glomus tumours , astrocytomas and phaeochromocytomas - have been collated and analysed .

pten and <GENE>[X]</GENE> inactivation in schwann cells produces a severe phenotype in the the genetic evolution from a benign <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> to a malignant sarcoma in patients with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- syndrome remains unclear .

schwann cells and/or their precursor cells are believed to be the primary pathogenic cell in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> because they harbor biallelic neurofibromin -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene mutations .

plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> were also less prevalent in patients with mosaic type-2 <GENE>[X]</GENE> microdeletions as compared with patients carrying constitutional -lrb- germline -rrb- type-1 <GENE>[X]</GENE> microdeletions .

by contrast , a previous study indicated a high burden of cutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- n > -rrb- in % of adult patients with germline type-1 <GENE>[X]</GENE> deletions .

the tumor suppressor disorder neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is associated with development of multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> which may grow intraneurally as plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pnf -rrb- or intracutaneously -lrb- cnf -rrb- .

role of noncoding rna anril in genesis of plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in background : neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is a tumor predisposition syndrome with a worldwide birth incidence of one in .

genetic factors unrelated to the <GENE>[X]</GENE> locus are thought to influence the number of plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pnfs -rrb- in patients with <GENE>[X]</GENE> , but no factors have been identified to date .

conclusion : identification of anril as a modifier gene in <GENE>[X]</GENE> may offer clues to the molecular pathogenesis of pnfs , particularly <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> formation , and emphasizes the unanticipated role of large noncoding rna in activation of critical regulators of tumor development .

risk factors for higher tumor volume included female gender -lrb- p = -rrb- and increasing subcutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- p = -rrb- in <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , absence of cutaneous schwannomas in nf2 patients -lrb- p = -rrb- , and increasing age in schwannomatosis patients -lrb- p = -rrb- .

hematopoietic-stromal interactions underpin the plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , a debilitating tumor arising in individuals afflicted with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , a common genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the <GENE>[X]</GENE> tumor suppressor gene .

skin-derived precursor cells as an in vitro modelling tool for the study of type the most characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is the development of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

moreover , a nullizygous population of cells that is s100beta negative is present in human <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , and <GENE>[X]</GENE> -lrb- + / - -rrb- multipotent progenitor cells are seemingly recruited to the tumor .

this evidence supports the <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> stem cell hypothesis and a putative involvement of skps in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease , suggesting that skps could become a valuable tool for the in vitro study of <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

phase i trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with background : sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth of plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pn -rrb- in children with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of cutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , multiple cafd-au-lait spots and pigmented nodules of the iris known as lisch nodules .

plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> are a major cause of morbidity in individuals with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

a role for the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene in solitary plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> has never been described .

in this study , we report a boy who was diagnosed with a plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , without other <GENE>[X]</GENE> diagnostic criteria .

we conclude that biallelic <GENE>[X]</GENE> inactivation was at the origin of the isolated plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in this patient .

treatment of diffuse <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- not associated with <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is often surgical resection .

in this report , we presented an adult patient , without <GENE>[X]</GENE> diagnosed , who developed invalidate status of left upper limb due to a giant diffuse <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> involving the left brachial plexus , with a high growth diffuse pattern and plexiform architecture imagistic , grossly and without results at both surgical interventions .

plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> of the eye region occurring in patients without purpose : the purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pn -rrb- of the eye region and neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

patients affected by <GENE>[X]</GENE> typically present with cutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , cafe au lait spots and eye involvement , but they can also be affected by various visceral tumors , such as <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- nodular or plexiform type -rrb- , gastrointestinal stromal tumors or endocrine tumors , such as pheochromocytomas .

the <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> is the hallmark lesion of <GENE>[X]</GENE> that develops from peripheral nerves .

genetic alterations in a malignant schwannoma from a patient with in a patient with neurofibromatosis -lrb- von recklinghausen disease ; <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , normal lymphocytes , five cutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , and tumour tissue from a recurrence of a malignant schwannoma were analysed for genetic alterations .

our data indicate that the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene may function as a tumour suppressor gene , and that , either by effect of dose reduction or complete inactivation , both the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene and the tp53 gene may be critical for the progression of a <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> to a malignant schwannoma .

immunoblotting also revealed positive expression of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene product in the brain , the normal peripheral nerves , and of enu-induced <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

neuroblastoma growth factors derived from <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- : participation of human glioma cell extracts were found to elicit a marked growth-promoting activity on human neuroblastoma cells .

this activity was also detected in the extracts of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> ; von recklinghausen neurofibromatosis -rrb- comprising aberrant schwann cell growth .

identification of <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutations in both alleles of a dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

a hallmark clinical feature of neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is multiple dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , benign tumours that typically appear in early adolescence and increase in numbers throughout life .

even though accumulating evidence demonstrates that <GENE>[X]</GENE> acts as a tumour suppressor in some cells , mutations have not been identified in both <GENE>[X]</GENE> alleles in dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

in contrast to these reports , colman et al. demonstrated <GENE>[X]</GENE> loh of dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> derived from of <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , yet the constitutional <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutations in these patients were not identified , and the extent of the somatic deletions beyond the <GENE>[X]</GENE> locus were not established .

in this study , we show that a dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> from an <GENE>[X]</GENE> individual who has a constitutional deletion of the entire <GENE>[X]</GENE> locus harbours a deletion of <GENE>[X]</GENE> exon in the other allele .

this is the first definitive identification of a somatic mutation which is limited to the <GENE>[X]</GENE> locus in a benign <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> from an <GENE>[X]</GENE> individual in whom the constitutional <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutation is known .

all five patients with deletions were remarkable for exhibiting a large number of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> for their age , suggesting that deletion of an unknown gene in the <GENE>[X]</GENE> region may affect tumor initiation or development .

findings previously unreported in <GENE>[X]</GENE> included an aqueductal web resulting in hydrocephalus , intraocular <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> resulting in retinal detachment , and asymptomatic enlargement of the septum pellucidum .

regulation of neurofibromin expression in rat sciatic nerve and cultured schwann loss of function mutations at the <GENE>[X]</GENE> locus may act intrinsically in schwann cells to cause the formation of benign schwann cell tumors -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- in patients with type neurofibromatosis .

novel alleles , hemizygosity and deletions at an alu-repeat within the neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- -lrb- von recklinghausen -rrb- is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterised by the presence of peripheral <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , cafe-au-lait spots and lisch nodules of the iris .

ras-gtp levels were increased in <GENE>[X]</GENE> neurogenic sarcomas -lrb- times -rrb- and benign <GENE>[X]</GENE> <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- four times -rrb- , compared to non <GENE>[X]</GENE> schwannomas .

the majority of tumors occurring in patients with <GENE>[X]</GENE> are benign <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , sarcomatous transformation is uncommon and most often occurs within the larger plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

the molecular basis of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> development in <GENE>[X]</GENE> is loss of expression of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene and its gene product , neurofibromin , resulting in elevated levels of ras-guanosine triphosphate .

<GENE>[X]</GENE> is characterized by the appearance of cafe-au-lait spots and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in addition to iris hamartomas , or lisch nodules , of the eye , during the first and second decades .

neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , also called von recklinghausen disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis , is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterised by multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , cafe au lait spots , and lisch nodules of the iris , with a variable clinical expression .

the most common symptomatic manifestation of <GENE>[X]</GENE> is the plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

repression of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene by tax may expain the development of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in in familial neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , individuals with a germ line-transmitted <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutation develop multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

to explain the observation that transgenic mice expressing the human t-lymphotropic virus type -lrb- htlv-1 -rrb- tax gene under the control of the viral regulatory element also develop multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , we demonstrate that the tax trans-regulator can functionally repress <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene expression through a cis-acting element located immediately upstream of its transcriptional start site , thereby allowing the development of benign <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> without the need for direct mutations in <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

a typical alteration observed in <GENE>[X]</GENE> is the eyelid plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , often associated with facial homolateral hypertrophy .

a neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is a common , autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a variety of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations -lrb- such as cafe au lait spots -rrb- , lisch nodules , plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , skeletal abnormalities , an increased risk for malignancy , and the development of learning disabilities .

to test for loss of heterozygosity -lrb- loh -rrb- at the neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene locus , three intragenic polymorphic markers were analyzed after polymerase chain reaction amplification , starting from single sc isolated from primary cultures of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , of five informative <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients .

the detection of contiguous gene deletions at the neurofibromatosis locus with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is a common genetic disorder characterized primarily by the development of multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and pigmentary changes .

fish studies performed with p1-9 , p1-12 , and a set of overlapping cosmid clones mapping telomeric to the <GENE>[X]</GENE> locus identified large deletions in two new neurofibromatosis type patients who , like previously characterized deletion patients , had mildly dysmorphic facial features and large numbers of cutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

scanning the first part of the neurofibromatosis type gene by rna-sscp : neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- of von recklinghausen is a common autosomal dominant disorder , characterized by peripheral <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , cafe-au-lait spots and lisch nodules of the iris .

characteristics which the two main forms <GENE>[X]</GENE> and nf2 have in common are a positive family history , characteristic skin alterations , such as cafe au lait macules , axillary or inguinal freckling and neural tumors such as <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and optic glioma -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- as well as -lrb- bilateral -rrb- vestibular schwannomas -lrb- nf2 -rrb- .

a novel mutation in <GENE>[X]</GENE> is associated with diverse intra-familial phenotypic neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- is a dysregulated neurocutaneous disorder , characterized by <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and cafe-au-lait spots .

dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type one -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , and their developmental origin still unsolved .

although <GENE>[X]</GENE> loss is required for <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> initiation , some features of these benign tumors resemble a skin injury state and cutaneous trauma or other insults might support tumor development .

since adult terminal schwann cells ensheathing nerve endings are able to dedifferentiate into a progenitor-like state in response to nerve crushing , we hypothesized that dedifferentiation of <GENE>[X]</GENE> - / - schwann cells could be at the origin of human dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

we posit that onset of nerve regeneration might have a role in dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> initiation via dedifferentiation of <GENE>[X]</GENE> - / - schwann cells .

using a qualitative approach to conceptualize concerns of patients with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pnfs -rrb- are associated with a variety of symptoms and concerns that affect patients ' quality of life -lrb- qol -rrb- , highlighting the value of incorporating the patients ' perspective when evaluating treatment outcomes .

patient was a woman with <GENE>[X]</GENE> and a progressive low grade mpnst developing from a diffuse/plexiform orbital <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> that arose in childhood .

because we now know that the presence of cafe-au-lait macules and freckling might not distinguish between <GENE>[X]</GENE> and other conditions such as legius syndrome , definitive <GENE>[X]</GENE> was defined as the presence of cafe-au-lait macules with or without freckling plus one of the following : lisch nodules , <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , bone dysplasia , optic pathway glioma , or familial history of <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

sleep and pulmonary outcomes for clinical trials of airway plexiform objective : plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- pns -rrb- are complex , benign nerve sheath tumors that occur in approximately % % of individuals with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

children with <GENE>[X]</GENE> are particularly at risk for the development of tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system , such as <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors , and low-grade astrocytomas of the optic pathway and other brain regions .

<GENE>[X]</GENE> is generally complicated with one or more neurobehavioral disorders or tumors located in the peripheral nervous system such as <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , peripheral nerve sheath tumor , pheochromocytoma , etc. .

orofacial manifestations in <GENE>[X]</GENE> have been documented before but occurrence of multifocal intraosseous -lrb- io -rrb- and extraosseous -lrb- eo -rrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> is rare .

the present case highlights the importance of imaging findings in the diagnosis and management of multifocal jaw , infratemporal , and parotid <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> with muscular hypoplasia in an eight-year-old girl with <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

deregulation of ras signaling in neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- results in the development of multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , complex tumor of the peripheral nerves with no effective medical treatment .

there is increasing evidences that <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> initiates through loss of <GENE>[X]</GENE> function in the schwann cell lineage , followed by a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the surrounding tumor microenvironment .

in <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> always develop along peripheral nerves and do not migrate to distant organs , including the central nervous system .

his past and family histories were unremarkable ; however , small <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and cafe au lait spots all over his body led to the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

cutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> are the hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

the results led us to speculate that the development of cutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> includes the recruitment of multipotent <GENE>[X]</GENE> -lrb- + / - -rrb- precursor cells .

this patient had been previously diagnosed with <GENE>[X]</GENE> on the basis of multiple cal macules and suspected subcutaneous <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

the most common and important problems in <GENE>[X]</GENE> are cognitive impairment , optic pathway gliomas , plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , and orthopaedic issues .

among <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients , mia serum levels were significantly higher in those with plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and in those with large number of cutaneous -lrb- > -rrb- or subcutaneous -lrb- > -rrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> than in patients without such tumours .

different patterns of mast cells distinguish diffuse from encapsulated multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> are cardinal features of neurofibromatosis -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- .

mast cells are present in most <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and have been shown to be critical to the origin and progression of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in both human <GENE>[X]</GENE> and relevant mouse models .

a total of finnish patients with <GENE>[X]</GENE> , including four patients with plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> of the cranial nerve , and their age - and gender-matched controls , were enrolled in the study .

these neoplasms , which are termed dermal and plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> respectively , have distinct clinical courses ; of particular note , plexiform , but not dermal , <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> often undergo malignant progression to form malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors -lrb- mpnsts -rrb- , the most common malignancy occurring in <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients .

these models have been designed to address key questions including : -lrb- -rrb- whether <GENE>[X]</GENE> loss in the schwann cell lineage is essential for tumorigenesis ; -lrb- -rrb- what cell type -lrb- s -rrb- in the schwann cell lineage gives rise to dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and mpnsts ; -lrb- -rrb- how the tumor microenvironment contributes to neoplasia ; -lrb- -rrb- what additional mutations contribute to neurofibroma-mpnst progression ; -lrb- -rrb- what role different neurofibromin-regulated ras proteins play in this process and -lrb- -rrb- how dysregulated growth factor signaling facilitates pns tumorigenesis .

we report the first case of a plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> from a <GENE>[X]</GENE> patient containing exclusively lipoblast-like cells exhibiting morphological and immunohistochemical features identical to univaculoted lipoblasts typically seen in myxoid liposarcoma .

little is known about the origin and nature of atypical <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in <GENE>[X]</GENE> patients .

exceptions are cases reporting the in-frame microdeletion c. , presenting with the typical pigmentary features of <GENE>[X]</GENE> , but no cutaneous or plexiform <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

we confirm the association of the c. mutation in <GENE>[X]</GENE> with a particular clinical phenotype , especially with lack of detectable <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

in the absence of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , starting <GENE>[X]</GENE> testing with the screening of exon may be worthwhile .

we report the detailed clinical presentation and molecular features of a spinal neurofibromatosis familial case where a woman , presenting with multiple bilateral spinal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> and no other clinical feature of neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , inherited a paternal large multiexonic deletion -lrb- c. - ?

dissecting loss of heterozygosity -lrb- loh -rrb- in neurofibromatosis type dermal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -lrb- dnfs -rrb- are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system typically associated with neurofibromatosis type -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- patients .

genes controlling the integrity of the dna are likely to influence the number of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> developed because dnfs are caused by somatic mutational inactivation of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene , frequently evidenced by loss of heterozygosity -lrb- loh -rrb- .

the bi-allelic inactivation of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene through a `` second hit '' seems to be of crucial importance to the development of certain manifestations , such as <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , cafe-au-lait macules , and glomus tumors .

the amplification status of her2 , c-myc , <GENE>[X]</GENE> and fgfr1 was generally similar in the matched invasive and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> components of the same tumors .

in this study , we detected cyclind1 expression using immunohistochemistry and <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene copy number using fluorescence in situ hybridization -lrb- fish -rrb- in invasive breast cancers with foci ductal carcinoma in situ -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

interestingly , when comparing the infiltrating and non-invasive areas for the same tumour , we found three cases with <GENE>[X]</GENE> amplification in the infiltrating areas but not in the <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> areas .

our data also suggest that chk1 deletion is an early genetic event in the development of breast cancer and can be detected at the <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> stage , whereas <GENE>[X]</GENE> amplification is more likely to be associated with tumour progression .

substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer -lrb- such as brca1 and <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- , as well as a precursor lesion of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma , which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies .

-lsb- oncopathological aspects of brca1 and <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes inactivation in tumors of ovarian carcinoma represents a heterogeneous group of malignant epithelial tumors which could be divided into two fundamental groups : type i -lrb- endometrioid carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma , low grade serous carcinoma , mucinous carcinoma and more rare seromucinous carcinoma and malignant brenner tumor -rrb- and type ii -lrb- high grade serous carcinoma - <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

<DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> associated with <GENE>[X]</GENE> but not brca1 mutations had significantly lower pnn compared to <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in non-carriers -lrb- % vs. % , p = -rrb- .

increased amount of knowledge about the role of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene and its protein product in fap play an important role in revealing the molecular nature of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors .

ctnnb1 genotyping and <GENE>[X]</GENE> screening in pediatric <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors : a proposed <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> fibromatosis is a rare , locally aggressive fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumor that occasionally involves children .

we examined a series of pediatric <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> for ctnnb1 mutations , seen in sporadic tumors , and <GENE>[X]</GENE> germline mutations , associated with familial adenomatous polyposis -lrb- fap -rrb- .

germline <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutations were present in -lrb- % -rrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> patients .

we present the physical history , clinical presentation , diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a novel germline <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutation , the w421x mutation , which resulted in fap presenting with about a hundred colorectal polyps , gastric hyperplastic polyps and multiple aggressive intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors .

because germline <GENE>[X]</GENE> analysis is not routinely performed in children with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours , the diagnosis fap may escape detection .

the aim of this study is to form guidelines for the identification of possible <GENE>[X]</GENE> germline mutation carriers among children with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours , based on ctnnb1 mutation analysis and immunohistochemical analysis -lrb- ihc -rrb- for beta-catenin .

patients and methods : we performed ihc of beta-catenin and mutation analysis of ctnnb1 and <GENE>[X]</GENE> in paediatric <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours , diagnosed between and in the erasmus mc , rotterdam .

using an msc cell line derived from an fap-associated <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumor , we confirmed an expected loss in the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- and the transcriptional repressor bmi-1 while documenting the coexpression of markers for chondrocytes , adipocytes , and osteocytes .

together , our findings argue that <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors result from the growth of mscs in a wound healing setting that is associated with deregulated wnt signaling due to <GENE>[X]</GENE> loss .

this study investigated the risk of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> in fap , the relation between specific <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> formation , and the clinical characteristics of fap patients with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

<GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations were similar in families with and without <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

<DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> development was not linked to specific <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations and was not found predominantly in women .

hereditary <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> disease due to a frameshift mutation at codon of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors are slowly growing fibrous tumors highly resistant to therapy and often fatal .

no ' <GENE>[X]</GENE> mutations were detected in two patients with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours and a family history of colorectal cancer and polyps .

fap is caused by mutations in the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene and various genotype-phenotype relationships have been defined including reports that colorectal polyposis is less severe with mutations ' to codon and that the risk of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours is high in fap patients with <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations between codons and .

there is relatively little information on the phenotype of <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations ' to codon ; however , one large family has been reported with a mutation at codon which presents with a highly variable phenotype which includes <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> disease .

these findings demonstrate -lrb- i -rrb- that fap and fif are allelic , and -lrb- ii -rrb- that <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene mutations which truncate the <GENE>[X]</GENE> protein distal to the beta-catenin binding domain are associated with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours , absent chrpe and variable but attenuated polyposis expression .

coexistence of somatic and germ-line mutations of <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors from <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors , which are locally invasive with recurrence but without metastasis , are frequently observed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis after abdominal surgery or during pregnancy .

conclusions : these findings are compatible with the presence of a `` second hit '' inactivation of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene and implicate this gene in the pathogenesis of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors .

introduction : gardner 's syndrome is the association of familial adenomatous polyposis -lrb- fap -rrb- with an anaphase promoting complex -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene mutation and several extradigestive manifestations : osteomas , epidermal cysts and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours .

in cases with limited numbers of colonic polyps and <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , afap may be caused by a mutation in the ' region of <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

extracolonic findings associated with fap that were most likely to prompt <GENE>[X]</GENE> testing in an otherwise asymptomatic year-old child with a negative family history were multiple <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumors , congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium -lrb- chrpe -rrb- , jaw osteomas , and hepatoblastoma .

hereditary <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> tumours arise in individuals affected by either familial adenomatous polyposis -lrb- fap -rrb- or hereditary <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> disease -lrb- hdd -rrb- carrying germline mutations in <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

as predicted by the <GENE>[X]</GENE> germline mutations among these patients , a high percentage -lrb- % -rrb- of fap-associated <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> showed loss of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> region at , which was infrequently -lrb- % -rrb- seen among sporadic tumours .

case of pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia presenting as extramedullary tumor background : acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is a malignant subtype of acute myeloid leukemia caused by the pml-retinoic acid receptor -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- alpha fusion gene .

the most frequent is the t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q22 ; q21 -rrb- , which fuses the pml and <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes , giving rise to acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

the observation that particular regions of the pml and <GENE>[X]</GENE> loci are susceptible to topoii-mediated dna damage induced by epirubicin and mitoxantrone may underlie the propensity of these agents to cause <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

characterization of cryptic rearrangements , deletion , complex variants of pml , acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is characterized by a reciprocal translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q22 ; q21 -rrb- leading to the disruption of promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- pml -rrb- and retionic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- followed by reciprocal pml-rara fusion in % of the cases .

in the present study , besides diagnostic approach we sought to analyze these cases for identification and characterization of cryptic rearrangements , deletion variants and unknown <GENE>[X]</GENE> translocation variants by application of d-fish and <GENE>[X]</GENE> break-apart probe strategy on interphase and metaphase cells in a large series of cases of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

the cell biology of disease : acute promyelocytic leukemia , arsenic , and pml acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is driven by a chromosomal translocation whose product , the pml/retinoic acid -lrb- ra -rrb- receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- fusion protein , affects both nuclear receptor signaling and pml body assembly .

in the <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> cell line nb4 , the pml gene is fused with the <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene due to a chromosomal rearrangement .

interferon augments pml and pml/rar alpha expression in normal myeloid and acute the pml gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- in the acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- ; translocation .

localization of the chromosome breakpoints and expression of multiple pml-rar translocation -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q22 ; q12-q21 -rrb- is a chromosome aberration specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- , that generates a chimeric gene between the promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- pml -rrb- gene on chromosome and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene , on chromosome .

in addition , a new variant , t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q32 ; q12 -rrb- , with a <GENE>[X]</GENE> rearrangement was described in a child with atypical <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

whereas <GENE>[X]</GENE> rearrangement appears sufficient for an apl-like phenotype , it seems that the presence of a classical pml/rara is required for typical <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> with response to atra .

in many <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> patients , translocation between <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene and an oncogenic gene , pml , can be detected , although the roles of their fusion products -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha-pml and pml-rar alpha -rrb- in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> induction have not been understood .

the t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation , specifically associated with the human acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- , fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- to a novel gene pml generating the hybrid protein pml-rar .

in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , one of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes , <GENE>[X]</GENE> , is fused to pml in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- .

in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , one of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes , <GENE>[X]</GENE> , is fused to pml in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- .

the pml-rar alpha gene product of the t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation inhibits retinoic acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is characterized by an arrest of granulocytic differentiation and a reciprocal t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation fusing the pml gene to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene .

retinoic acid regulates aberrant nuclear localization of pml-rar alpha in acute acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is characterized by a specific t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation that fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- to a novel gene product , pml .

pml , a ring-finger protein , participates in the disruption of normal myeloid differentiation when fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- by the translocation between chromosomes -lrb- chrs -rrb- and in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

all-trans retinoic acid -lrb- ra -rrb- induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- presumably by binding directly to <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> cells .

to determine if alterations of the ligand binding domain of <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha might be involved in several malignant hematologic disorders , the mutational status of this region -lrb- exons , , and -rrb- was examined in samples that included a variety of cell lines and fresh cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes -lrb- mds -rrb- and acute myeloid leukemias -lrb- aml -rrb- , including <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> patients , of whom were resistant to ra and who was refractory to ra at diagnosis , using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism -lrb- pcr-sscp -rrb- analysis and dna sequencing .

detection of pml/retinoic acid receptor a gene rearrangements by polymerase chain breakpoints of the ; translocation in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- have been identified within pml and retinoic acid receptor a -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- genes in chromosomes and , respectively .

in this study , pcr analysis using genomic dna of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> cells is proved to be useful for identifying the breakpoints of the pml and the <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes .

a rational biologic basis for safe sexual conduct in preventing the spread of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for pml-rar alpha fusion chromosome translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- specifically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- results in cleavage in the introns of pml gene on chromosome and in the intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene on chromosome , creation and expression of pml-rar alpha and <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha-pml fusion genes .

-lrb- -rrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> is not a homogeneous disease in that among patients studied at the molecular level , although a pml-rara fusion gene was detected in cases , one had a variant translocation t -lrb- ; -rrb- bearing fusion gene plzf-rara , one presented no obvious structural alteration of the pml gene while the <GENE>[X]</GENE> gene was rearranged , and three patients had no rearrangement of either pml or <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes .

<DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> is characterized by three distinct and unique features : i -rrb- accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features ; ii -rrb- invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- locus ; iii -rrb- exquisite sensitivity of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> blasts to the differentiating action of retinoic acid -lrb- ra -rrb- .

functional analysis of the various fusion proteins as well as <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha partners is revealing strikingly common features beneath a misleading structural heterogeneity which unravels a possible unifying molecular mechanism towards <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> leukemogenesis .

a non-classical translocation involving -lrb- retinoic acid receptor alpha -rrb- in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- almost always involves a chromosomal translocation t -lrb- -rrb- that results in the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene with a transcription factor gene called pml .

several cases of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> with t -lrb- ; -rrb- have recently been described , involving fusion of the <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene with a new zinc finger gene named plzf .

we report here a second non-classical translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- , with a rearranged <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene in a child with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

the identification of a second variant translocation involving the <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> suggests yet another <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha rearrangement related to neoplastic myelopoiesis .

which progenitor is the target cell in the development of acute promyelocytic acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is characterized by the t -lrb- ; -rrb- which involves the pml gene and the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene , and the subsequent pml/rar alpha fusion gene is a key event in the leukemogenesis of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

moreover , in the t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- , pml fusion to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- is the likely molecular basis of leukaemogenesis .

-lsb- molecular study of the mechanism of chromosomal translocation -lrb- ; -rrb- in acute molecular studies of chromosomal translocation -lrb- ; -rrb- in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- have shown that retinoic acid receptor a -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene on chromosome is juxtaposed to the pml gene on chromosome .

acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is thought to be caused by the t -lrb- -rrb- translocation that fuses the pml gene to that of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- and generates a pml/rar alpha fusion protein .

recently , clinical use of retinoic acid in acute pro-myelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- was proposed to induce complete remission in the leukemic cells , which have the t -lrb- -rrb- of chromosomal anomaly producing a different protein from the normal <GENE>[X]</GENE> .

<DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> is characterized cytogenetically by a t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation which involves both the pml gene on chromosome and the <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene on chromosome and gives rise to the pml/rar alpha fusion protein .

plzf-rar alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- which juxtaposes plzf , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to <GENE>[X]</GENE> , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- .

plzf-rar alpha fusion proteins generated from the variant t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- recently , we described a recurrent variant translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- -lrb- q23 ; q21 -rrb- , in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- which juxtaposes plzf , a gene encoding a zinc finger protein , to <GENE>[X]</GENE> , encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- .

in transient-expression assays , both the plzf -lrb- a -rrb- - <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha and plzf -lrb- b -rrb- - <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha fusion proteins like the pml-rar alpha protein resulting from the well-known t -lrb- ; -rrb- translocation in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , antagonized endogenous and transfected wild-type <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha in the presence of retinoic acid .

interferons induce normal and aberrant retinoic-acid receptors type alpha in treatment of the acute promyelocytic -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- cell line nb4 with interferon alpha -lrb- ifn -lrb- alpha -rrb- -rrb- , as well as ifn -lrb- beta -rrb- and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic-acid receptor type alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -lrb- alpha -rrb- -rrb- and the leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor pml-rar .

pml has been identified through its fusion to the <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- .

treatment of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> cells with ra , ra or analogs of <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha or rxr alpha also failed to induce apoptosis .

molecular analysis of the <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> breakpoint has revealed the involvement of the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene on chromosome and the promyelocytic leukaemia -lrb- pml -rrb- gene on chromosome .

the fusion of <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha and pml consistent with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> appears to have occurred at the distal juxtaposition of these sequences in the derivative chromosome .

fluorescence in situ hybridization -lrb- fish -rrb- using cosmidic probes specific for <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha and pml , regions did not show a fusion signal as in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> .

molecular diagnosis and monitoring of acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with the characteristic balanced ; translocation , t -lrb- ; -rrb- , of acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene on chromosome to pml , a recently described gene of unknown function , on chromosome .

acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- with break points in the -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- gene and the zyl gene also produces a fusion transcript .

these data , along with previous reports of rare variant translocations in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , indicate that while dysregulation of <GENE>[X]</GENE> by gene fusion may be essential for the <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> phenotype , the particular fusion partner may determine clinicopathological aspects , including presentation , response to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid -lrb- atra -rrb- , and prognosis .

most patients with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> express del -lrb- -rrb- - derived <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha-pml transcripts as well as the putative leukemogenic pml-rar alpha associated with add -lrb- -rrb- .

although parallel assessment of pml-rar alpha and <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha-pml can enhance minimal residual disease detection in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , this study demonstrates that treatment strategies involving determination of pcr status post-consolidation , even using <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha-pml in addition to the more conventional pml-rar alpha assay will fail to identify all patients at risk of relapse .

lysp100-associated nuclear domains -lrb- lands -rrb- : description of a new class of the pml gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- gene in t -lrb- ; -rrb- acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- , creating a pml-rar alpha fusion oncoprotein .

we describe a patient with the microgranular variant form of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , with no detectable cytogenetic abnormality of either chromosomes or , who nevertheless had juxtaposition of pml and <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes and expressed a chimeric transcript .

our results show that <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> patients with cytogenetically normal chromosomes and may , nevertheless , have involvement of both pml and <GENE>[X]</GENE> genes defining a subgroup of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , t -lrb- ; -rrb- - negative/pml-rara-positive which is analogous to philadelphia chromosome-negative/bcr-abl-positive cml .

paradoxically , <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> cells express pml-rar , an aberrant form of the retinoic acid receptor type alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- derived from the leukemia-specific t -lrb- ; -rrb- chromosomal translocation .

we show here that am580 , a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha agonist , is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in nb4 , an apl-derived cell line , and in freshly isolated <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> blasts .

clinically typical <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> without t -lrb- ; -rrb- and with the pml-rar alpha fusion transcripts or rearrangements in pml and/or <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene has been reported , suggesting submicroscopic changes at the molecular level without apparent t -lrb- ; -rrb- or observation of normal metaphases .

fusion between a novel kruppel-like zinc finger gene and the retinoic acid we have identified a unique case of acute promyelocytic leukaemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- with a t -lrb- ; -rrb- reciprocal chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha -rrb- and a previously uncharacterized zinc finger gene .

our results demonstrate for the first time the association of a variant chromosomal translocation involving the <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha gene with <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , further implicating the <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha in leukaemogenesis and also suggesting an important role for plzf as well as retinoic acid and its receptors in myeloid maturation .

demonstration of the existence , in some apl-like leukemias , of masked translocations with involvement of pml and <GENE>[X]</GENE> , thus allows to -lrb- i -rrb- confirm the diagnosis of <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> , -lrb- ii -rrb- adapt the treatment and -lrb- iii -rrb- monitor the residual disease .

because the ratio of expression of pml/rar alpha to wild-type <GENE>[X]</GENE> alpha and pml may be important in maintaining the dominant negative block of myelocytic differentiation , these data suggest a molecular mechanism for restoration by tra normal myeloid differentiation in <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> cells .

acute promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- <DISEASE>[Y]</DISEASE> -rrb- is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia -lrb- aml -rrb- that is characterized by a balanced translocation between chromosomes and -lsb- t -lrb- ; -rrb- -rsb- , which results in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia -lrb- pml -rrb- and retinoic acid receptor alpha -lrb- <GENE>[X]</GENE> -rrb- genes .
