 though dismayed at the living conditions he experienced, quisling nonetheless concluded that "the bolsheviks have got an extraordinarily strong hold on russian society" and marvelled at how [Y] had managed to mobilise the [X] forces so well; by contrast, in granting too many rights to the people of russia, the russian provisional government under alexander kerensky had brought about its own downfall.

 [Y], leading bolshevik revolutionary, founder of the [X]

 for a time, it appeared that the white army would succeed in its drive; [Y], as the supreme commander of the [X], hastily concluded an agreement with nestor makhno's anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine (the 'black army') for mutual support.

the gru's first predecessor in soviet russia was established by the secret order signed on 5 november 1918 by jukums vācietis, the first commander-in-chief of the [X] (rkka), and by ephraim sklyansky, deputy to [Y], the civilian leader of the [X].

among the commanders leading the [X] offensive were semyon budyonny, [Y], sergey kamenev, mikhail tukhachevsky (the new commander of the western front), alexander yegorov (the new commander of the southwestern front), and hayk bzhishkyan.

 in 1919, during the russian civil war, the northwestern white army advancing from estonia and led by nikolai yudenich tried to capture petrograd and even managed to reach its southern outskirts, but the attack against the [X] under [Y] ultimately failed, and yudenich retreated.

 as the bolsheviks came to power through the october revolution of november 1917, and as the russian civil war of 1917-1922 began, [Y] gradually established the [X] and set up the role of political officers.

 the communist party and the [X] - on the military commissar, [Y]

after soviet leader vladimir lenin's retirement from politics in march 1923 following a stroke, a power struggle began between soviet premier alexei rykov, pravda editor nikolai bukharin, profintern leader mikhail tomsky, [X] founder [Y], former premier lev kamenev, comintern leader grigory zinoviev, and general secretary joseph stalin.

 he was transferred to the post of chief of supply for the [X], although [Y], the people's commissar for war, regarded him as "an ambitious but talentless intriguer" who had been placed there to undermine him.

 after brief negotiations, [Y] (then the minister of war in the soviet government, and the leader of the [X]) responded by sending the army to kronstadt, along with the cheka.

in the russian civil war, [Y], leader of the [X], ordered decimation for deserters.

 hence, as [Y] remarked, the revolution should be "brought on the bayonets" (of the [X]), as "through kiev leads the straight route for uniting with the austro-hungarian revolution, just as through pskov and vilnius goes the way for uniting with the german revolution.

 [Y], in his later works, argued that while it was impossible to speak conclusively about the plot, he saw indications in stalin's mania for involvement in every detail of [X] organization and logistics that the military had real reasons for dissent, which may have eventually led to a plot.

bolshevik commanders in the [X]'s coming offensive would include mikhail tukhachevski (new commander of the western front), [Y], the future soviet ruler joseph stalin, and the founder of the cheka secret police, felix dzerzhinsky.

 vācietis was the first commander-in-chief of the [X] (rkka), a member of the revolutionary military council (2 september 1918 – 3 july 1919), forming a productive working relationship with [Y], the commissar for military and naval affairs.
