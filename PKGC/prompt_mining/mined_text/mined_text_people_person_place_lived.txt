[X] conceived the principle of recording and reproducing sound between may and july 1877 as a byproduct of his efforts to "play back" recorded telegraph messages and to automate speech sounds for transmission by telephone.

the use of a flat recording surface instead of a cylindrical one was an obvious alternative which thought-experimenter charles cros initially favored and which practical experimenter [X] and others actually tested in the late 1870s and early 1880s.

 this was followed by the wide spread use of low voltage direct current for indoor electric lighting in business and homes after inventor [X] launched his incandescent bulb based electric "utility" in 1882.

 this put westinghouse's business in direct competition with [X], who marketed direct current for electric power distribution.

 at the same time, [X] was launching the first dc electric utility designed to light homes and businesses with his patented incandescent bulb.

 this was an advantage over the low voltage dc systems being marketed by [X]'s electric utility which had a limited range due to the low voltages used.

 this competition with [Y] led in the late 1880s to what has been called the "war of currents" with [X] and his company joining in with a spreading public perception that the high voltages used in ac distribution were unsafe.

at this point the state's efforts to design the electric chair became intermixed with what has come to be known as the war of the currents, a competition between [X]'s direct current power system and george westinghouse's alternating current based system.

 technical assistance in these demonstrations was provided by [X]'s west orange laboratory and there grew to be some form of collusion between [Y] electric and brown.

 back at west orange on december 5, 1888, brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the medico-legal society including elbridge gerry who was also chairman of the death penalty commission, and [X] looking on.

association with [X]

in popular culture, topsy is often portrayed as being electrocuted in a public demonstration organized by [X] during the war of the currents to show the dangers of alternating current.

two things that may have indelibly linked [X] with topsy's death were the primary newspaper sources describing it as being carried out by "electricians of the [Y] company” (leading to an eventual confusing of the unrelated power company with the man), and the fact that the film of the event (like many [Y] films from that period) was credited on screen to "thomas a.

 however, by that time there had been numerous other patents for electrified third-rail systems, including [X]'s  of 1882, and third rails had been in successful use for over a decade, in installations including the rest of chicago 'elevateds', as well as those used in brooklyn rapid transit company, not to mention the development outside the us.

in 1878 inventor [X] saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems.

 [X]'s own colleagues and engineers were trying to get him to consider ac.

 [Y] electric had a patent option on the zbd transformer, and a confidential in house report recommended that the company go ac, but [X] was against the idea.

 as part of their fact-finding, the commission sent out surveys to hundreds of experts on law and medicine, seeking their opinions, as well as contacting electrical experts, including elihu thomson and [X].

brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted [X] to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments.

  in addition, [X] himself sent a letter to the city government of scranton, pennsylvania recommending brown as an expert on the dangers of ac.

 there on december 5, 1888 brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the medico-legal society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and [X] looking on.

 further [Y] involvement was contained in letters from [Y] treasurer hastings asking brown to send anti-ac pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of missouri (at the company's expense), brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from [X] be sent to scranton, pa, as well as [Y] and arthur kennelly coaching brown in his upcoming testimony in the kemmler appeal trial.

 this was due in part to [X] himself leaving the electric power business.

 he said, he was not interested in the decisions of the courts and that he had no hostile mind towards [X].

probably his relationship to [X] was the motivation of franklin pope.

the reputation of franklin pope and his article in the electrical engineer is the reason for the existing view in some countries that henry goebel developed a carbon filament lamp many years before [X] did it.

in a dissertation published 2007 it is stated, that the article was part of the fraudulent goebel-defense and the intention was to produce credibility for the goebel-story and sympathy for henry goebel, an "underdog" who anticipated the famous [X].
