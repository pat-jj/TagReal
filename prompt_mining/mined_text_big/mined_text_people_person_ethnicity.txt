 his position drew much criticism from the left and later postcolonial literary critics, such as edward said, who were opposed to european imperi[X]sm, and charged that camus's novels and short stories are plagued with colonial depictions - or conscious erasures - of algeria's [Y] population.

the birth of islam opposite som[X]a's red sea coast meant that som[X] merchants and sailors living on the [Y]ian peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [Y] muslim trading partners.

italy has a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comp[Y]le size, but it has a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, many of them grouped in clusters, which are the backbone of the it[X]an industry.

 the it[X]an unification saw the number of divisions increased, and in 1861 the c[Y]inieri were appointed the "first force" of the new national military organization.

 records made by industri[X]sts and technicians of the period are an incomp[Y]le source of information about their methods.

 individu[X]st anarchists followed proudhon and other anarchists that "exploitation of man by man and the domination of man over man are insep[Y]le, and each is the condition of the other", that "the bottom claim of soci[X]sm" was "that labour should be put in possession of its own", that "the natural wage of labour is its product" in an "effort to abolish the exploitation of labour by capital" and that anarchists "do not admit the government of man by man any more than the exploitation of man by man", advocating "the complete destruction of the domination and exploitation of man by man".

 by the turn of the twentieth century the shorter and purely [Y]ic term "islam" had begun to  displace it, and by 1938, when orient[X]st scholars completed the encyclopaedia of islam, islamism seems to have virtually disappeared from english usage.

a writer for the international crisis group maintains that "the conception of 'political islam'" is a creation of americans to explain the iranian islamic revolution and apolitical islam was a historical fluke of the "short-lived era of the heyday of secular [Y] nation[X]sm between 1945 and 1970", and it is quietist/non-political islam, not islamism, that requires explanation.

 madkh[X]sm originated in the 90s saudi [Y]ia, as a reaction against the rise of the salafi activism and the threat of salafi jihadism.

 shah w[X]ullah of india and muhammad ibn abd-al-wahhab of [Y]ia were contemporaries who met each other while studying in mecca.

 fundament[X]sm initially became the meeting-ground between the salafiyyah movement and the wahhäbi movement of saudi [Y]ia.

 rashid rida's islamic political theory would greatly influence many subsequent islamic reviv[X]st movements across the [Y] world.

 the defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries, was blamed on the secular [Y] nation[X]sm of the ruling regimes.

 ba'athism, [Y] soci[X]sm, and [Y] nation[X]sm suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic islamist movements inspired by maududi and sayyid qutb gained ground.

 in 1979 the grand mosque in mecca saudi [Y]ia was seized by an armed fundament[X]st group and held for over a week.

instead of prompting a backlash against the movement from which the attackers originated, however, saudi [Y]ia, already very conservative, responded by shoring up its fundament[X]st credentials with even more islamic restrictions.

it is not beyond guessing that this is the work of criminal american imperi[X]sm and international zionism despite the fact that the object of the fundament[X]sts' revolt was the kingdom of saudi [Y]ia, america's major ally in the region.

another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radic[X]ze the islamist movement was the gulf war, which brought several hundred thousand us and allied non-muslim military personnel to saudi [Y]ian soil to put an end to saddam hussein's occupation of kuwait.

 taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liber[X]zation and secularization by the ruling leftist-nation[X]st fln government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following sharia law, economic liber[X]zation and development program, education in [Y]ic rather than french, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young algerian men.

to this end it has drawn up and published a 186-article constitution for its proposed c[X]phate-state specifying specific policies such as sharia law, a "unitary ruling system" headed by a c[X]ph elected by muslims, an economy based on the gold standard, public ownership of utilities, public transport, and energy resources, death for apostates and [Y]ic as the "sole language of the state.

the connection between the lack of an islamic spirit and the lack of victory was underscored by the disastrous defeat of [Y] nation[X]st-led armies fighting under the slogan "land, sea and air" in the 1967 six-day war, compared to the (perceived) near-victory of the yom kippur war six years later.

 the united states sent 155 people, russia sent 52, 11 were japanese, eight were canadian, five were it[X]an, four were french, four were german, and there were one each from belgium, brazil, denmark, great britain, kazakhstan, malaysia, the netherlands, south africa, south korea, spain, sweden and the united [Y] emirates.

 the [Y]ic text was translated into english by the orient[X]st samuel lee and published in london in 1829.

 herodotus, writing in his histories, reported that the [Y]s worshipped orotalt (identified with dionysus) and [X]lat (identified with aphrodite).

pre-islamic [Y]ians, especially pastor[X]st tribes, sacrificed animals as an offering to a deity.

 the distribution of pagan temples supports gerald hawting's argument that [Y]ian polytheism was margin[X]zed in the region and already dying in mecca on the eve of islam.

 according to howard sachar, "the policy of the new organization was based squarely on jabotinsky's teachings: every jew had the right to enter palestine; only active ret[X]ation would deter the [Y]s; only jewish armed force would ensure the jewish state".

 the riots took the form of attacks by [Y] rioters ambushing main roads, bombing of roads and settlements as well as property and agriculture vand[X]sm.

 jewish and [Y] communities fought each other violently in campaigns of attacks, ret[X]ations, and counter-ret[X]ations which provoked around 800 deaths after two months.

 this is the unmistakable stamp of a fascist party for whom terrorism (against jews, [Y]s, and british [X]ke), and misrepresentation are means, and a "leader state" is the goal.

free jazz, and the related form of avant-garde jazz, broke through into an open space of "free ton[X]ty" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of world music from india, africa, and [Y]ia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing.
