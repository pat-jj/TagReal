 coincidentally, with ming's control in [X]ria in decline, the [X] (jurchen) tribes, under their chieftain [Y], broke away from ming's rule, and emerged as a powerful, unified state, which was later proclaimed as the qing dynasty.

1626 – yuan chonghuan is appointed governor of liaodong, after leading the chinese into a great victory against the [X]rians under [Y].

 the [X] were an already large state north of china, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [Y] suddenly united them under the eight banners—armies that the opposing families were organized into.

 as early as 1655, in the memoir of qing dynasty, volume: emperor [Y] (), it writes: "(in 1631) as [X] ministers do not comprehend the han language, each ministry shall create a new position to be filled up by han official who can comprehend the national language.

in the late sixteenth century, [Y], leader of the house of aisin-gioro, began organizing "banners" which were military-social units that included [X], han, and mongol elements.

 [Y] united clans to create a [X] ethnic identity and officially proclaimed the later jin dynasty in 1616.

what was to become the [X] state was founded by [Y], the chieftain of a minor jurchen tribethe aisin-gioroin jianzhou in the early 17th century.

 the [X] leader [Y] married one of his granddaughters to the ming general li yongfang after he surrendered fushun in liaoning to the [X] in 1618.

 in china, the collapsing ming dynasty was challenged by a series of conquests led by the [X] warlord [Y], which were consolidated by his son hong taiji and finally consummated by his grandson, the shunzi emperor, founder of the qing dynasty.

 february 2–10 – battle of ningyuan in xingcheng, liaoning, china: with a much smaller force, the ming dynasty commander yuan chonghuan defeats the [X] tribal leader [Y], who dies soon after and is succeeded by huang taiji.

 the [X] tribal leader [Y] breaks his relations with the ming dynasty of china, at this time under the aloof and growingly negligent wanli emperor; [Y]'s line later becomes the emperors of the qing dynasty, which overthrows the short-lived shun dynasty in 1644, and the remnants of the ming throne in 1662.

 april – battle of sarhu: [X] leader [Y] is victorious over the ming forces.

the eastern mongol tribes near and in [X]ria, particularly the khorchin and southern khalkha in today's inner mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the jurchen tribes until [Y], the founder of the new jin dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.

 later in 1599, the jurchen leader [Y] decided to convert the mongolian alphabet to make it suitable for the [X] people.

when the jurchens were reorganized by [Y] into the eight banners, many [X] clans were artificially created as a group of unrelated people founded a new [X] clan (mukun) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name).

 [Y] considered it a major impediment that his people lacked a script of their own, so he commanded his scholars, gagai and eldeni, to create [X] characters by reference to mongolian scripts.

dorgon was born in the [X] aisin-gioro clan as the 14th son of [Y], the khan of the later jin dynasty (the precursor to the qing dynasty).

[Y], the founder of the [X] people, routed the sibe during the battle of gure in 1593 on his way to founding the qing dynasty of china.

in 1625, the [X] leader [Y] captured shenyang and decided to relocate his entire administrative infrastructures to the city, or  hoton () as it is called in [X] language.

the range represents the mythical birthplace of bukūri yongšon, ancestor of nurgaci ([Y]) and the aisin gioro imperial family, who were the founders of both the [X] state and the qing dynasty of china.

 jurchen and [X] rulers also used the title khan (han in [X]); for example, [Y] was called genggiyen han.

 created in the early 17th century by [Y], the banner armies played an instrumental role in his unification of the fragmented jurchen people (who would later be renamed the "[X]" under [Y]'s son hong taiji) and in the qing dynasty's conquest of the ming dynasty.

 in 1635, hong taiji, son of [Y], renamed his people from jurchen to [X].

when the jurchens were reorganized by [Y] into the eight banners, many [X] clans were artificially created as a group of unrelated people founded a new [X] clan (mukun) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name).

the royal court was in a state of confusion over the possibility of a war with japan, now unified under the rule of toyotomi hideyoshi, and the unstable situation in [X]ria where a young jurchen chieftain named [Y] was gathering strength.

 around 1612, [Y] renamed his clan aisin gioro ("golden gioro" in the [X] language), both to distinguish his family from other gioro lines and to allude to an earlier dynasty that had been founded by jurchens, the jin ("golden") dynasty that had ruled northern china from 1115 to 1234.

 in the early qing era, [Y] and huangtaiji categorised [X] and han ethnic identity within the eight banners based on culture, lifestyle and language, instead of ancestry or genealogy.

 after a 1623 revolt, [Y] came to mistrust his nikan ([X]: , means "han people") followers so hong taiji began their assimilation into the country and government.

 there are many theories as to the reason for the choice of name but two of the most commonly cited are its sounding similar to the [X] word for "brave" and a possible connection with the bodhisattva manjusri, the bodhisattva of wisdom, of whom [Y] claimed to be an incarnation.

 the [X] leader [Y] married one of his granddaughters to the ming general li yongfang 李永芳 after he surrendered fushun in liaoning to the [X] in 1618.

the nanais at first fought against the [Y] and the [X]s, led by their own nanai hurka chief sosoku before surrendering to hongtaiji in 1631.

oboi was born to the [X] gūwalgiya clan, which had been distinguishing itself militarily since oboi's grandfather solgo submitted to [Y] (1559–1626) in 1588.

 under the [X] banner organization created by nurhachi, oboi's branch of the family was registered under the bordered yellow banner which came under the command of [Y]'s son hong taiji (1592–1643).

the area known as [X]ria in northeastern china was gradually conquered by the jurchen chieftain [Y].

 at the same time, ming armies were occupied in the defence of the northern border against the [X] ruler hong taiji, whose father, [Y], had united the [X] tribes into a cohesive force.

dodo was born in the [X] aisin gioro clan as the 15th son of [Y], the founder of the qing dynasty.

giocangga ([X]: ; ; 1526–1583) was the son of fuman and the paternal grandfather of [Y], the man who was to unify the jurchen peoples and begin building what later became the later jin dynasty of china.

2 million people who could potentially be patrilineal descendants of [Y], but this figure must be used with caution as there are non-[X] ethnic groups (notably koreans) who also use the surname jin (kim) for unrelated reasons.

 the [X] leader [Y] married one of his granddaughters, a daughter of abatai, to the ming general li yongfang, the ancestor of li shiyao (李侍堯).

 his son and successor hong taiji (1592–1643) renamed his people "[X]" in 1635 and changed the name of [Y]'s state from "great jin" to "great qing" in 1636.

 when [Y] died in 1626, a committee of [X] princes selected hong taiji (1592–1643) as his successor.

the process of unification of the jurchen people completed by [Y] was followed by his son's, hong taiji, energetic expansion into outer [X]ria.

according to official histories from the qing dynasty, [Y], a military leader of the jurchens of northeast china and founder of what became the qing dynasty, named his tribe after mañjuśrī as the [X]s.

 eidu (1562–1621), [X] noble, close associate of [Y]

soni's father Šose (chinese: shuose 硕色) and uncle hife (xifu 希福), who were both fluent in mandarin, mongolian and [X], served as high officials under [X] patriarch [Y] (1559–1626).

 in 1628, under [Y]'s successor hong taiji (1592–1643), soni led a successful diplomatic mission to convince the recently surrendered khorchin mongols to honor their pledge to help the [X]s militarily.

 he was the youngest of the sixteen sons of eidu (1562–1621), who had been a close associate of [X] patriarch [Y].

critics of the analogy with inner and outer mongolia, however, suggest that while mongols under the qing dynasty were a recognized ethnic group, "[X]s" were a group constructed by the chieftain [Y] in the early 17th century, mainly for the purposes of conquering the ming dynasty.

standard [X] was based on the language spoken by the jianzhou jurchens during [Y]'s time, while other unwritten [X] dialects such as that of aigun and sanjiazi were also spoken in addition to the related xibe language.

 in retaliation, a year later, a ming punitive force of about 100,000 men, which included korean and yehe troops, approached [Y]'s [X]s along four different routes.

 the [X]s scored successive victories, the most decisive being the battle of sarhu in which [Y] defeated ming dynasty and korean troops that were far superior in numbers and armaments.

 the war also indirectly weakened china's position in [X]ria, which gave the fledgling [X] chieftain [Y] an opportunity to expand his influence and territory.

 the unification of the jianzhou jurchens became a stepping stone for [Y] to expand his power throughout southern and central [X]ria, and to create a truly unified [X] state.

 [Y] married one of his granddaughters to the ming general li yongfang after he surrendered the city of fushun in liaoning in 1618 and a mass marriage of han chinese officers and officials to [X] women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by prince yoto and hongtaiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.

 [Y], the first [X] ruler, was born in today's xinbin [X] autonomous county.

 many years later, long after hong taiji had renamed jurchens to [X]s, and both wan and [Y] were dead, qing historians referred to wan as one of the first great leaders of the "[X] nations".

 when it came to the 1600s, the [X] rose from the northeast of china, [Y], the khan of later jin, announced his rebellion against the ming dynasty in the 1610.

  as  yuan chonghuan  defend  ningyuan  and  jinzhou  from  [X]’s  invasion  for many   times,   hong   taiji,   the   following   khan   of   [Y],   bypassed ningyuan and jinzhou and broke the great wall and reach the capital.

empress xiaoliewu (1590 – 1 october 1626), of the [X] plain white banner ula nara clan, personal name abahai, was a consort of [Y].

 han yun, who participated in the rebellion of yi gwal, fled to [X]ria and urged the later jin ruler [Y] to attack joseon; thus the friendly relationship between the later jin and joseon ended.

 nikan wailan ([X]: ᠨᡳᡴᠠᠨ ᠸᠠᡳᠯᠠᠨ) a jurchen leader affiliated with the ming dynasty and a rival of [Y].

 [Y] (king), or possibly his translators erdeni and gagai ? - [X]rians, created [X] alphabet in 1599.

 xingcheng's city walls have stood since they were first constructed in 1428 and were instrumental in helping the ming defeat the great [X] commander [Y] at the pivotal battle of ningyuan in 1626.

when the jurchens were reorganized by [Y] into the eight banners, many [X] clans were artificially created as a group of unrelated people founded a new [X] clan (mukun) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name).

the hada and hoifa clans fell from prominence after [Y]'s [X]rian conquest, whereas ula and yehe survived the defeat and integrated into qing's banner aristocracy.

daišan was born in the [X] aisin gioro clan as the second son of [Y], the founder of the qing dynasty.

duanhua was born in the [X] aisin gioro clan as the third son of ulgungga (烏爾恭阿), a descendant of jirgalang, a nephew of [Y] (the founder of the qing dynasty).

 the [X]s gave extensive titles and honors and marriage to aisin gioro women to pre-1644 han defectors, like the marriage of [Y]'s granddaughter to li yongfang and his sons registered in the chinese plain blue banner (hanjun, or han banner), and the title granted to the son of a ming defector, sun sike (sun ssu-k'o) in the chinese plain white banner, (hanjun, or han banner) and the marriage of one of kangxi's daughters to his son.

 [Y] used culture to categorize people and allowed han transfrontiersmen to identify as [X] after assimilating, and ethnicity was regarded as flexible when han chinese and mongols families were moved by kangxi to [X] banners from their original mongol and chinese banners (hanjun, or han banners) .

li yongfang's rewards for surrendering fushun to the jurchens and defecting included promotion in rank, [Y]'s granddaughter as a wife, battling along with [Y] and induction into the jin aristocracy as a chinese frontiersman, which was different from how [Y] handled both the han transfrontiersmen who assimilated into [X] identity and captured han bondservants.

 the han chinese gong zhenglu (gong zhengliu) who was abducted in the 1580s by the jurchens from liaodong with tens of thousands of others, originally came from shaoxing in zhejiang became a close confidant of [Y] and tutoring his sons, adopting the [X] name onoi, and being showered with wives, slaves, and a house by [Y].

the [X] leader [Y] embarked on the conquest of liaodong from the ming dynasty, luring han chinese to his side to defect by threatening them with destruction and at the same time also promising them rewards, with important positions.

the han who classified in different ways had come under [X] rule in three different eras, before 1618 the han "transfrontiersmen" who threw in their lot with [Y] were effectively only han chinese by ancestry and blood since they practiced jurchen culture and became part of [X] companies (niru) within [X] banners, while from 1618-1622 the han captured in liaodong and liaoxi became either bondservants to [X] banners or han bannermen, and then finally the han who deserted the ming during hong taiji's rule to join the [X], and these were first placed into separate all han companies (niru) attached to [X] banners, and then when in 1642 the [X] banners ejected all their han companies they were placed into separate chinese banners (hanjun, or han banners) since they were the mostly not assimilated to jurchen culture.

 the [X] banners had two main divisions between the higher ranking "old [X]s" (fo manzhou, fe manju) made out of the main jurchen tribes like the jianzhou whom [Y] and hong taiji created the [X] banners from, and the lower ranking "new [X]s" (chinese transliteration: 伊車滿洲.

xi qia was an ethnic [X] (plain blue banner) of the imperial clan of aisin gioro as a direct descendant of murhaci (穆爾哈齊), a younger half-brother of [Y] and second son of taksi, thus, making him a member of the collateral bloodline of the aisin gioro clan.

 through her father, ziwei is a descendant of genghis khan, eidu, [Y], and other prominent figures in [X] and mongolian history.

with his death, the independent existence of the yehe tribe came to an end and the last of the jurchen tribes under the hūlun (alliance) were brought under the control of [Y], but many of its members, including his descendants, became prominent in the service of [Y] and of the succeeding [X] emperors.

 in 1601, [Y] had organized [X] society into four "banners" that were doubled in number in 1615 to become the eight banners.

 [Y]'s eight sons were known collectively as the "princes who deliberate on government" ( yìzhèng wáng; [X]: doro jafaha beise).

another precursor to the council was a group of "five high officials" and "ten judges" (jarguci), all [X], that [Y] put in charge of administrative and judicial tasks in 1615 or 1616.

what was to become the [X] state was founded by [Y], the chieftain of a minor jurchen tribethe aisin gioroin jianzhou in the early 17th century.

when the jurchens were reorganized by [Y] into the eight banners, many [X] clans were artificially created as a group of unrelated people founded a new [X] clan ([X]: mukūn) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name).

some other important contributions by [Y] include ordering the creation of a written [X] script, based on mongolian script, after the earlier jurchen script was forgotten (it had been derived from khitan and chinese).

 [Y] also created the civil and military administrative system that eventually evolved into the eight banners, the defining element of [X] identity and the foundation for transforming the loosely-knitted jurchen tribes into a single nation.

 in the late 16th century the hurka tribe dominated the region before being defeated by the [X] leader [Y].

one of the keys to [Y]'s successful unification of jurchen tribes and his challenge to the ming dynasty in the early seventeenth century was the formation of the eight banners, a uniquely [X] institution that was militarily efficient, but also played economic, social, and political roles.

 soon after defeating the chahar mongols with the help of other mongol tribes in 1635, [Y]'s son and successor hong taiji incorporated his new mongol subjects and allies into the mongol eight banners, which ran parallel to the original [X] banners.

" in [Y]'s era and the early hong taiij era, these princes formed the ruling council of the [X] nation as well as high command of the army.

 in 1618, the upstart jianzhou jurchen leader [Y] united the tribes of [X]ria and declared war on the ming.

[Y] and huangtaiji both viewed ethnic identity in terms of culture, language and attitude: mongols were associated with the mongol language, nomadism and horses; [X]s were associated with the [X] language and participation in the banners; han chinese were associated with liaodong, the han language, agriculture and commerce.

 "qing" is also the name of several rivers in [X]ria, at one of which [Y] won a key battle in 1619.

in 1583, [X] chieftain [Y] began to unify the jurchen ministries.

 at the same time, the [X] did not originally possess the advanced technological or bureaucratic systems that the han chinese did, nor did the [X] originally have their own writing system (which would develop during the formation of the qing under [Y] and others).

manggūltai was born in the [X] aisin gioro clan as the fifth son of [Y], the founder of the qing dynasty.
