Recently , the human excision repair gene [X] has been shown to correct the UV sensitivity of [Y] fibroblasts .

In this work we describe the effect of [X] on the DNA repair deficient phenotype of [Y] and on two repair-defective TTD cell strains -LRB- TTD1VI and TTD2VI -RRB- assigned by complementation analysis to group D of XP .

These data show that a functional [X] gene is sufficient to reestablish a wild-type DNA repair phenotype in TTD1VI and TTD2VI cells , confirming the genetic relationship between TTD and [Y] .

Furthermore , our findings suggest that mutations at the [X] locus are responsible for causing a similar phenotype in TTD and [Y] cells in response to UV irradiation , but produce quite different clinical symptoms .

Somatic mosaicism for oncogenic [X] mutations in juvenile myelomonocytic Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a rare pediatric myeloid neoplasm characterized by excessive proliferation of myelomonocytic cells .

Somatic mutations in genes involved in GM-CSF signal transduction , such as [X] , KRAS , PTPN11 , NF1 , and CBL , have been identified in more than % of children with [Y] .

In the present study , we report patients with somatic mosaicism for oncogenic [X] mutations -LRB- G12D and G12S -RRB- associated with the development of [Y] .

The clinical course of these patients suggests that [X] mosaicism may be associated with a mild disease phenotype in [Y] .

The strange case of the lost [X] mutation in a child with juvenile Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder of early childhood characterized by mutations of the RAS-RAF-MAP kinase signaling pathway .

We report the case of a child with a diagnosis of [Y] carrying two mutations of [X] gene -LRB- c. > C and c. > A -RRB- independently occurring in long-term culture initiating cells .

None of the [Y] patients for which germline DNA was available had a constitutional [X] mutation .

Since mutations in the [X] gene have been found at high frequencies in CMMoL , but only rarely in CML , we analyzed mutations activating the [X] gene in patients with [Y] .

These data suggest that [X] gene mutations may be involved in the pathogenesis and/or prognosis of [Y] and provide further evidence that [Y] is an entity distinct from CML .

Conversely , patients with [Y] and neurofibromatosis type , somatic PTPN11 , KRAS , and most of those with [X] mutations have a rapidly progressive disease , and early HSCT is indicated .

[Y] usually involves somatic and/or germline mutations in the genes of the RAS pathway , including PTPN11 , [X] , KRAS , NF1 , and CBL , in the leukemic cells .

The diagnosis of [Y] was confirmed by detection of spontaneous colony formation and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor hypersensitivity in vitro , and a somatic [X] point mutation .

Nf1 mutant mice with p19ARF gene loss develop accelerated hematopoietic disease Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a relentlessly progressive myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic -LRB- MPD/MDS -RRB- hematopoietic disorder more common in patients with any one of at least three distinct genetic lesions , specifically NF1 gene loss and PTPN11 and [X] mutations .

Prolonged suxamethonium [Y] should be anticipated in patients with recent history of organophosphate poisoning ; it is advisable to estimate the levels of [X] and avoid suxamethonium in patients with low enzyme levels .

Rarely , patients with [X] deficiency may show marked sensitivity to succinylcholine , manifested clinically by severely prolonged neuromuscular paralysis and [Y] .

We determined the BChE activity and the [X] genotype using molecular genetic methods , the duration of [Y] , time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used .

CONCLUSION : eleven of patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in [X] , indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of [Y] .

Inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes , including DAL-1 and various tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases , upregulation of several oncogenes including [X] and STAT3 , and signaling dysregulation of pathways such as the Wnt pathway , have each been found to play important , and perhaps , complementary roles in [Y] development , progression , and recurrence .

Our findings suggest that the combination of [X] and MDM2 polymorphisms enhance the risk of developing [Y] .

[X] mutations may be related to tumor invasiveness of human A combined polymerase chain reaction -LRB- PCR -RRB- with the enzyme HaeIII restriction analysis and DNA sequencing have been employed to study the mutations at codon of [X] gene in two human hepatocellular carcinoma -LRB- [Y] -RRB- cell lines and surgical specimens of [Y] .

beta-catenin and [X] mutations represent the two main genetic alterations described in [Y] , and [X] and KRAS mutations in CC , but rare genetic alterations could be particularly valuable if they constitute drug-able targets -LRB- such as PIK3CA or EGFR mutations -RRB- .

The diverse underlying causes of [Y] can be central defects , in which no functional arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- is released from the pituitary or can be a result of defects in the kidney -LRB- nephrogenic [Y] , NDI -RRB- .

Neurogenic [Y] occurs following injury to the magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus that produce and transport arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- and form the hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract .

Defects in [X] secretion and/or synthesis produce central diabetes insipidus -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , polyuria with polydipsia , hypernatremia and hyperosmolality .

[Y] became apparent immediately after the operation and was not controllable by arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- but by vasopressin -LRB- DDAVP -RRB- instead .

This finding suggests an association between [Y] and vasopressinase secretion from the placenta , because vasopressinase can degrade [X] but not DDAVP .

To determine whether the [Y] was of central or nephrogenic origin , we examined the responsiveness of the kidney to arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

An i.p. injection of [X] to LXRbeta -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice revealed a partial kidney response : There was no effect on urine volume , but there was a significant increase of urine osmolality , suggesting that [Y] may be caused by a defect in central production of [X] .

Glu-47 , which forms a salt bridge between neurophysin-II and arginine The arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene was sequenced in a pedigree with familial central diabetes insipidus -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Role of endogenous vasopressin in development of gastric ulcer induced by To elucidate the role of arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- in the development of stress-induced gastric ulcer , the mucosal lesions after restraint and water immersion were examined in Brattleboro strain rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and in Long-Evans rats -LRB- LE -RRB- used as controls .

Although subcutaneous injection of selective antidiuretic analogue did not affect UI , intracerebroventricular -LRB- icv -RRB- administration of [X] reduced UI in [Y] rats , and icv administration of V1 antagonist -LSB- d -LRB- CH2 -RRB- -LRB- Me -RRB- -RSB- [X] elevated UI in LE rats .

The hypothalamic [X] content in LE rats was unaffected by central HA infusion or restraint stress and was undetectable in [Y] rats .

Subjects were five male Brattleboro homozygous diabetes insipidus -LRB- [Y] -RRB- rats -LRB- + / - g -RRB- receiving chronic [X] replacement -LRB- microgram.kg-1 x day-1 -RRB- and seven Long-Evans -LRB- LE -RRB- normal rats -LRB- + / - g -RRB- .

Sequencing analysis of genes encoding AVP-neurophysin precursor or [X] receptor is expected to be a most useful method for the diagnosis of inherited [Y] .

Assessment of fluid status revealed that the patient had a reduced capacity for arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- secretion -LRB- partial [Y] -RRB- , which was not physiologically regulated and which was not concomitantly sufficient to produce maximally concentrated urine and allow the production of maximally diluted urine .

In the present study we examined the influence of arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- on conditioned freezing behavior to aversive shock treatment by comparing the responses of Brattleboro homozygous -LRB- [Y] -RRB- rats , Brattleboro heterozygous -LRB- HZ -RRB- rats , and Long-Evans -LRB- LE -RRB- rats .

They are : -LRB- -RRB- pituitary [Y] , due to inadequate production and secretion of antidiuretic hormone , arginine-vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- ; -LRB- -RRB- gestational [Y] due to degradation of [X] by an enzyme made in placenta ; -LRB- -RRB- primary polydipsia , due to suppression of [X] secretion by excessive fluid intake ; and -LRB- -RRB- nephrogenic [Y] due to renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of [X] .

Women without preexisting [Y] can also be affected by the actions of placental vasopressinase which increases in activity between the and weeks of gestation , leading to accelerated metabolism of [X] and causing a transient form of [Y] of pregnancy .

Management of [Y] of pregnancy depends on the pathophysiology of the disease ; forms of [Y] that lack [X] can be treated with desmopressin -LRB- DDAVP -RRB- , while forms of [Y] that involve resistance to [X] require evaluation of the underlying causes .

Diabetes insipidus in pregnancy may be due to relative reduction in secretion of [X] from the posterior pituitary -LRB- cranial [Y] -RRB- , increase in breakdown of [X] by placental cystine aminopeptidase with vasopressinase activity , or resistance of the rental tubules to [X] -LRB- nephrogenic [Y] -RRB- .

Diabetes insipidus -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a rare disorder of horses characterized by profound polyuria and polydipsia -LRB- PU/PD -RRB- , which can be caused by loss of production of arginine vasopressin -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

[Y] may also develop with absence or loss of [X] receptors or activity on the basolateral membrane of collecting-duct epithelial cells .

The transient nature of the central [Y] remains obscure but could be explained by a maturational delay in the tissues involved in [X] synthesis or release , during intrauterine life and infancy .

-LSB- Association study of renin-angiotensin system genes and hemostasis system genes The analysis of alleles and genotypes frequencies of SNP in genes of rennin-angiotensin system -LRB- REN , AGT , AGTR1 , AGTR2 , BKR2 , ADRB2 -RRB- and hemostasis system -LRB- FGB , [X] , F5 , F7 , ITGB3 , SERPINE1 , MTHFR -RRB- , as well as ACE insertion-deletion polymorphism in patients with [Y] comparing to healthy controls matched by age , sex and ethnicity has been carried out .

Nine of [X] rats suffered from macroscopically overt [Y] .

Similarly , reduced vasodilatory responses were present in aortae of [X] rats that had suffered a [Y] when compared with SHR or [X] rats resistant to [Y] .

The observed association and cosegregation of [Y] with significant and specific impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation among SHRSP and stroke-prone [X] hybrids , respectively , suggest a potential causal role of altered endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in the pathogenesis of [Y] .

So far , two genes responsible for [Y] have been identified : SLC3A1 -LRB- chromosome -RRB- encodes the heavy subunit rBAT of a renal b -LRB- , + -RRB- transporter while [X] -LRB- chromosome -RRB- encodes its interacting light subunit b -LRB- , + -RRB- AT .

Association between the [X] polymorphism and the occurrence of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a rare transmissible neurodegenerative disorder .

MM2-thalamic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease : neuropathological , biochemical and In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , molecular typing based on the size of the protease resistant core of the disease-associated prion protein -LRB- PrP -LRB- Sc -RRB- -RRB- and the M/V polymorphism at codon of the [X] gene correlates with the clinico-pathologic subtypes .

Here , we report a new pathogenic missense mutation -LRB- c. -LSB- > G -RSB- , p. -LSB- I215V -RSB- -RRB- in the [X] gene associated with three pathologically confirmed cases : two of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and one of Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- in two different families from the same geographical region in Spain .

This new mutation extends the list of known pathogenic mutations responsible for genetic [Y] , reinforces the clinical heterogeneity of the disease , and advocates for the inclusion of [X] gene examination in the diagnostic workup of patients with poorly classifiable dementia , even in the absence of family history .

In the overall meta-analysis of [Y] , SNPs were associated -LRB- P < -LRB- -RRB- ; two at [X] , three at ZBTB38-RASA2 , nine at nine other independent non-PRNP loci -RRB- , more than would be expected by chance .

Mutations in the coding region of the prion protein -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene are linked to inherited forms of TSEs whereas aetiology of sporadic [Y] -LRB- sCJD -RRB- remains obscure .

Genetic [Y] is caused by diverse mutations in the [X] gene .

Our aim is to identify specific genotype patterns and characteristics in the [X] genomic region and to understand susceptibility among Korean discriminated prion disease patients , suspected [Y] patients and the KARE data group .

We assessed the apolipoprotein E -LRB- ApoE -RRB- genotype in sporadic and ten familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients , in seven healthy siblings with a [X] mutation and in controls .

A Japanese case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with a point mutation in the prion We screened cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and healthy control subjects in Japan to detect possible polymorphisms in their prion protein gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

A new point mutation in the prion protein gene at codon in Creutzfeldt-Jakob We screened cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and healthy control subjects to detect possible polymorphisms in their prion protein gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

This new mutation occurs in a highly conserved part of the [X] coding sequence , close to the known CJD-associated codon mutation , and might be linked to a symptomatologic and neuropathologic pattern of typical sporadic [Y] .

The familial patients were members of the same pedigree where [Y] has been linked with a mutation at codon of the [X] gene .

In contrast , a recent case with proven P102L mutation of the [X] gene had rapidly developing dementia and severe cortical damage indistinguishable from the clinicopathological phenotype of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Repetitive octapeptide insertions of variable length in the [X] gene are also associated with spongiform encephalopathies , mostly familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

In both human and animals , genetic alterations to the gene encoding PrP -LRB- [X] in human -RRB- modulate susceptibility to [Y] .

Systematic [X] genotype analysis was performed on suspected [Y] cases referred to the National Surveillance Unit in the UK over the period .

A disease-associated mutation in the [X] gene was identified in nine -LRB- % -RRB- definite and probable cases of [Y] , a reliable estimate of the incidence of PRNP-related inherited [Y] based on a prospective epidemiological series .

Within the group of sporadic [Y] patients -LRB- lacking [X] mutations -RRB- , we confirmed that the genotype distribution with respect to the common methionine/valine -LRB- Met/Val -RRB- polymorphism at codon within [X] was significantly different from the normal Caucasian population .

A genetic analysis of the prion protein gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- showed overrepresentation of homozygosity for either methionine -LRB- M/M -RRB- or valine -LRB- V/V -RRB- at the polymorphic codon in [Y] patients as compared to controls .

Plaques or plaque-like PrPSc deposits were found in cases of [Y] and were associated with the presence of valine at codon on at least allele of [X] .

Pathogenic mutations in the human prion protein gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- have been identified in % of [Y] patients .

Following full remission of the FBDS , the patient manifested a rapidly progressive dementia associated with gross motor decline confirmed to be [Y] at autopsy -LRB- molecular subtype VV3 -RRB- , with no evidence of a pathogenic [X] mutation .

In our patient , mutation E200K and M129M polymorphism of the [X] gene and typical immunohistochemical findings pointed to a diagnosis of [Y] .

In humans , prion diseases can arise sporadically -LRB- sCJD -RRB- or genetically -LRB- gCJD and others -RRB- , caused by mutations in the PrP-gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- , or as a foodborne infection , with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- causing variant [Y] -LRB- vCJD -RRB- .

The first Chinese case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patient with R208H mutation A case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with a rare mutation of the prion protein -LRB- PrP -RRB- gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- at codon -LRB- R208H -RRB- , while the codon was a methionine homozygous genotype is reported .

Geographic accumulation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Slovakia -- environmental Slovakia is characterised by an unusually high number of patients affected by genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with E200K mutation at the [X] gene .

Genetic studies of over cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome -LRB- GSS -RRB- , fatal familial insomnia -LRB- FFI -RRB- and kuru have brought a reliable body of evidence that the familial forms of [Y] and all known cases of GSS and FFI are linked to germline mutations in the coding region of the [X] gene on chromosome , either point substitutions or expansion of the number of repeat units .

These findings suggest that glucocorticoid excess in the last trimester of rat pregnancy -LRB- i -RRB- is sufficient to programme offspring [Y] ; -LRB- ii -RRB- also increases basal plasma CORT levels , and -LRB- iii -RRB- permanently attenuates [X] and MR mRNA expression in specific hippocampal subfields .

However , [Y] in this model is unlikely to be mediated by similar changes in [X] or MR gene expression in the examined areas of the brain putatively involved in the more direct central regulation of blood pressure .

Hepatic Glucocorticoid Receptor Plays a Greater Role Than Adipose [X] in Metabolic Exogenous glucocorticoid administration results in hyperglycemia , insulin resistance , hepatic dyslipidemia , and [Y] , a constellation of findings known as Cushing 's syndrome .

The cases with [X] rearrangement were divided into [Y] , three DLBCL/BL , and six DLBCL .

Functional characterization of [X] receptor signaling deregulation in acute BACKGROUND : Molecular characterization of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor -LRB- [X] -RRB- in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- has recently been incorporated into clinical guidelines based on correlations between [X] internal tandem duplications -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- and decreased disease-free and overall survival .

Intracellular signaling responses were compared between healthy bone marrow myeloblasts -LRB- BMMb -RRB- and [Y] leukemic blasts characterized as [X] wild type -LRB- FLT3-WT -RRB- or FLT3-ITD .

Fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab chemotherapy followed by rituximab Recent results of treatment of early stage Hodgkin lymphoma : risk-adapted Molecular analysis of WT1 and KIT mutations in patients from an Indian population Mutations of the WT1 gene have been reported as the most common abnormality after NPM1 and [X] gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , while KIT mutations are predominantly found in core-binding factor -LRB- CBF -RRB- AMLs .

Stable disease for or more cycles was observed in solid tumor patients , and patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and [X] internal tandem duplication -LRB- FLT3ITD -RRB- experienced a decrease in bone marrow blasts to less than % .

We determined the incidence and prognostic relevance of NPM1 mutations , their association with [X] and IDH mutations , and other clinical characteristics in Serbian adult [Y] patients .

The lack of impact or unfavorable prognostic effect of NPM1 mutations found in this study can be assigned to a small cohort of analyzed [Y] patients , as can the presence of [X] and IDH mutations or other genetic lesions that cooperate with NPM1 mutations influencing prognosis .

VX-322 : a novel dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of In acute myelogenous leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , the [X] receptor tyrosine kinase -LRB- RTK -RRB- is highly expressed with % of patients expressing a mutated , constitutively active form of this protein .

Upon treatment of primary [Y] patient blast cells , the dual inhibition of [X] and c-KIT was superior to inhibitors targeting a single RTK .

MicroRNA-16 is down-regulated in mutated [X] expressing murine myeloid FDC-P1 Activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase [X] are one of the most frequent somatic mutations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Internal tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane region of [X] -LRB- FLT3/ITD -RRB- constitutively activate survival and proliferation pathways , and are associated with a poor prognosis in [Y] .

The clinicopathologic features and mutational status of KIT , [X] , NPM1 , CEBPA , and RAS were assessed in [Y] cases with isolated trisomy .

[X] -LRB- -RRB- and NPM1 -LRB- -RRB- mutations were observed at a frequency similar to normal-karyotype [Y] cases .

[X] and NPM1 mutations in a cohort of [Y] patients and detection of a novel Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an aggressive hematological disorder characterized by the loss of ability of the hematopoietic progenitor cells to differentiate and proliferate normally leading to an accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow .

Several novel molecular genetic aberrations in [X] and NPM1 have been shown to have a prognostic impact in [Y] , particularly in those having normal karyotype .

The present study screens a large cohort of non-acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- APL -RRB- [Y] patients -LRB- patients -RRB- for the presence of [X] and NPM1 mutations and further correlates with cytogenetics , immunophenotypic characteristics and with follow-up data wherever available .

Briefly , both [X] -LRB- internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- in % and tyrosine kinase domain -LRB- TKD -RRB- in % -RRB- and NPM1 mutations were detected in % of the total non-APL [Y] patients screened showing distinct correlations with hematologic , immunophenotypic , cytogenetics characteristics and follow-up .

Distinct prognostic subclasses of adult [Y] patients were identified based on the presence of NPM1 and [X] mutations .

Diversity of the juxtamembrane and TKD1 mutations -LRB- exons -RRB- in the [X] gene In acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- mutations in the juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domain -LRB- exons -RRB- of the [X] gene -LRB- FLT3-ITD/LM -RRB- are heterogeneous with respect to mutation load , size , and localization .

The aim of this study was therefore to establish a PTP expression profile in [Y] cells and to explore the possible role of [X] ITD -LRB- Fms-like tyrosine kinase with internal tandem duplication -RRB- , an important oncoprotein in [Y] for PTP gene expression .

Detection of internal tandem duplications in the [X] gene by different BACKGROUND : In acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , the internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- in the juxtamembrane domain of the [X] -LRB- Fms-like tyrosine kinase -RRB- gene is one of the most frequent genetic alterations associated with poor prognosis .

Discovery of the novel potent and selective [X] inhibitor - -LCB- - -LSB- - -LRB- - Structure-activity relationship -LRB- SAR -RRB- studies of - -LRB- quinazolin-4-ylthio -RRB- thiazole derivatives , which are for optimizing the in vitro and in vivo antiacute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- activity of a previously identified [X] inhibitor - -LRB- -RRB- thiazole -LRB- -RRB- , are described .

OBJECTIVE : To study the clinical significance of FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations including internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutation and point mutation of tyrosine kinase domain -LRB- TKD -RRB- in children with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Activating internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutations in [X] -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- are detected in approximately % of acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients and are associated with a poor prognosis .

Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 -LRB- quizartinib -RRB- , an active investigational inhibitor of [X] , KIT , PDGFRA , PDGFRB and RET ; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive [Y] patients with acquired resistance to AC220 .

Molecular and cellular effects of oncogene cooperation in a genetically accurate Biallelic CEBPA mutations and FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor -LRB- [X] -RRB- length mutations are frequently identified in human acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with normal cytogenetics .

BPR1J-097 , a novel [X] kinase inhibitor , exerts potent inhibitory activity BACKGROUND : Activating mutations of Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- constitute a major driver in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Hence , pharmacological inhibitors of [X] are of therapeutic interest for [Y] .

CI - This journal is -LRB- c -RRB- The Royal Society of Chemistry Overexpression of wild-type or mutants forms of CEBPA alter normal human CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha -LRB- C/EBPalpha/CEBPA -RRB- is mutated in approximately % of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- in both familial and sporadic [Y] and , with [X] and NPM1 , has received most attention as a predictive marker of outcome in patients with normal karyotype disease .

Acute myeloid leukemia and transcription factors : role of erythroid Kruppel-like We have investigated the role of erythroid transcription factors mRNA expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- in the context of cytogenetic and other prognostic molecular markers , such as FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , Nucleophosmin -LRB- NPM1 -RRB- , and CCAAT/enhance-binding protein alpha -LRB- CEBPA -RRB- mutations .

Further validation of Erythroid Kruppel-like Factor -LRB- EKLF -RRB- mRNA expression as a prognostic factor was assessed.We evaluated GATA binding protein -LRB- GATA1 -RRB- , GATA binding protein -LRB- GATA2 -RRB- , EKLF and Myeloproliferative Leukemia virus oncogen homology -LRB- cMPL -RRB- gene mRNA expression in the bone marrow of [Y] patients at diagnosis , and assessed any correlation with NPM1 , [X] and CEBPA mutations .

Breakdown of the FLT3-ITD/STAT5 axis and synergistic apoptosis induction by the Activating mutations of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase [X] are the most frequent molecular aberration in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Here , we show that RNA interference against [X] with an internal tandem duplication -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- potentiates the efficacy of the histone deacetylase inhibitor -LRB- HDACi -RRB- panobinostat -LRB- LBH589 -RRB- against [Y] cells expressing FLT3-ITD .

FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- normally functions in the survival/proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells , but its constitutive activation by internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutations correlates with a poor prognosis in [Y] .

Effect of small interfering RNA targeting wild-type [X] in acute myeloid This study investigated the effect of using small interfering RNA -LRB- siRNA -RRB- to silence the wild-type FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene in acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- cells , in vitro and in vivo .

[X] siRNA was introduced into the human [Y] cell line , THP1 , and into a THP1 xenograft tumour model in BALB/c nude mice .

These data suggest that [X] siRNA is a strong inhibitor of [X] expression in vitro and in vivo , and may provide a new therapeutic target for [Y] .

A key driver of [Y] is the FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Identification of the importance of FLT3-ITD and the [X] pathway in the prognosis of patients with [Y] has stimulated efforts to develop therapeutic inhibitors of [X] .

We conclude that multitargeted [X] inhibitors may have more utility earlier in the course of disease , when in vitro evidence suggests that [Y] cells are less dependent on [X] signaling , perhaps because of upregulation of multiple other signaling pathways .

Using combination therapy to override stromal-mediated chemoresistance in mutant Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- progenitors are frequently characterized by activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

We hypothesized that inhibition of protein kinases in addition to [X] may be effective in overriding drug resistance in [Y] .

In particular Janus kinase inhibitors were effective in overriding stromal protection and potentiating [X] inhibition in primary [Y] and cell lines .

The purpose of the study was to investigate by qRT-PCR the expression of miRNAs involved in myeloid differentiation -LRB- miR-424 , miR-155 , miR-223 , miR-17-5p -RRB- in patients with cytogenetically normal [Y] well characterized for NPM1 and/or [X] mutations .

In recent years , the development of more specific and potent agents has generated hope that [X] inhibitors may play a more prominent role in the treatment of FLT3-ITD [Y] in the near future .

Influence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication allele burden and white blood cell BACKGROUND : In patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , testing for fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- - internal tandem duplication -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- and nucleophosmin-1 -LRB- NPM1 -RRB- mutations can allow for further prognostic subclassification , but less is known about the effects of FLT3-ITD allele burden and presenting white blood cell count -LRB- WBC -RRB- within molecular subgroups .

In this work we show that ROS in the FLT3-ITD expressing [Y] cell line MV4-11 is reduced by treatment with PKC412 , an inhibitor of [X] , DPI , a flavoprotein inhibitor , and VAS2870 , a Nox specific inhibitor , suggesting that ROS production is both [X] and NADPH oxidase dependent .

Thus , we have shown that [X] driven H -LRB- -RRB- O -LRB- -RRB- production in [Y] cells is mediated by p22phox and is critical for STAT5 signalling .

We here report on the generation and preclinical characterization of an Fc-optimized antibody directed to the FMS-related tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , an antigen expressed on the leukemic blasts of all investigated patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

[X] expression levels on [Y] cells varied between and molecules/cell and , in most cases , were substantially higher than those detected on normal hematopoietic precursor cells and dendritic cells -LRB- approximately molecules/cell -RRB- .

OBJECTIVE : To explore the prevalence of IDH gene -LRB- IDH1 and IDH2 -RRB- mutations , types of mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , correlation with the internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutation of [X] gene , NPM1 gene mutation and some clinical characteristics .

Several genes have been identified in [Y] , such as [X] , KIT , NPM1 , and JAK2 .

Nonetheless , mutations in DNMT3A , TET2 , and ASXL1 are emerging as important adverse prognosticators in subsets of patients with [Y] independent of [X] mutations whereas mutations in IDH2 at residue are potential predictors of improved outcome in [Y] .

The best described of these are mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase , nucleophosmin , and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-alpha in those with cytogenetically [Y] , which allow more accurate risk stratification and help better ` target ' patients who may benefit from allogeneic transplantation -LRB- specifically those with activating [X] mutation -RRB- .

Selective [X] inhibition of FLT3-ITD + acute myeloid leukaemia resulting in Acquired resistance to selective [X] inhibitors is an emerging clinical problem in the treatment of FLT3-ITD -LRB- + -RRB- acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

We generated selective [X] inhibitor-resistant cells by treating the FLT3-ITD -LRB- + -RRB- human [Y] cell line MOLM-13 in vitro with the FLT3-selective inhibitor MLN518 , and validated the resistant phenotype in vivo and in vitro .

Our FLT3-Aurora kinase inhibitor , CCT137690 , successfully inhibited growth of FLT3-ITD-D835Y cells in vitro and in vivo , suggesting that dual FLT3-Aurora inhibition may overcome selective [X] inhibitor resistance , in part due to inhibition of Aurora kinase , and may benefit patients with FLT3-mutated [Y] .

Pacritinib -LRB- SB1518 -RRB- , a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of acute myeloid FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is the most commonly mutated gene found in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients and its activating mutations have been proven to be a negative prognostic marker for clinical outcome .

Pacritinib inhibits [X] phosphorylation and downstream STAT , MAPK and PI3 K signaling in FLT3-internal-tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- , FLT3-wt cells and primary [Y] blast cells .

Upregulation of JAK2 in FLT3-TKI-resistant [Y] cells was identified as a potential mechanism of resistance to selective [X] inhibition .

The FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Both compounds inhibit JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription -LRB- STAT -RRB- signaling in [Y] cells with JAK2 -LRB- V617F -RRB- mutations , but also diminish [X] signaling , particularly in FLT3-ITD -LRB- internal tandem duplication -RRB- cell lines .

In addition , several plasma cytokines/growth factors/chemokines triggered by the tumor growth were normalized , providing a rationale for combination therapy with an HDACi and a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of [Y] patients , particularly those with [X] or JAK2 mutations .

Internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- of the fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene is a gain-of-function mutation common in acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

This study demonstrates the feasibility and preliminary clinical activity of decitabine plus bortezomib in [Y] and identifies [X] as a novel pharmacodynamic end point for future trials .

Ponatinib may overcome resistance of FLT3-ITD harbouring additional point Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations are the most frequent mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- that confer a poor prognosis .

Fluvastatin inhibits [X] glycosylation in human and murine cells and prolongs [X] is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , but resistance has limited the benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors -LRB- TKI -RRB- .

[X] signaling and the development of inhibitors that target [X] kinase The FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- plays a key role in hematopoietic development and is frequently mutated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

SRC is a signaling mediator in FLT3-ITD Mutations of Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- are among the most frequently detected molecular abnormalities in [Y] patients .

Generation and characterization of a highly effective protein substrate for BACKGROUND : Gain-of-function mutations of tyrosine kinase [X] are frequently found in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

The protein was used to analyze tyrosine kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed [X] and crude cell extracts of bone marrow cells from [Y] patients .

Spontaneous , transient regression of B lymphoblastic leukemia in an adult Minimal residual disease monitoring based on [X] internal tandem duplication in [X] internal tandem duplication -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- is usually considered as a bad marker for minimal residual disease -LRB- MRD -RRB- follow-up in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

PATIENTS AND METHODS : We analyzed adults with primary [Y] , treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B first-line trials , who had pretreatment cytogenetics and , for cytogenetically normal patients , mutational status of NPM1 , CEBPA , and [X] available .

HSP90 inhibition had a stronger pro-apoptotic effect for [Y] cells with FLT3-ITD than for cells with wild-type [X] , whereas the anti-proliferative effect of HSP90 inhibition was similar for the two patient subsets .

The [X] and Pim kinases inhibitor SGI-1776 preferentially target FLT3-ITD [Y] A highly reduced cyanogen ligand derived from cyanide reductive coupling .

Moreover , the characterisation of specific molecular abnormalities provides the basis for targeted therapies , such as all trans retinoic acid -LRB- ATRA -RRB- and arsenic trioxide treatment in acute promyelocytic leukaemia or tyrosine kinase inhibitors in [Y] with [X] mutations .

Mutation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene occurs with a frequency of % in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Knock-in of a FLT3/ITD mutation cooperates with a NUP98-HOXD13 fusion to generate Constitutive activation of [X] by internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- is one of the most common molecular alterations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

FMS-like tyrosine kinase internal tandem duplication and the patterns of its CONTEXT : Constitutive activation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- receptor tyrosine kinase by internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- has been researched in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Reversal of [X] mutational status and sustained expression of NPM1 mutation in We report a case of de novo acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with unstable [X] gene mutations and stable NPM1 mutation .

Mutations in fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene including internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- and point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain -LRB- TKD -RRB- as well as in nucleoplasmin -LRB- NPM1 -RRB- gene are associated with pathogenesis of acute myeloblastic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Several reports have demonstrated high incidences of the [X] and NPM1 mutations in adult [Y] patients .

Since the pathogenesis of pediatric [Y] is different from that of adult and the [X] and NPM1 mutations have not been well characterized in childhood [Y] .

Therefore , the objective of this study was to determine the frequencies of [X] and NPM1 mutations in newly diagnosed childhood [Y] patients .

The [Y] M3 cell type was most frequently associated with [X] gene mutations -LRB- % -RRB- .

In conclusion , the [X] mutations was found in % but none of NPM1 mutation was detected in Thai children with [Y] .

In addition , [Y] with erythroid predominance had a lower frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities as well as a lower frequency of mutations involving NPM1 , NRAS and [X] as compared with [Y] without erythroid predominance .

[X] is expressed at high levels in % of cases of [Y] and in virtually all cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia .

This study addressed the role of DEP-1 for regulation of the acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- - related mutant [X] internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- protein .

In intact cells , including primary [Y] cells , [X] ITD kinase inhibition reactivated DEP-1 .

Multivariate analyses showed that detection of abnormal SNP lesions by SNP-A karyotyping results in an unfavorable prognostic value for overall survival -LRB- hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , ; % CI , to ; P = -RRB- ; other significant prognostic factors included secondary [Y] -LRB- HR , ; % CI , to ; P = -RRB- , presence of the [X] mutation -LRB- HR , ; % CI , to ; P < -RRB- , and age -LRB- HR , ; % CI , to ; P = -RRB- .

The role of [X] kinase as an [Y] therapy target .

A constitutively activated , mutated form of [X] , is expressed in approximately % of de novo acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and about % of acute lymphoblastic leukemia -LRB- ALL -RRB- cases .

However , although many aspects of the intracellular signaling mediated by oncogenic [X] have been revealed , what is the best strategy to inhibit [X] and how [X] inhibitors should be developed for [Y] treatment is poorly defined .

Despite promising in vitro studies , where most [X] inhibitors show potent efficacy at nanomolar concentrations , clinical responses in [Y] patients are moderate and temporary .

On the other hand , given that overexpression of [X] ligand -LRB- FL -RRB- , occurring after myelosuppressive therapy , reduces the efficacy of [X] inhibitors , targeting both FL and [X] kinase , might be more effective approach in [Y] treatment .

[X] mutation status is a predictor of early death in pediatric acute BACKGROUND : [X] mutations -LRB- FLT3/Mut -RRB- are prevalent in de novo [Y] and are associated with early relapse .

Patient-specific analysis of [X] internal tandem duplications for the OBJECTIVES : Internal tandem duplications -LRB- ITDs -RRB- of the fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene occur in % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Impact of [X] internal tandem duplication on the outcome of related and PURPOSE : Patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and FLT3/internal tandem duplication -LRB- FLT3/ITD -RRB- have poor prognosis if treated with chemotherapy only .

Phase IB study of the [X] kinase inhibitor midostaurin with chemotherapy in This phase trial investigated several doses and schedules of midostaurin in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high-dose cytarabine post-remission therapy in newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

These data show that [X] RNA and protein are aberrantly expressed by [Y] and ALL cells in that CD34 expression and [X] expression are no longer synchronous , and suggest the possibility that overexpression of [X] could play a role in the survival and/or proliferation of malignant clones in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias .

In the present study , cases of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- were examined by flow cytometry for cell surface expression of [X] and KIT receptors .

Among [Y] cases tested , expressed [X] receptor and expressed KIT receptor , without any correlation with FAB subtype .

FL and KL stimulated the proliferation of leukemic blasts in [Y] cases -LRB- including five [X] or KIT receptor-negative cases -RRB- , with an additive effect when added simultaneously .

Finally , [X] is expressed on leukemic blasts of acute myeloid leukemias -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and acute lymphoid leukemias -LRB- ALL -RRB- of the B lineage , providing a possible application in diagnosis and therapy of these diseases .

[X] receptor surface expression was found predominantly in pre-B cell , myeloid and monocytic cell lines and in pre-B-ALL and [Y] cells , FL was overexpressed in baby hamster kidney cells producing a recombinant protein that was functional in receptor binding and signaling .

In this review , we evaluate the FLT3-ITD mutation and discuss the recent data regarding emerging approaches using [X] inhibitors for the treatment of [Y] .

All-trans retinoic acid synergizes with [X] inhibition to eliminate FLT3/ITD + FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- - mutant acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- portends a poor prognosis , and ineffective targeting of the leukemic stem cell -LRB- LSC -RRB- population remains one of several obstacles in treating this disease .

[X] tyrosine kinase inhibitors -LRB- TKIs -RRB- used as monotherapy also achieve limited clinical responses and are thus far unable to affect cure rates in [Y] patients .

These studies provide evidence of the potential of this drug combination to eliminate FLT3/ITD -LRB- + -RRB- LSCs and reduce the rate of relapse in [Y] patients with [X] mutations .

Moreover , acquisition of secondary [X] TKD mutations , mainly at D835 -LRB- D835F/H/V / Y -RRB- , are recognized as the major mechanisms of resistance of [Y] patients with FLT3-ITD to sorafenib .

The improved clinical outcomes seen in patients achieving sustained [X] inhibition encourage continued evaluation of FLT3-directed therapy alongside front-line [Y] treatment .

MZH29 is a novel potent inhibitor that overcomes drug resistance [X] mutations More than one-third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- harbor aberrant mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Palbociclib treatment of FLT3-ITD + [Y] cells uncovers a kinase-dependent Up to % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia have constitutively activating internal tandem duplications -LRB- ITDs -RRB- of the [X] receptor tyrosine kinase .

Co-expression of wild-type [X] attenuates the inhibitory effect of [X] [X] mutation is found in about % of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients and is associated with a poor prognosis .

Although most [Y] cells harboring [X] mutation co-express wild-type -LRB- Wt -RRB- - [X] , it is not fully understood how Wt-FLT3 expression is associated with the resistance to [X] inhibitors .

It was also confirmed that FL impaired the anti-leukemia effects of [X] inhibitors on primary [Y] cells .

Targeted sequencing efforts have identified several mutations with diagnostic and prognostic values in KIT , NPM1 , CEBPA and [X] in both adult and paediatric [Y] .

Enhanced glucocorticoid sensitivity was only seen in [Y] patient samples that were negative for the [X] mutation -LRB- P = -RRB- .

Patients who had TP53-mutated [Y] had significantly lower incidence of mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , rat sarcoma -LRB- RAS -RRB- , and nucleophosmin -LRB- NPM1 -RRB- and higher incidence of coexisting MPL mutations compared with those who had wild type TP53 .

The mechanism of action study illustrates that pteridin-7 -LRB- -RRB- - one derivatives suppress the phosphorylation of [X] and its downstream pathways , thereby inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in [Y] cells .

Overall , we provide a structurally distinct chemical scaffold with which to develop [X] mutants-selective inhibitors for [Y] treatment .

Does [X] mutation impact survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation BACKGROUND : Patients with FMS like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- - mutated acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- have a poor prognosis and are referred for early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation -LRB- HCT -RRB- .

METHODS : Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research -LRB- CIBMTR -RRB- were used to evaluate adult patients with de novo [Y] who underwent HCT during through to determine whether [X] mutations had an impact on HCT outcomes .

Targeting FLT3-ITD signaling mediates ceramide-dependent mitophagy and attenuates Signaling pathways regulated by mutant Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- - internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- , which mediate resistance to acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- cell death , are poorly understood .

FLT3-ITD + [Y] drug resistance is attenuated by LCL-461 , a mitochondria-targeted ceramide analog drug , in vivo , which also induced lethal mitophagy in human [Y] blasts with clinically relevant [X] mutations .

Despite high initial remission rates , prognosis remains poor for most [Y] patients , especially for those harboring internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutations in the fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

The IC50 values for NT1721 were significantly lower than those for clinically used [Y] drugs -LRB- i.e. cytarabine , sorafenib -RRB- in all tested [Y] cell lines regardless of their [X] mutation status .

Frequency of [X] -LRB- ITD , D835 -RRB- Gene Mutations in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia : a BACKGROUND : [X] is mutated in about of acute myelogenous leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients .

The aim of the present study was to report the prevalence of [X] mutations and comparison with prognostic factors in [Y] patients in the Northeastern of Iran .

Out of [Y] patients , -LRB- % -RRB- had [X] mutation , -LRB- with [X] - ITD , % , and with FLT3-D825 , % -RRB- .

The prevalence of [X] heterozygous mutations is more that homozygous mutations in [Y] patients .

We amplified the [X] gene at exon and in [Y] patients -LRB- aged between months and years -RRB- from referral centers -LRB- a university hospital and regional hospitals in Northeast Thailand -RRB- , using a simple PCR method .

The new and recurrent [X] juxtamembrane deletion mutation shows a dominant In acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , the Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is one of the most frequently mutated genes .

The analysis of the clonal structure in these cases suggests that the mutation order in the NUP98-rearranged pediatric [Y] begins with the NUP98 rearrangement leading to epigenetic dysregulations then followed by mutations of critical hematopoietic transcription factors and finally , activation of the [X] signaling pathway.Leukemia advance online publication , November ; doi :10.1038 / leu .

Although there is no evidence that [Y] pathophysiology is related to hypoxia , leukemic blasts still show several distinct biological features when exposed to reduced pO2 : they down - or upregulate membrane receptors such as CXCR4 or [X] , activate or inhibit intracellular signaling pathways such as PI3K , and specifically secrete cytokines -LRB- IL-8 -RRB- .

Dual inhibition of AKT/FLT3-ITD by A674563 overcomes [X] ligand-induced drug The FLT3-ITD mutation is one of the most prevalent oncogenic mutations in [Y] .

One of the resistance mechanisms in the [Y] refractory patients involves FLT3-ligand induced reactivation of AKT and/or ERK signaling via [X] wt kinase .

Our findings suggest that A674563 might be a potential drug candidate for overcoming [X] ligand-mediated drug resistance in FLT3-ITD positive [Y] .

Activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase [X] comprise approximately one-third of genetic lesions in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and are associated with a poor prognosis .

Although [X] tyrosine kinase inhibitors -LRB- TKIs -RRB- appear to improve clinical outcomes for patients with FLT3-ITD [Y] , the development of early-generation [X] TKIs has been impeded by several obstacles such as low potency and selectivity , myelosuppression , and the emergence of resistance-conferring point mutations .

Eradication of Acute Myeloid Leukemia with [X] Ligand-Targeted miR-150 Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a common and fatal form of hematopoietic malignancy .

Overexpression and/or mutations of [X] have been shown to occur in the majority of cases of [Y] .

Our analysis of a large-scale [Y] patient cohort -LRB- N = -RRB- indicates that [X] is particularly highly expressed in some subtypes of [Y] , such as [Y] with t -LRB- -RRB- / MLL-rearrangements or FLT3-ITD .

To treat FLT3-overexpressing [Y] , we developed a novel targeted nanoparticle system : [X] ligand -LRB- FLT3L -RRB- - conjugated G7 poly -LRB- amidoamine -RRB- -LRB- PAMAM -RRB- nanosized dendriplex encapsulating miR-150 , a pivotal tumor suppressor and negative regulator of [X] We show that the FLT3L-guided miR-150 nanoparticles selectively and efficiently target FLT3-overexpressing [Y] cells and significantly inhibit viability/growth and promote apoptosis of the [Y] cells .

AZD1208 sensitized primary [Y] cells with FLT3-ITD to topoisomerase inhibitors , but did not sensitize [Y] cells with wild-type [X] or remission bone marrow cells , supporting a favorable therapeutic index .

The discoveryof additional mutations in genes such as NPM1 , CEBPA and [X] , which are frequent in [Y] patients with a normal karyotype , have improved the precision of risk stratification in [Y] .

Activation of protein phosphatase in [X] + acute myeloid leukemia cells Constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , via co-expression of its ligand or by genetic mutation , is common in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Thus combining a PP2A activating compound and a [X] inhibitor may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating [Y] .

Internal Tandem Duplication in [X] Attenuates Proliferation and Regulates Internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutations in the Fms-related tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- are associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a frequently mutated oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Collectively , our data suggest that SLAP2 acts as a negative regulator of [X] signaling and therefore , modulation of SLAP2 expression levels may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for FLT3-ITD positive [Y] .

ATM/G6PD-driven redox metabolism promotes [X] inhibitor resistance in acute Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- are common in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and drive leukemic cell growth and survival .

To identify genetic targets that can sensitize [Y] cells to killing by [X] inhibitors , we performed a genome-wide RNA interference -LRB- RNAi -RRB- - based screen that identified ATM -LRB- ataxia telangiectasia mutated -RRB- as being synthetic lethal with [X] inhibitor therapy .

The use of an agent that intensifies mitochondrial oxidative stress in combination with a [X] inhibitor augmented elimination of [Y] cells in vitro and in vivo , revealing a therapeutic strategy for the improved treatment of [X] mutated [Y] .

These findings suggest potential benefit of post-HCT sorafenib in FLT3-ITD [Y] , and support further evaluation of post-HCT [X] inhibition .

Prevalence and Clinical Significance of [X] Mutation Status in Acute Myeloid BACKGROUND AND AIMS : FLT3-ITD mutations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- are associated with a poor prognosis .

PG - AB - Homeobox -LRB- HOX -RRB- proteins and the receptor tyrosine kinase [X] are frequently highly expressed and mutated in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Here , we demonstrate that the histone modifiers MLL1 and DOT1L control HOX and [X] expression and differentiation in NPM1mut [Y] .

SIGNIFICANCE : MLL1 and DOT1L are chromatin regulators that control HOX , MEIS1 , and [X] expression and are therapeutic targets in NPM1mut [Y] .

Bone marrow biopsy was diagnosed with [Y] , not otherwise specified , with mutations of [X] and IDH2 -LRB- R140Q -RRB- .

FGF2 from Marrow Microenvironment Promotes Resistance to [X] Inhibitors in Acute Potent [X] inhibitors , such as quizartinib -LRB- AC220 -RRB- , have shown promise in treating acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- containing [X] internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutations .

Subcellular localization of the FLT3-ITD oncogene plays a significant role in the Internal tandem duplication of the juxtamembrane domain of FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- receptor is the most prevalent [X] mutation accounting for % of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients .

Patients with [X] mutated [Y] have poor prognosis because of resistance to induction chemotherapy or early relapse .

High fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- receptor surface expression predicts poor BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES : Mutations in fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- receptor have significant role in assessing outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

The objective of the current study was to investigate adult patients with [Y] for [X] expression and [X] ITD mutation , and their association with long-term outcome .

INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS : This study evaluated [X] ITD mutation along with [X] expression in [Y] patients , and associated with survival .

Negative impact of [X] surface expression on survival was observed in [Y] patients who were [X] ITD negative .

DOCK2 interacts with [X] and modulates the survival of FLT3-expressing leukemia The FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene is the most commonly mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , and patients carrying internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutations have a poor prognosis .

We show that DOCK2 is expressed in leukemia cell lines and primary [Y] samples , and DOCK2 co-immunoprecipitates with wild-type [X] and FLT3/ITD .

These findings suggest that DOCK2 is a potential therapeutic target for novel [Y] treatments , as this protein regulates the survival of leukemia cells with elevated [X] activity and sensitizes FLT3/ITD leukemic cells to conventional antileukemic agents.Leukemia advance online publication , November ; doi :10.1038 / leu .

Interestingly , we observed FLT3-ITD [Y] cells are more sensitive to PI3KD/V-IN than the [X] wt expressing cells .

Whereas adding the rather unspecific tyrosinekinase inhibitor sorafenib to standard treatment in unselected [Y] patients has not improved overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- , the addition of midostaurin to standard therapy in the selected group [X] mutated patients has resulted in a moderate but significant OS benefit.Real world data show that in patients below years a cure rate of ca. % can be achieved .

Outcome of FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia : impact of allogeneic stem BACKGROUND : Activating mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase [X] -LRB- fms-related tyrosine kinase -RRB- reflect the most frequent molecular aberration in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Prognostic significance of the [X] ITD mutation in patients with BACKGROUND : Fms-like tyrosine kinase internal tandem duplication -LRB- [X] ITD -RRB- mutation is related to poor prognosis in normal-karyotype acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

We investigated the prognostic significance of the [X] ITD mutation at relapse in normal-karyotype [Y] patients .

METHODS : We analyzed normal-karyotype [Y] patients , in whom paired bone marrow samples taken at initial diagnosis and subsequent relapse were analyzed for the [X] ITD mutation at the Asan Medical Center between and .

These results suggest that , in normal-karyotype [Y] patients with relapse , the prognostic significance of [X] ITD mutation at relapse is greater than that of the mutation status at diagnosis .

Even though t -LRB- ; -RRB- - [Y] is less likely to co-occur with FLT3-ITD in pediatric patients , this report suggests that prognostic factors , including [X] and KIT genes and the surface marker CD56 , should be analyzed in these patients .

Similarly , acute depletion of DEP-1 in the human [Y] cell line THP-1 caused elevated [X] phosphorylation .

Acute promyelocytic leukaemia -LRB- APL -RRB- with t -LRB- ; -RRB- ; PML-RARalpha -LRB- n = ; % -RRB- harboured the highest frequency of [X] mutations , followed by myelomonocytic -LRB- n = ; % -RRB- and [Y] with t -LRB- ; -RRB- ; RUNX1-RUNX1T1 -LRB- n = ; % -RRB- .

Similarly , [X] expression levels did not influence survival in [Y] in both the good risk and non-good risk subgroups .

Therapeutic targets using [X] inhibitors may not be useful in AMKL and in young children with [Y] .

PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Ever since the recognition that FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations exert a profound negative prognostic impact on the clinical outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , researchers have sought to find effective small-molecule inhibitors of this receptor tyrosine kinase .

SUMMARY : Clinical trials have so far demonstrated that inhibitors of [X] do have clinical activity in patients with FLT3-mutant [Y] , although this activity is often transient and correlates with effective in-vivo suppression of the [X] target .

Patients with t-AML were older -LRB- P < -RRB- and they had lower white blood counts -LRB- P = -RRB- compared with de novo [Y] patients ; t-AML patients had abnormal cytogenetics more frequently , with overrepresentation of translocations as well as adverse cytogenetics , including complex and monosomal karyotypes , and with underrepresentation of intermediate-risk karyotypes -LRB- P < -RRB- ; t-AML patients had NPM1 mutations -LRB- P < -RRB- and [X] internal tandem duplications -LRB- P = -RRB- less frequently .

Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- are found in approximately % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

However , the molecular mechanisms by which [X] mutations lead to cell transformation in [Y] remain unclear .

We identified over tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about proteins in both [Y] -LRB- wild type and mutant [X] -RRB- and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia -LRB- normal and amplification of [X] -RRB- cell lines .

Concurrent mutations in NPM1 , [X] , CEBPA , and NRAS were detected only in [Y] with the IDH1 -LRB- R -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- mutation .

[X] mutation -LRB- P < -RRB- was associated with progression to acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , as were a higher bone marrow -LRB- BM -RRB- blast count -LRB- P < -RRB- and complex cytogenetics -LRB- P = -RRB- .

We conclude that [X] and NPM1 mutations are rare in MDS , but assessment of mutation status is potentially useful for predicting progression to [Y] .

Flt3-ITD alters chemotherapy response in vitro and in vivo in a p53-dependent OBJECTIVE : The [X] internal tandem duplication -LRB- Flt3-ITD -RRB- confers a worse prognosis for patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- ; however , the mechanisms involved are unknown .

-LSB- Sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy in the induction therapy for FLT3-ITD OBJECTIVE : To explore the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of [X] positive acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , to highlight the impact of [X] mutations and targeting therapy on response of [Y] .

Fms like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- and nucleophosmin -LRB- NPM1 -RRB- mutations in de novo Mutations in [X] and NPM1 are important prognostic factors in [Y] , influencing outcome in normal karyotype cases .

The incidence of [X] and NPM1 mutations was found to be low in Indian patients with normal karyotype [Y] .

They demonstrate that a high LSC score is associated with poor prognosis in [Y] patients and further demonstrate that the score is independent of known prognostic factors , including age , karyotype and mutation of the [X] or NPM1 genes .

Furthermore , inhibition of [X] kinase results in downregulation of mTOR signaling associated with decreased survival of FLT3-mutated [Y] cells .

These findings suggest that mTOR signaling operates downstream of activated [X] kinase thus contributing to tumor cell survival , and may represent a promising therapeutic target for [Y] patients with mutated-FLT3 .

Another missense mutation was identified in SHKBP1 , which acts downstream of [X] , a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in about % of [Y] cases .

Sorafenib , an inhibitor of multiple kinases including [X] , has shown promising activity in FLT3-ITD-positive [Y] .

One such gene is the Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene , which is mutated in approximately % of adult patients with [Y] and has a significant impact on prognosis .

In particular , internal tandem duplications in [X] confer a poor prognosis to this large subgroup of patients with [Y] .

Agents that target [X] are in development for the treatment of patients who have [Y] and offer a potential paradigm change in the current standard treatment of [Y] .

For this report , the authors reviewed the prognostic significance of genetic alterations observed in [Y] with a focus on the therapeutic implications of targeting [X] .

Stromal niche cells protect early leukemic FLT3-ITD + progenitor cells against Targeting constitutively activated FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LSB- -LRB- [X] -RRB- ; FLT3-ITD -RSB- with tyrosine kinase inhibitor -LRB- TKI -RRB- in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- leads to clearance of blasts in the periphery but not in the bone marrow , suggesting a protective effect of the marrow niche on leukemic stem cells .

In this study , we examined the effect of stromal niche cells on CD34 -LRB- + -RRB- progenitors from patients with FLT3-ITD -LRB- + -RRB- or wild-type [X] -LRB- FLT3-WT -RRB- [Y] treated with the TKIs SU5614 or sorafenib .

Role of allogeneic transplantation for FLT3/ITD acute myeloid leukemia : outcomes Acute myelogenous leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients with FLT3/ITD mutations have an inferior survival compared to [Y] patients with wild-type -LRB- WT -RRB- [X] , primarily because of an increased relapse rate .

Reduced-intensity cord blood transplantation without prior remission induction [X] / ITD regulates leukaemia cell adhesion through alpha4beta1 integrin and Pyk2 Internal tandem duplication of FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase -LRB- FLT3/ITD -RRB- within its juxtamembrane domain is a frequent mutation in adult acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

These results collectively indicated that the inhibition of [X] kinase might contribute not only to the induction of apoptosis , but also to the leukaemia cell detachment from the bone marrow microenvironment in the treatment of [Y] .

RESULTS : We demonstrated [X] protein expression -LRB- > % -RRB- in % of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , % of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia -LRB- B-ALL -RRB- , % of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia -LRB- T-ALL -RRB- and % of biphenotypic leukemia .

When correlated with disease status , all patients in the relapsed [Y] group had [X] > % at diagnosis .

Unlike [Y] , the relapsed group of B-ALL showed a lower incidence of [X] than the remission group .

CONCLUSION : In summary , our data imply that there is frequent overexpression of the [X] protein in [Y] and B-ALL patients of Indian origin .

Mutations of [X] have been reported in about a third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , and inhibitors of [X] are of clinical interest .

Importantly , SGI-1776 was also cytotoxic in [Y] primary cells , irrespective of [X] mutation status and resulted in Mcl-1 protein decline .

Combined effects of [X] and NF-kappaB selective inhibitors on acute myeloid FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an independent poor prognostic marker of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , and strategies that specifically target [X] are therefore of substantial interest .

However , previous studies with [X] inhibitors as single agents in patients with [Y] showed few clinical responses .

In the present study , combined effects of [X] selective inhibitor -LRB- SC-203048 -RRB- and NF-kappaB selective inhibitor -LRB- Parthenolide , PTL -RRB- on [Y] xenograft tumor growth in vivo were examined , and the possible antitumor mechanisms by which SC-203048 and PTL affect [Y] xenograft tumor growth were also detected .

Relapsed [Y] defined molecularly by mutant nucleophosmin-1 without concurrent fms-related tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- internal tandem duplication seems to benefit most from GO .

These mutations result in constitutive activation of [X] , and [X] inhibitors are currently undergoing trials in [Y] patients selected on [X] molecular status .

p53 activation of mesenchymal stromal cells partially abrogates Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- [X] -RRB- inhibitors have been used to overcome the dismal prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with [X] mutations .

We investigated the role of p53 in bone marrow stromal cells in stromal cell-mediated resistance to [X] inhibition in [X] mutant [Y] .

While the [X] inhibitor FI-700 induced apoptosis in [X] mutant [Y] cells , apoptosis induction was diminished under stromal coculture conditions .

With the help of molecular modeling , this class was rapidly optimized for both potency against [X] and FLT3/c-KIT and excellent potency in cell-based assays , leading to dose-dependent cell death in acute myelogenous leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patient blast samples .

Ultimately , the [Y] patient blast data defined the preferred target profile as we designed and evaluated a set of [X] selective and FLT3/c-KIT dual molecules .

Prognostic value of [X] mutations among different cytogenetic subgroups in acute BACKGROUND : The impact of FMS-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations and mutation burden among cytogenetic subgroups of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- other than normal karyotype -LRB- NK -RRB- [Y] is unclear .

RESULTS : In total , patients were included : % had , CBF-AML , % had NK-AML , and % had poor risk [Y] , and the frequency of any [X] mutations was % , % , and % in the respective cytogenetic subgroups .

[X] mutation did not have an impact on event-free survival -LRB- EFS -RRB- in patients with CBF-AML -LRB- P = -RRB- and poor-risk [Y] -LRB- P = -RRB- .

CONCLUSIONS : [X] mutations did not have a prognostic impact in patients with [Y] who had good-risk and poor-risk karyotypes .

Concomitant ABCG2 overexpression and FLT3-ITD mutation identify a subset of acute BACKGROUND : ABCG2 protein overexpression and [X] internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- correlate with higher relapse rate and shorter disease-free survival -LRB- DFS -RRB- in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , but no data are available on the possible effect of concomitant presence of these factors .

Major clinical responses in [Y] patients receiving single-agent [X] inhibitors have been rare , although transient peripheral blood blast reduction is common .

Given such biological suggestion and preclinical activity , [X] inhibitors hold promise in improving the outcome of patients with mutant [X] [Y] .

This review summarizes the current attempts to target this molecule , with emphasis on the validity of the target , the results of the clinical trials evaluating the [X] inhibitors in [Y] , the optimal use of these compounds and the mechanisms of resistance .

Genotyping of intron rearrangements of [X] by inverse-shifting PCR in [Y] A -LRB- HA -RRB- is the most common severe bleeding disorder in humans , affecting one in male births .

In order to do so , coding regions in five candidate genes -LRB- MGMT , AXIN2 , CTNNB1 , TGFBR1 and [X] -RRB- were sequenced in unrelated microsatellite-stable hereditary non-polyposis CRC -LRB- MSS [Y] -RRB- cases .

Molecular , biological , and clinical data indicate that [Y] is initiated before birth when fetal liver haematopoietic cells trisomic for chromosome acquire mutations in [X] .

[Y] usually resolves spontaneously by months ; however % subsequently develop ML-DS harbouring the same [X] mutation -LRB- s -RRB- .

Acquired mutations in the transcription factor-encoding [X] gene are observed in nearly all individuals with DS who are born with transient myeloproliferative disorder -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , a clonal preleukemia , and/or who develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia -LRB- AMKL -RRB- .

[X] mutations in a cohort of Malaysian children with Down syndrome-associated INTRODUCTION : Children with Down syndrome -LRB- DS -RRB- are at increased risk of developing distinctive clonal myeloid disorders , including transient abnormal myelopoiesis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and myeloid leukaemia of DS -LRB- ML-DS -RRB- .

METHODS : We herein report , to our knowledge , the first observation on the frequency and nature of [X] gene mutations in a cohort of Malaysian children with DS-associated [Y] -LRB- n = -RRB- and ML-DS -LRB- n = -RRB- encountered successively over a period of five years at a national referral centre .

RESULTS : Of the patients who underwent [X] analysis , [X] mutations were observed in -LRB- % -RRB- patients , including -LRB- % -RRB- out of patients with [Y] , and -LRB- % -RRB- of patients with ML-DS .

[Y] and ML-DS are caused by co-operation between trisomy , which itself perturbs fetal haematopoiesis and acquired mutations in the key haematopoietic transcription factor gene [X] .

METHODS : [X] gene was screened in DNA samples from neonates presenting with [Y] during their leukemic and remission status .

CONCLUSIONS : [Y] should be considered in case of congenital leukemia with megakaryoblastic features and accompanied by trisomy and [X] mutation .

CONCLUSIONS : V89L polymorphism of the [X] gene is a strong determinant of [Y] risk among children of Indian origin .

An intronic deletion leading to skipping of exon of [X] in a boy with mild A mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta was diagnosed in a boy with short stature , [Y] , blueish sclerae , dentinogenesis imperfecta , hyperextensible joints and bruisable skin .

The current study aimed to investigate the association between an insertion/deletion -LRB- INS/DEL -RRB- polymorphism in the ` untranslated region -LRB- ` UTR -RRB- of [X] and the risk of developing [Y] .

Furthermore , the levels of [X] and let7g were measured in the primary osteoblasts obtained from patients with [Y] .

[Y] is due to mutations involving several genes , the most commonly involved are the [X] or COL1A2 genes which are responsible for the synthesis of the proalpha-1 and proalpha-2 polypeptide chains that form the type I collagen triple helix .

[Y] type V has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and is not caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes [X] and COL1A2 .

A previously undiagnosed [Y] was confirmed by genetic analysis -LRB- [X] gene mutation -RRB- .

Osteogenesis imperfecta type I : second-trimester diagnosis and incidental OBJECTIVE : To present second-trimester ultrasound and molecular diagnosis for osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- type I in a female fetus and incidental identification of a dominant [X] deletion mutation in her paucisymptomatic father .

-LSB- Studies of type I collagen -LRB- [X] -RRB- alpha1 chain in patients with osteogenesis Nucleotide sequences of exon , adjacent intron areas , and regulatory region of the alpha1 chain of type I collagen -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene were analyzed in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- from families and their relatives residing at Bashkortostan Republic -LRB- BR -RRB- .

Six mutations -LRB- four nonsense mutations c. > T -LRB- p.Gly323X -RRB- , c. > T -LRB- p.Arg361X -RRB- , c. > T -LRB- p.Arg415X -RRB- , and c. > T -LRB- p.Gln957X -RRB- -RRB- in patients of the Russian origin and two mutations with open reading frame shift c. -LRB- p.Gly194ValfsX71 -RRB- , and c. -LRB- p.Gly815AlafsX293 -RRB- -RRB- in patients with [Y] of Tatar ethnicity as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms in the [X] gene were revealed .

A novel splicing mutation in [X] gene caused type I osteogenesis imperfecta in Osteogenesis imperfect -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a heritable connective tissue disorder with bone fragility as a cardinal manifestation , accompanied by short stature , dentinogenesis imperfecta , hyperlaxity of ligaments and skin , blue sclerae and hearing loss .

Here we identified a novel splicing mutation c. +1 G > A -LRB- GenBank ID : JQ236861 -RRB- in the [X] gene that caused type I [Y] in a Chinese family .

In-hospital death while awaiting cardioverter/defibrillator in neuromuscular Hyperglycemia in patients with hypertensive crisis : response to `` Hypertensive Osteogenesis Imperfecta : the audiological phenotype lacks correlation with the BACKGROUND : Osteogenesis Imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a heritable connective tissue disorder mainly caused by mutations in the genes [X] and COL1A2 and is associated with hearing loss in approximately half of the cases .

METHODS : With the purpose of evaluating inter - and intrafamilial variability , hearing was thorougly examined in [Y] patients -LRB- type I : ; type III : ; type IV : -RRB- , aged years , with a mutation in either [X] or COL1A2 and originating from different families .

In the subsample of [Y] subjects , no association was found between the nature of the mutation in [X] or COL1A2 genes and the occurrence , type or severity of hearing loss .

Initially , the autosomal dominant forms of [Y] , caused by mutations in either [X] or COL1A2 , were described .

Furthermore , in the past years , it has become clear that [Y] comprises a group of heterogeneous disorders , with an estimated % of cases due to a causative variant in the [X] or COL1A2 genes and with the remaining % due to causative recessive variants in the genes known so far , or in other currently unknown genes .

The disease segregated with [X] in [Y] type I families , and with COL1A2 in one [Y] type IV family .

[X] and COL1A2 haplotype frequencies were compared in normal and [Y] chromosomes : no preferential association of the disease with a given haplotype was detected .

We preformed linkage analyses in eight [Y] type III families using RFLPs associated with the [X] and COL1A2 loci to determine whether mutations in the genes for type I collagen were responsible for this form of [Y] .

Since dominant [Y] can be due to mutations at either of two loci -LRB- [X] and COL1A2 -RRB- prenatal diagnosis becomes feasible in the majority of the affected families only if a very informative marker is available for both of these genes .

Paternal mosaicism for a [X] dominant mutation -LRB- alpha Ser-415 -RRB- causes We describe a dominant point mutation in the [X] gene causing extremely severe osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] type II/III -RRB- which was detected in the dermal fibroblasts of a proband , diagnosed by ultrasonography at weeks of gestation .

Our data suggest that nonsense and frameshift mutations throughout most of the [X] gene result in a null allele , which is associated with the predictable mild clinical phenotype , [Y] type .

To determine the frequency of such mutations in [Y] type I cell strains , we used PCR amplified genomic DNA in conjunction with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis -LRB- DGGE -RRB- and SSCP , to screen the ' untranslated domain , exon , and a small portion of intron of the [X] gene .

These data suggest that mutations in the [X] promoter do not play a significant role in the aetiology of [Y] type I .

Nuclear retention of [X] messenger RNA identifies null alleles causing mild Osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility .

Most cases of severe [Y] result from mutations in the coding region of the [X] or COL1A2 genes yielding an abnormal collagen alpha chain .

Using reverse transcriptase-PCR and single-strand conformational polymorphism of [X] mRNA from patients with mild [Y] , we describe three patients with distinct null producing mutations identified from the mutant transcript within the nuclear compartment .

Defining the distribution of allelic variants of [X] mRNA in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments gives further insight into cell biology of [Y] and provides a strategy for investigating potential causes of a null allele .

Some phenotype correlations , notably between the [Y] type IV phenotype and linkage to COL1A2 and between presenile hearing loss in [Y] type I and linkage to [X] , can be used to improve risk estimates substantially in families where there are no segregation data to distinguish whether [X] or COL1A2 is the mutant locus .

Dermal fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of type I collagen , suggesting that the [Y] type I phenotype results from a variety of mutations which alter the apparent expression of either [X] or COL1A2 , the genes encoding the chains of type I collagen .

These data suggest that most of our [Y] I families have [X] mutations .

Mutations in the COL1A2 gene of type I collagen that result in nonlethal forms of Although virtually all mutations that result in osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- affect the genes that encode the chains of type I procollagen , the effects of mutations in the COL1A2 gene have received less attention than those in the [X] gene .

Mutation analysis of coding sequences for type I procollagen in individuals with Mutations in one of the two genes encoding type I procollagen -LRB- [X] and COL1A2 -RRB- are frequently the cause of osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , a disorder characterized by brittle bones .

Defective splicing of mRNA from one [X] allele of type I collagen in Osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- type I is the mildest form of heritable bone fragility resulting from mutations within the [X] gene .

Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal propeptide of the pro alpha -LRB- I -RRB- chain of type Fibroblast cell strains from three infants with perinatal lethal osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- carry unique mutations in [X] -LRB- the gene encoding the pro alpha -LRB- I -RRB- chain of type I procollagen -RRB- that impair chain association .

The mildest form of [Y] , Osteogenesis Imperfecta type I , is frequently caused by haploinsufficiency mutations in [X] , the gene encoding the alpha1 -LRB- I -RRB- chain of type collagen .

Here , we report an infant with severe [Y] born following a twin pregnancy in whom the bone disease is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic mutation , c. > T , p. -LRB- Ala1387Val -RRB- located in the C-propeptide region of [X] .

Targeted [X] screening of additional patients detected three further heterozygous variants -LRB- p.Arg253 * , p.Gly767Ser and p.Gly154Val -RRB- in three distinct subjects : two of them diagnosed with early onset glaucoma and mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , one patient with a diagnosis of PCG at age years .

CONCLUSIONS : Dominant inherited mutations in [X] are known causes of connective tissues disorders such as [Y] .

Our results expand the role of [X] mutations in different forms of early-onset glaucoma with and without signs of [Y] .

Thus , we suggest including [X] mutation screening in the genetic work-up of glaucoma cases and detailed ophthalmic examinations with fundus analysis in patients with [Y] .

Here , we report a typical case of [Y] IIC caused by a novel heterozygous mutation in the C-propeptide region of [X] .

The majority of [Y] cases are caused by mutations in [X] or COL1A2 .

% of patients with [Y] carry a variant in the type collagen genes , [X] and COL1A2 , which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance .

-LSB- Analysis of type IV osteogenesis imperfecta caused by two mutations occurred OBJECTIVE : To detect potential mutations of [X] and COL1A2 genes with polymerase chain reaction-high-resolution melting analysis -LRB- PCR-HRMA -RRB- in a proband diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

It has been known for three decades that the majority of individuals with [Y] have mutations in [X] or COL1A2 , the two genes coding for collagen type I alpha chains , but in the past years defects in at least other genes have been linked to [Y] .

Mutation analysis of the [X] and COL1A2 genes in Vietnamese patients with BACKGROUND : The genetics of osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- have not been studied in a Vietnamese population before .

We performed mutational analysis of the [X] and COL1A2 genes in unrelated [Y] patients of Vietnamese origin .

-LSB- Analysis of [X] gene mutation in an ethnic Han Chinese family from Henan OBJECTIVE : To identify potential mutation of [X] gene in an ethnic Han Chinese family from Henan affected with osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

CONCLUSION : The [Y] type of this family may have been autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance or autosomal recessive associated with [X] gene mutations .

Clinical characteristics and the identification of novel mutations of [X] and Osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by brittle bone fractures .

The aim of the present study was to investigate the pathogenic gene mutation spectrum and clinical manifestations of mutations in collagen type I , alpha -LRB- [X] -RRB- and collagen type I , alpha -LRB- COL1A2 -RRB- genes in Chinese patients with [Y] .

A total of unrelated Chinese [Y] patients with [X] and COL1A2 mutations were recruited .

The mutations p.Gly257Arg , p.Gly767Ser and p.Gly821Ser in [X] and p.Gly337Ser in COL1A2 may be located at a mutation hotspot for human [Y] due to the high repetition rate in [Y] patients .

These findings may improve understanding of the pathogenic gene mutation spectrum and the clinical manifestations of mutations of [X] and COL1A2 genes in Chinese patients with [Y] .

[X] and COL1A2 were sequenced and [Y] causing mutations identified -LRB- in [X] , in COL1A2 -RRB- .

Osteogenesis imperfecta caused by PPIB mutation with severe phenotype and Osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an inherited disorder of connective tissue typically caused by defects in either [X] or COL1A2 .

There appears to be a trend toward rhizomelic shortening and less severe bowing of the extremities , as compared to patients with comparably severe [Y] caused by [X] or COL1A2 mutation .

INTRODUCTION : [Y] is usually caused by mutations in [X] or COL1A2 , the genes encoding collagen type I alpha chains , but mutations in at least other genes have also been associated with [Y] .

All mutations found in [Y] type I were dominant and exclusively affected [X] or COL1A2 .

Eight mutations including novel ones in the [X] gene in Czech patients with BACKGROUND AND AIM : Osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , also called brittle bone disease , is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased bone density .

The aim of this study was to identify mutations and allelic variants of the [X] gene in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

METHODS AND RESULTS : Molecular genetic analysis of the [X] gene was performed in a cohort of patients with [Y] .

Tooth agenesis in osteogenesis imperfecta related to mutations in the collagen BACKGROUND : Osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a heterogeneous group of disorders of connective tissue , mainly caused by mutations in the collagen type I genes -LRB- [X] and COL1A2 -RRB- .

With the discovery of [X] and COL1A2 gene variants as a cause of [Y] , sequence analysis of these genes was added to the diagnostic process .

About % of individuals with [Y] are heterozygous for causative variants in the [X] and COL1A2 genes .

A novel DHPLC-based procedure for the analysis of [X] and COL1A2 mutations in Approximately % of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- exhibit dominant [X] or COL1A2 mutations ; however , molecular analysis is difficult because these genes span and exons , respectively .

We devised a PCR-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography -LRB- DHPLC -RRB- procedure to analyze the [X] or COL1A2 coding regions and validated it using DNA samples from individuals without [Y] , DNA samples from two cells to investigate the procedure 's potential for preimplantation diagnosis , and DNA samples from patients with [Y] .

DHPLC revealed six novel mutations , three of which were intronic , in all patients with [Y] , and these results were confirmed by means of [X] and COL1A2 direct sequencing .

The pathology report of the aborted foetus indicated [Y] , and DNA analysis confirmed a [X] mutation .

The patients have mild [Y] caused by mutations in [X] -LRB- Patient : p.Asp1219Asn -RRB- or COL1A2 -LRB- Patient : p.Ala1119Thr -RRB- , respectively .

Heterozygous C-propeptide mutations in [X] : osteogenesis imperfecta type IIC Osteogenesis imperfecta type IIC -LRB- [Y] IIC -RRB- is a rare variant of lethal [Y] that has been considered to be an autosomal recessive trait .

One case with [Y] IIC and the sibs had novel heterozygous mutations in the C-propeptide region of [X] , while the second patient with clear-cut [Y] IIC had no mutation in this region .

The proalpha1 -LRB- I -RRB- and proalpha2 -LRB- I -RRB- chains of collagen are encoded by the [X] and COL1A2 genes , respectively ; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of [Y] or some sub-types of EDS .

The majority of patients -LRB- about % -RRB- with a clinical diagnosis of [Y] have a mutation in the [X] or COL1A2 genes , which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance .

[Y] is caused by mutations in the genes encoding for collagen type I [X] and COL1A2 , respectively .

The identification of novel mutations in [X] , COL1A2 , and LEPRE1 genes in Dominant inheritance of osteogenesis imperfecta -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is caused by mutations in [X] or COL1A2 , the genes that encode type I collagen , and CRTAP , LEPRE1 , PPIB , FKBP10 , SERPINH1 , and SP7 mutations were recently detected in a minority of patients with autosomal recessive [Y] .

In this study , mutation analyses were performed for [X] , COL1A2 , CRTAP , and LEPRE1 in a cohort of unrelated Chinese patients with [Y] ; the relationship between collagen type I mutations and clinical features was examined .

The Brtl / + mouse is a heterozygous model for [Y] which contains a Gly349Cys substitution in one [X] allele , and demonstrates a low ductility phenotype .

[Y] IIC seems to be caused by a dominant mutation of [X] .

We describe two cases with a phenotypic overlap between [Y] and RSS who both have [X] mutations .

CONCLUSIONS : Our results combined with the two previous studies suggest that direct sequencing of TMEM127 should be considered , after a negative screening of VHL , [X] , SDHB , and SDHD genes , in patients with [Y] .

Germline mutations in the [X] , SDHA , SDHAF2 , SDHB , SDHC , SDHD , MAX , TMEM127 , NF1 or VHL genes are identified in about % of patients with [Y] or paraganglioma and somatic mutations in [X] , VHL or MAX genes are reported in % of sporadic tumors .

Patients with [X] D631Y mutations most commonly present with [Y] and Multiple endocrine neoplasia type results from an activating germline mutation in the [X] proto-oncogene .

Carriers of a [X] mutation are at risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma , [Y] , and primary hyperparathyroidism .

We present a family with the rare [X] mutation , D631Y in which the proband initially presented with a [Y] , and review the available literature pertaining to this mutation .

Patients with a D631Y [X] mutation typically present with [Y] and medullary thyroid carcinoma appears to occur with a later onset than reported with other [X] mutations .

Prevalence of germline mutations in patients with [Y] or abdominal BACKGROUND : Germline mutations in the susceptibility genes [X] , SDHB , SDHD , and VHL have been reported in % of patients with [Y] -LRB- Pheo -RRB- or paraganglioma -LRB- PGL -RRB- and sporadic presentation .

Bilateral adrenal [Y] with a germline L790F mutation in the [X] About ten percent of [Y] are associated with familial syndrome .

Bilateral adrenal [Y] with a germline L790F mutation in the [X] About ten percent of [Y] are associated with familial syndrome .

This group is composed of the entities of multiple endocrine neoplasia type -LRB- MEN2 -RRB- due to mutations in the [X] gene , von Hippel-Lindau disease -LRB- VHL , VHL gene -RRB- , the paraganglioma syndromes types -LRB- PGL1-4 -RRB- due to mutations of the genes SDHD , SDHAF2 , SDHC , SDHB , neurofibromatosis type -LRB- NF1 -RRB- due to mutations of the NF1 gene and familial [Y] syndromes due to mutations of the SDHA , TMEM127 and MAX genes .

Transcriptome studies indeed revealed that [Y] and paragangliomas can be classified into two major clusters depending on their gene expression profile : Cluster comprises samples associated with a hypoxic signature such as SDHx - and VHL-related tumors and cluster includes [X] , NF1 , and TMEM127-mutated tumors , as well as most of sporadic tumors .

[X] , a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase and a receptor for the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands , was one of the first oncogenes to be identified , and has been shown to be an oncogene in thyroid cancer and [Y] .

A new germline VHL gene mutation in three patients with apparently sporadic CONTEXT : Germline mutations in four genes -LRB- [X] , VHL , SDHB and SDHD -RRB- are detected in about % of patients with apparently sporadic [Y] .

DESIGN AND PATIENTS : All the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of [X] , VHL , SDHB and SDHD genes were sequenced in three unrelated patients with intra-adrenal [Y] : a girl , a boy and a man .

Most familial cases of [Y] and/or paraganglioma and % sporadic cases carry germline mutations in VHL , [X] , NF1 , SDHA , SDHB , SDHC , SDHD , SDHAF2 , TMEM127 , or MAX .

The finding of somatic mutations in VHL and [X] in an additional % of tumors has brought the proportion of all patients with [Y] and/or PGL due to a genetic disruption in these genes to approximately one half .

In this short review article , we comment on our previous report of a large multiple endocrine neoplasia type kindred with the same Cys609Ser germline [X] mutation in which , conversely , the syndrome was characterized by a slightly aggressive , highly penetrant form of medullary thyroid carcinoma that was associated with low penetrance of [Y] and primary hyperparathyroidism .

The DNA segment encompasses the [X] proto-oncogene , a receptor tyrosine kinase gene expressed in MTC and [Y] and at lower levels in normal human thyroid .

Risk of [Y] in affected patients depends on the position of [X] mutation .

Extensive mutation scanning of [X] in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma and of Sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- MTC -RRB- and [Y] -LRB- PC -RRB- have been reported to be associated with some specific [X] gene mutations .

[X] transcripts were detected in all of sporadic and one familial [Y] .

The levels of [X] mRNA were higher in of [Y] than in the normal adrenal medulla , indicating that [X] is overexpressed in the majority of sporadic [Y] .

There was a considerable difference in the level of [X] expression in each [Y] ranging from to times the transcripts found in the normal adrenal medulla .

The sizes of the transcripts of , , , and kb were the same as those found in the adrenal medulla , suggesting no rearrangements of the [X] gene in [Y] .

Missense germline mutations of the [X] proto-oncogene have recently been identified in the hereditary cancer syndromes MEN2A , MEN2B , and FMTC , all characterized by medullary carcinoma , but also including [Y] in MEN2A and MEN2B and parathyroid disease in MEN2A .

Mutations in the cysteine-rich region of the [X] proto-oncogene in patients Medullary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- MTC -RRB- and [Y] appear in either a sporadic or a hereditary form as components of multiple endocrine neoplasia -LRB- MEN -RRB- .

This region encompasses the [X] proto-oncogene , a receptor tyrosine kinase gene expressed in medullary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- MTC -RRB- and [Y] .

-LSB- Percutaneous catheter drainage of an unusually extensive tuberculous hypostatic -LSB- Detection of RET-proto-oncogene mutations in the diagnosis of Type endocrine We have analyzed blood - and paraffin-derived DNA samples of individuals from Switzerland -LRB- MEN family members and patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma or [Y] -RRB- for the presence of [X] protooncogene mutations in exons , , , and , where recently germline point mutations have been identified in more than % of patients with MEN , familial medullary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- FMTC -RRB- and MEN .

DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded specimens of neuroendocrine tumors was screened for somatic [X] point mutations in exons , , , , and , where recently oncogenic mutations have been described in a subset of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas and [Y] .

Although the numbers of each investigated neuroendocrine tumor type are small , our data indicate that oncogenic [X] proto-oncogene mutations are involved in the formation of a subset of sporadically occurring medullary thyroid carcinomas and [Y] but do not appear to be generally important in the formation of other types of sporadically occurring neuroendocrine tumors .

The [X] proto-oncogene in sporadic [Y] .

In order to evaluate the role of [X] proto-oncogene in the development and growth of [Y] , we examined mutations in [X] and expression of [X] in cases of sporadic [Y] .

On the other hand , [X] mRNA was detected in all [Y] and the levels of [X] expression were higher in of [Y] than in normal adrenal medulla , indicating that [X] is overexpressed in a sizable portion of sporadic [Y] .

These results suggest that high levels of expression of [X] may have relevance to the development or growth of sporadic [Y] .

Sixteen different point mutations in the [X] proto-oncogene and mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau -LRB- VHL -RRB- tumor suppressor gene have been identified so far associated with expression of [Y] .

We retrospectively analyzed patients with MEN , with associated [Y] , regarding the relevance of specific mutations in the [X] proto-oncogene and the diagnostic sensitivity of catecholamine screening and localization procedures .

The present study shows that the position of the [X] mutation is related to disease phenotype ; codon mutations are predictive of families predisposed to [Y] .

Therefore , mutation analysis of the [X] gene should be performed in apparently `` sporadic '' cases of [Y] to confirm or exclude MEN .

We conclude that , in all families with MEN , mutational analysis of the [X] proto-oncogene should be performed , both to identify gene carriers for MEN and to identify specific mutations that are more strongly associated with [Y] .

Although mutations at codon -LRB- GAG -- > GAC ; Glu -- > Asp -RRB- of the [X] proto-oncogene were recently reported to be found in % of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas -LRB- MTCs -RRB- , the absence of missense mutations at codon was confirmed both with PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism -LRB- RFLP -RRB- and PCR-SSCP analysis in all examined cases of [Y] .

These results suggest that mutations at codon of the [X] proto-oncogene do not represent a frequent mechanism of tumorigenesis for both sporadic and hereditary [Y] .

In this study , we have transfected NIH3T3 and PC12 [Y] cells with MEN2A -LRB- Cys634 - > Arg -RRB- and MEN2B -LRB- Met918 - > Thr -RRB- [X] constructs .

To investigate the genetic basis for familial [Y] alone , we screened three affected kindreds for mutations in the [X] proto-oncogene and the VHL tumour suppressor gene .

Patients with familial , multiple , or early onset [Y] should be investigated for germline VHL and [X] gene mutations as the molecular diagnosis of multisystem familial cancer syndromes enables appropriate counselling and screening to be provided .

Proceedings of the annual meeting of the Cardiopulmonary Bypass Consensus -LSB- The molecular pathology of [X] protooncogene in families with multiple endocrine BACKGROUND : Multiple endocrine neoplasm type -LRB- MEN -RRB- is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma , [Y] and hyperparathyroidism .

A rare missense variant in [X] exon in a Portuguese family with atypical BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type -LRB- MEN2 -RRB- is a rare genetic disorder characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- MTC -RRB- , [Y] and primary hyperparathyroidism .

Distinct mutations across hotspot [X] exons can cause Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type -LRB- MEN2A -RRB- characterised by development of medullary thyroid cancer -LRB- MTC -RRB- , [Y] -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and primary hyperparathyroidism -LRB- PHPT -RRB- , with a strong correlation between genotype and phenotype .

Distinct mutations across hotspot [X] exons can cause Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type -LRB- MEN2A -RRB- characterised by development of medullary thyroid cancer -LRB- MTC -RRB- , [Y] -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and primary hyperparathyroidism -LRB- PHPT -RRB- , with a strong correlation between genotype and phenotype .

We generated induced pluripotent stem cells -LRB- iPSCs -RRB- from a patient with [X] mutation at codon who developed [Y] and MTC .

A walk in the park : Is Pokemon Go foreshadowing the future of biodiversity The communications gap between scientists and public : More scientists and their M918V [X] mutation causes familial medullary thyroid carcinoma : study of Germline mutations in codon of exon of the [X] gene -LRB- M918T -RRB- are classically associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type -LRB- MEN -RRB- with highly aggressive medullary thyroid cancer -LRB- MTC -RRB- , [Y] and a unique phenotype .

Studies of human [Y] identified two additional novel transcripts involving the skipping of exon or exons , , and and are referred to as [X] -LRB- Delta -RRB- -LRB- E3 -RRB- and [X] -LRB- Delta -RRB- -LRB- E345 -RRB- , respectively .

Integrative genomic analysis reveals somatic mutations in [Y] and [Y] and paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that occur in the context of inherited cancer syndromes in approximately % of cases and are linked to germline mutations in the VHL , [X] , NF1 , SDHA , SDHB , SDHC , SDHD , SDHAF2 and TMEM127 genes .

In the case of MEN , gain-of-function germline mutations clustered in specific codons of the [X] proto-oncogene increase the risk of developing medullary thyroid carcinoma -LRB- MTC -RRB- , [Y] and parathyroid tumours .

Moreover , we report the first case of [Y] among the [X] p.G533C-carriers in this Brazilian family and explore the [X] mutational status in DNA isolated from [Y] .

Finally , we described two novel [X] variants -LRB- G548V and S556T -RRB- in the DNA isolated from [Y] while they were absent in the DNA isolated from blood .

METHODS : We describe the work-up , diagnosis , and treatment course of a patient who presented with multi-focal [Y] , parathyroid adenoma , thyroid abnormalities , and a [X] mutation .

RESULTS : A man with previously treated [Y] presented with a parathyroid adenoma , multiple thyroid nodules , and a [X] polymorphism .

[Y] and paraganglioma can occur as a part of genetic syndromes - familial paragangliomas -LRB- SDH genes , SDHAF2 gene -RRB- , von Hippel-Lindau syndrome -LRB- VHL gene -RRB- , multiple endocrine neoplasia type -LRB- [X] gene -RRB- , and neurofibromatosis type -LRB- NF1 gene -RRB- .

Expression of the [X] proto-oncogene in normal human tissues , [Y] , In order to evaluate the roles of the [X] proto-oncogene in normal human tissues and tumors derived from the neural crest cells , we examined the expression of [X] in a variety of adult human tissues , [Y] , medullary thyroid carcinomas -LRB- MTCs -RRB- , ganglioneuromas , and a neurinoma .

These results suggest that [X] may play some roles in a limited range of adult human tissues , and that its high levels of expression may have relevance to development or growth of [Y] and MTCs .

To elucidate the etiological roles in tumorigenesis of sporadic MTCs and [Y] , mutations in the cysteine-rich region of the [X] proto-oncogene were analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism -LRB- PCR-SSCP -RRB- analysis .

Diagnosis and management of [Y] in patients with multiple endocrine It has been suggested that specific mutations in the [X] proto-oncogene correlate with clinical manifestation of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type -LRB- MEN -RRB- syndrome .

Absence of mutations at codon of the [X] proto-oncogene in sporadic and Sixteen sporadic [Y] , [Y] in neurofibromatosis , and [Y] in multiple endocrine neoplasia -LRB- MEN -RRB- or were screened for mutations at codon of the [X] proto-oncogene by AluI digestion of polymerase chain reaction PCR products and mutations in exon by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism -LRB- SSCP -RRB- analysis .

Integrative genomic analysis reveals somatic mutations in [Y] and [Y] and paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that occur in the context of inherited cancer syndromes in approximately % of cases and are linked to germline mutations in the VHL , [X] , NF1 , SDHA , SDHB , SDHC , SDHD , SDHAF2 and TMEM127 genes .

In their large study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , Shen and colleagues have dissected the overlapping incidences and prognostic significances of mutations of the genes most frequently mutated in [Y] , including FLT3 , [X] , CEBPA , KIT , N-RAS , MLL , WT1 , IDH1/2 , TET2 , DNMT3A , and ASXL1 .

Whole-exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of BCOR in acute myeloid Among acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients with a normal karyotype -LRB- CN-AML -RRB- , [X] and CEBPA mutations define World Health Organization provisional entities accounting for approximately % of patients , but the remaining % are molecularly poorly characterized .

Prognostic impact of [X] mutations in Serbian adult patients with acute myeloid Based on current findings , the presence of [X] mutations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients is associated with an increased probability of complete remission -LRB- CR -RRB- and better overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- .

We determined the incidence and prognostic relevance of [X] mutations , their association with FLT3 and IDH mutations , and other clinical characteristics in Serbian adult [Y] patients .

The lack of impact or unfavorable prognostic effect of [X] mutations found in this study can be assigned to a small cohort of analyzed [Y] patients , as can the presence of FLT3 and IDH mutations or other genetic lesions that cooperate with [X] mutations influencing prognosis .

The clinicopathologic features and mutational status of KIT , FLT3 , [X] , CEBPA , and RAS were assessed in [Y] cases with isolated trisomy .

FLT3 -LRB- -RRB- and [X] -LRB- -RRB- mutations were observed at a frequency similar to normal-karyotype [Y] cases .

FLT3 and [X] mutations in a cohort of [Y] patients and detection of a novel Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is an aggressive hematological disorder characterized by the loss of ability of the hematopoietic progenitor cells to differentiate and proliferate normally leading to an accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow .

Several novel molecular genetic aberrations in FLT3 and [X] have been shown to have a prognostic impact in [Y] , particularly in those having normal karyotype .

The present study screens a large cohort of non-acute promyelocytic leukemia -LRB- APL -RRB- [Y] patients -LRB- patients -RRB- for the presence of FLT3 and [X] mutations and further correlates with cytogenetics , immunophenotypic characteristics and with follow-up data wherever available .

Briefly , both FLT3 -LRB- internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- in % and tyrosine kinase domain -LRB- TKD -RRB- in % -RRB- and [X] mutations were detected in % of the total non-APL [Y] patients screened showing distinct correlations with hematologic , immunophenotypic , cytogenetics characteristics and follow-up .

Distinct prognostic subclasses of adult [Y] patients were identified based on the presence of [X] and FLT3 mutations .

[X] is the most frequently mutated gene in [Y] and the role of the [X] mutant in acute myeloid leukemia along with its leukemogenic potential are still under investigation.NPM1 genetic alterations can contribute to leukemogenesis through the direct oncogenic effect of the mutant protein and the concomitant loss of one functional allele .

This work was designed to study the prevalence and nature of [X] gene mutations in a group of Egyptian patients with [Y] to get an idea about the profile of [X] gene mutations in our society .

CONCLUSION : Two novel [X] gene mutations were detected among our study population of [Y] patients identified as : the insertion CACG associated with point mutation , deletion of one base , or associated with point mutation .

[X] gene mutations may become a new tool for monitoring minimal residual disease in [Y] with normal karyotype .

CI - This journal is -LRB- c -RRB- The Royal Society of Chemistry Overexpression of wild-type or mutants forms of CEBPA alter normal human CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha -LRB- C/EBPalpha/CEBPA -RRB- is mutated in approximately % of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- in both familial and sporadic [Y] and , with FLT3 and [X] , has received most attention as a predictive marker of outcome in patients with normal karyotype disease .

Acute myeloid leukemia and transcription factors : role of erythroid Kruppel-like We have investigated the role of erythroid transcription factors mRNA expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- in the context of cytogenetic and other prognostic molecular markers , such as FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase -LRB- FLT3 -RRB- , Nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- , and CCAAT/enhance-binding protein alpha -LRB- CEBPA -RRB- mutations .

Further validation of Erythroid Kruppel-like Factor -LRB- EKLF -RRB- mRNA expression as a prognostic factor was assessed.We evaluated GATA binding protein -LRB- GATA1 -RRB- , GATA binding protein -LRB- GATA2 -RRB- , EKLF and Myeloproliferative Leukemia virus oncogen homology -LRB- cMPL -RRB- gene mRNA expression in the bone marrow of [Y] patients at diagnosis , and assessed any correlation with [X] , FLT3 and CEBPA mutations .

In conclusion , we have validated EKLF mRNA expression as an independent predictor of outcome in [Y] , and its expression is not associated with FLT3-ITD and [X] mutations .

miR-10a is aberrantly overexpressed in Nucleophosmin1 mutated acute myeloid BACKGROUND : Acute myeloid leukaemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with nucleophosmin-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutation is a major subtype of [Y] .

The [X] mutation induces a myeloproliferative disorder , but evidence indicates that other insults are necessary for the development of [Y] .

We utilised microRNA microarrays and functional assays to determine if microRNA dysregulation could be involved in the pathogenesis of in [X] mutated -LRB- NPM1mut -RRB- - [Y] .

A panel of five microRNAs dichotomised [Y] patients according to their [X] mutational status .

Incidental finding of small `` lipoma-like '' tumor during hepatic lobectomy for CD123 immunohistochemical expression in acute myeloid leukemia is associated with FLT3-ITD and [X] mutation testing in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- plays an important role in prognostic risk stratification , especially within the intermediate cytogenetic risk group .

Prior flow cytometric studies have suggested an association between CD123 overexpression in [Y] and FLT3-ITD and/or [X] mutations ; however , the immunohistochemical -LRB- IHC -RRB- correlate is unknown .

We assessed CD123 IHC expression in [Y] bone marrow biopsies and/or marrow particle preparations , and correlated with the morphologic , immunophenotypic , and cytogenetic features and with the presence of FLT3-ITD and [X] mutations .

Eighty-three percent -LRB- -RRB- FLT3-ITD-mutated [Y] were CD123 + -LRB- P < -RRB- and % -LRB- -RRB- NPM1-mutated cases were CD123 IHC + -LRB- P = -RRB- with negative predictive values of % for FLT3-ITD and % for [X] .

Potent graft-versus-leukemia effect after reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT for To investigate the role of reduced-intensity allogeneic -LRB- RIC-allo -RRB- stem cell transplant -LRB- SCT -RRB- as postremission therapy in adult intermediate-risk patients with acute myelogenous leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with FLT3-ITD or wild-type [X] and CEBPA without FLT3-ITD , we conducted a single-center retrospective study between January and December .

We addressed the combined consequences of promoter hypermethylation of p15 , CDH1 , ER , MDR1 , and RARB2 and mutation of [X] , CEBPA , FLT3 , and WT1 in a Danish cohort of pediatric and adult [Y] patients .

Compared to adult [Y] we found a significant difference in p15 -LRB- % vs. % , P < -RRB- and RARB2 -LRB- % vs. % , P = -RRB- methylation , as well as in [X] -LRB- % vs. % , P = -RRB- and FLT3ITD -LRB- % vs. % , P < -RRB- mutation .

In of patients with del -LRB- -RRB- [Y] , either a deletion involving the centromeric and/or telomeric regions or heterozygous mutations in [X] or MAML1 located in were present .

The most frequent genetic change currently known in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is the mutation of the nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene .

Aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of [X] protein -LRB- NPMc + -RRB- is the result of this mutation , and it can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry for the identification of a favorable subgroup within `` [Y] with normal karyotype '' according to the World Health Organization classification .

[X] staining pattern was defined in [Y] and control cases by the use of bone marrow smears in order to overcome limitations observed due to immunohistochemistry .

Bone marrow smears are well applicable and therefore a real alternative for the determination of [X] with the highest accuracy for optimal risk stratification in [Y] .

After adjusting for well-studied prognostic factors , IDH1 mutation seems to be associated with subtle but significantly inferior event-free survival -LRB- EFS -RRB- -LRB- p = -RRB- and possible adverse overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- -LRB- p = -RRB- in patients with [Y] , especially in the favorable genotype subset with mutated [X] but without FLT3-ITD mutation -LRB- p < -RRB- .

The purpose of the study was to investigate by qRT-PCR the expression of miRNAs involved in myeloid differentiation -LRB- miR-424 , miR-155 , miR-223 , miR-17-5p -RRB- in patients with cytogenetically normal [Y] well characterized for [X] and/or FLT3 mutations .

We aimed to study the frequency and relationship of a wide range of genes previously reported as mutated in [Y] -LRB- ASXL1 , [X] , FLT3 , TET2 , IDH1/2 , RUNX1 , DNMT3A , NRAS , JAK2 , WT1 , CBL , SF3B1 , TP53 , KRAS and MPL -RRB- in a series of CN-AML cases .

Blood , sex and tears : speculations on the gender imbalance in hematologic RAS mutations in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia after successful Heterogeneous leukemic clones identified by [X] mutation analysis in patient [X] mutation is the most common molecular abnormality in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , especially normal karyotype [Y] -LRB- NK-AML -RRB- , and is associated with a favorable prognosis in the absence of concomitant FLT3-ITD .

The [X] mutation is generally used as a molecular marker in the prognosis evaluation of a patient with [Y] .

Influence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication allele burden and white blood cell BACKGROUND : In patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , testing for fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 -LRB- FLT3 -RRB- - internal tandem duplication -LRB- FLT3-ITD -RRB- and nucleophosmin-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations can allow for further prognostic subclassification , but less is known about the effects of FLT3-ITD allele burden and presenting white blood cell count -LRB- WBC -RRB- within molecular subgroups .

On multivariate analysis , after correcting for age , WBC , secondary [Y] , and blast percentage , nucleophosmin-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- - mutated/FLT3-ITD-negative patients had superior overall survival compared with patients in the other molecular subgroups .

CONCLUSIONS : [X] and FLT3-ITD status , age , WBC , and secondary [Y] were identified as important prognostic variables that can help to risk stratify patients with [Y] who have intermediate-risk cytogenetics .

The FLT3ITD mRNA level has a high prognostic impact in [X] mutated , but not in The impact of a FLT3-internal tandem duplication -LRB- FLT3ITD -RRB- on prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is dependent on the ratio of mutated to wild-type allele .

OBJECTIVE : To explore the prevalence of IDH gene -LRB- IDH1 and IDH2 -RRB- mutations , types of mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , correlation with the internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutation of FLT3 gene , [X] gene mutation and some clinical characteristics .

METHODS : The mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 gene at exon , [X] gene at exon and FLT3-ITD at exon and in newly diagnosed [Y] patients were detected by PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA .

Several genes have been identified in [Y] , such as FLT3 , KIT , [X] , and JAK2 .

Mutated regions of nucleophosmin elicit both CD4 -LRB- + -RRB- and CD8 -LRB- + -RRB- T-cell responses Mutations in the nucleophosmin gene -LRB- [X] -LRB- mut -RRB- -RRB- are one of the most frequent molecular alterations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , and immune responses may contribute to the favorable prognosis of [Y] patients with [X] -LRB- mut -RRB- .

Ten peptides derived from wild-type [X] and [X] -LRB- mut -RRB- were subjected to ELISPOT analysis in healthy volunteers and [Y] patients .

A total of % of the [X] -LRB- mut -RRB- [Y] patients showed immune responses against epitope # and % against epitope # .

The results of the present study show that [X] -LRB- mut -RRB- induces specific T-cell responses of CD4 -LRB- + -RRB- and CD8 -LRB- + -RRB- T cells and therefore is a promising target for specific immunotherapies in [Y] .

CONCLUSIONS : We found that DNMT3A and [X] mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with [Y] .

Our objective was to evaluate the suitability of FLT3-ITD as a target for MRD detection by real-time quantitative PCR , in comparison with two other molecular MRD markers , [X] mutation and WT1 overexpression , in adult [Y] patients treated in Acute Leukemia French Association -LRB- ALFA -RRB- trials .

[X] mutations occur in % of patients with [Y] but are absent in patients with CML .

We analyzed for [X] and ABL1 mutations in nine Ph + patients with [Y] and five patients with CML-BP initially presenting in BP .

Two of nine -LRB- % -RRB- patients with Ph + [Y] had [X] mutations and were alive and months after diagnosis .

PATIENTS AND METHODS : We analyzed adults with primary [Y] , treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B first-line trials , who had pretreatment cytogenetics and , for cytogenetically normal patients , mutational status of [X] , CEBPA , and FLT3 available .

Reversal of FLT3 mutational status and sustained expression of [X] mutation in We report a case of de novo acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with unstable FLT3 gene mutations and stable [X] mutation .

Mutations in fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- FLT3 -RRB- gene including internal tandem duplication -LRB- ITD -RRB- and point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain -LRB- TKD -RRB- as well as in nucleoplasmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene are associated with pathogenesis of acute myeloblastic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Several reports have demonstrated high incidences of the FLT3 and [X] mutations in adult [Y] patients .

Since the pathogenesis of pediatric [Y] is different from that of adult and the FLT3 and [X] mutations have not been well characterized in childhood [Y] .

Therefore , the objective of this study was to determine the frequencies of FLT3 and [X] mutations in newly diagnosed childhood [Y] patients .

In conclusion , the FLT3 mutations was found in % but none of [X] mutation was detected in Thai children with [Y] .

-LSB- Establishment of a rapid and easy method for simultaneous detection of FLT3-ITD OBJECTIVE : To establish a stable , rapid multiplex PCR assay combined with PAGE gel electrophoresis for simultaneously detecting FLT3-ITD and [X] mutations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

METHODS : Capillary electrophoresis -LRB- CE -RRB- and PAGE gel electrophoresis were simultaneously used to analyze FLT3-ITD and [X] mutations in de novo [Y] patients with normal cytogenetic findings .

Mutations within the nucleophosmin [X] gene occur in approximately one-third of cases of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Using the similarity feature for data analysis , we demonstrated that this technique could successfully identify cases of [Y] with a [X] mutation based on cytoplasmic [X] protein staining -LRB- at similarity threshold of sensitivity % and specificity % -RRB- .

Using the similarity feature for data analysis , we demonstrated that this technique could successfully identify cases of [Y] with a [X] mutation based on cytoplasmic [X] protein staining -LRB- at similarity threshold of sensitivity % and specificity % -RRB- .

In addition , [Y] with erythroid predominance had a lower frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities as well as a lower frequency of mutations involving [X] , NRAS and FLT3 as compared with [Y] without erythroid predominance .

The t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q25 ; q34 -RRB- of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia A t -LRB- ; -RRB- -LRB- q25 ; q34 -RRB- chromosomal translocation associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- was found to rearrange part of the nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene on chromosome with sequences from a novel gene on chromosome .

Targeting the MLL1 and DOT1L histone modification complexes , both alone and in combination , showed activity against [Y] driven by a mutant [X] protein in several preclinical models and may represent a new treatment direction for this devastating disease .

Targeted sequencing efforts have identified several mutations with diagnostic and prognostic values in KIT , [X] , CEBPA and FLT3 in both adult and paediatric [Y] .

All-trans retinoic acid as adjunct to intensive treatment in younger adult The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the impact of all-trans retinoic acid -LRB- ATRA -RRB- in combination with chemotherapy and to assess the [X] status as biomarker for ATRA therapy in younger adult patients -LRB- years -RRB- with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Patients who had TP53-mutated [Y] had significantly lower incidence of mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase -LRB- FLT3 -RRB- , rat sarcoma -LRB- RAS -RRB- , and nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- and higher incidence of coexisting MPL mutations compared with those who had wild type TP53 .

Karyotype plus [X] mutation status defines a group of elderly patients with [Y] Although it is generally appreciated that a subset of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- may benefit from intensive consolidation , little is known about variables predicting such benefit .

Autophagy mediates proteolysis of [X] and HEXIM1 and sensitivity to BET The mechanisms underlying activation of the BET pathway in [Y] cells remain poorly understood .

We conclude that the degradation of [X] and HEXIM1 through autophagy in certain [Y] subsets contributes to the activation of the BET pathway in these cells .

Mutated [X] in combination with overexpression of Meis1 or Hoxa9 is not BACKGROUND : Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- carrying nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations -LRB- NPMc -LRB- + -RRB- -RRB- is regarded as a separate entity of myeloid neoplasms due to its distinct biological and clinical features .

Establishment of a quenching probe method for detection of [X] mutations in Nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations , generally consisting of a four base-pair insertion , are present in ~ % of all cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- cases .

The curve derived from the fluorescent intensity with respect to the temperature of OCI/AML3 , a heterozygous [X] mutant [Y] cell line , was W-shaped with melting peaks at degrees C and degrees C .

With a short testing time and a high sensitivity , this assay was applicable for NPM1-mutated [Y] patient samples and is appropriate for screening [X] mutations .

Elevated level of miR-125b can contribute to adverse prognosis of [Y] without [X] mutation .

The prevalence of the most frequent single gene [Y] associated mutations differed in cAML and aAML patient cohorts : IDH1 -LRB- % cAML , % aAML -RRB- , IDH2 -LRB- % cAML , % aAML -RRB- , [X] -LRB- % cAML , % aAML -RRB- .

The human nucleophosmin mutation A inhibits myeloid differentiation of leukemia Mutations in the nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene are the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Furthermore , sensitivity of primary [Y] blasts to BV6 correlates with significantly elevated expression levels of TNF and lower levels of XIAP in diagnostic samples , as well as with [X] mutation .

Insights into amyloid-like aggregation of H2 region of the C-terminal domain of Nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- is a multifunctional protein involved in a variety of biological processes including the pathogenesis of several human malignancies and is the most frequently mutated gene in Acute Myeloid Leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

[X] , FLT3 and CEBPA mutations in pediatric patients with [Y] from Argentina : Mutations in [X] , FLT3 and CEBPA genes are found in % of adult acute myeloblastic leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- cases and correlate with prognosis .

[X] and CEBPA mutations were selectively tested in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients with multiplex RT-PCR negativity .

Mutations of the [X] gene are the most frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and result in the expression of a mutant protein with aberrant cytoplasmic localization , NPMc + .

Our results reveal a novel function of NPMc + and provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of [Y] bearing [X] mutations .

Anti-proliferative activity of the [X] interacting natural product Mutated nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- acts as a proto-oncogene and is present in ~ % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

The NPM1-mutated cell line OCI-AML3 and normal karyotype primary [Y] cells with [X] mutations were significantly more sensitive towards AVA than cells expressing wild-type -LRB- wt -RRB- [X] .

AVA treatment induced nuclear retention of the [X] mutant protein -LRB- NPMc + -RRB- in OCI-AML3 cells and primary [Y] cells , caused proteasomal degradation of NPMc + and the nuclear export factor CRM1 and downregulated wt FLT3 protein .

Here , we present a rare case of a patient who was initially diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with mutated [X] .

Diagnostic bone marrow from consecutive de novo [Y] cases was used to test MLL-PTD , FLT3-ITD and TKD , [X] and CEBPAdm mutations .

Correlation of [X] Type A Mutation Burden With Clinical Status and Outcomes in BACKGROUND : Nucleophosmin gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutation may be a good molecular marker for assessing the clinical status and predicting the outcomes in [Y] patients .

METHODS : Twenty-seven [Y] patients with normal karyotype but bearing the mutated [X] were enrolled in the study , and real-time quantitative PCR of NPM1-mutA was performed on bone marrow -LRB- BM -RRB- samples -LRB- samples at diagnosis and at follow-up -RRB- .

The discoveryof additional mutations in genes such as [X] , CEBPA and FLT3 , which are frequent in [Y] patients with a normal karyotype , have improved the precision of risk stratification in [Y] .

FLT3 , [X] and WT1 mutations were associated with an immature phenotype in myeloblastic [Y] , whereas other combinations involving ASXL1 , RUNX1 , MLL-PTD , CEBPA or KRAS were more frequent in myeloblastic [Y] with maturation .

Co-occurrence of FLT3-ITD , [X] and DNMT3A mutations was identified with associated with specific clinical [Y] features and poor outcomes .

Genes involved in the cohesin complex -LRB- STAG2 -RRB- , a splicing factor -LRB- U2AF1 -RRB- and a poorly studied gene , MGA were recurrently mutated , whereas [X] , one of the most frequently mutated [Y] gene , was not mutated in MLL-PTD patients .

This study was aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of IHC on formalin fixed bone marrow biopsies in comparison with the reference molecular method -LRB- allele specific oligonucleotide - polymerase chain reaction ; ASO-PCR -RRB- to predict [X] mutation status in [Y] patients .

METHODS : [X] protein IHC was performed using mouse anti-NPM monoclonal antibody on paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies of patients with primary [Y] of any French-American-British -LRB- FAB -RRB- subtype .

RESULTS : Of the [Y] patients , -LRB- % -RRB- were positive for [X] exon gene mutation by ASO-PCR , -LRB- % -RRB- of these were NPMc + .

Pre-transplant Quantitative Determination of [X] Mutation Significantly Predicts BACKGROUND/AIM : Minimal residual disease -LRB- MRD -RRB- in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation -LRB- alloHSCT -RRB- can influence the results of therapy .

CONCLUSION : Our data showed that the pre-transplant level of MRD in patients with normal karyotype [Y] harboring [X] mutation in CR provides important prognostic information , which as an independent prognostic factor predicts transplant results .

To address this limitation , we here transplanted primary human [Y] with isolated nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutation and [Y] with inv -LRB- -RRB- in mice in which human versions of genes encoding cytokines important for myelopoiesis -LRB- macrophage colony-stimulating factor -LSB- M-CSF -RSB- , interleukin-3 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and thrombopoietin -RRB- were knocked into their respective mouse loci .

Evaluation of Minimal Residual Disease in Acute Myeloid Leukemia with [X] BACKGROUND : Minimal residual disease -LRB- MRD -RRB- tests provide early identification of hematologic relapse and timely management of acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients .

In this retrospective study , we set up a quantitative test for quantifying [X] type A mutation and [Y] patients carrying this mutation at the time of diagnosis , were followed-up .

Because of high frequency , stability , specificity to abnormal clone and high sensitivity , [X] is a suitable marker for monitoring of NPMc + [Y] patients .

Acute myeloid leukemia with mutated nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- : any hope for a targeted Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- carrying nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations displays distinct molecular and clinical-pathological features that led to its inclusion as provisional entity in WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms .

Since [X] mutations behave as a founder genetic lesion in [Y] , they could be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention .

Here , we discuss the potential for developing targeted therapies for NPM1-mutated [Y] with focus on : -LRB- i -RRB- interfering with the abnormal traffic of the [X] leukemic mutant , i.e. , its cytoplasmic dislocation ; -LRB- ii -RRB- disrupting the nucleolar structure/function by interfering with residual wild-type nucleophosmin and other nucleolar components acting as hub proteins ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- evaluating the activity of epigenetic drugs -LRB- e.g. , -RRB- or agents acting on differentiation and apoptosis .

As quantitative assessment of [X] mutated transcript copies now provides the means to measure minimal residual disease , we also discuss the potential for intervening in NPM1-mutated [Y] before overt hematological relapse occurs -LRB- so-called pre-emptive therapy -RRB- .

Integrative prognostic risk score in acute myeloid leukemia with normal To integrate available clinical and molecular information for cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- CN-AML -RRB- patients into one risk score , CN-AML patients from multicenter treatment trials [Y] SHG Hannover and and patients from HOVON/SAKK protocols as external controls were evaluated for mutations/polymorphisms in [X] , FLT3 , CEBPA , MLL , NRAS , IDH1/2 , and WT1 .

CONCLUSION : Our data showed a high frequency of [X] mutations in the monocytic subtypes of [Y] , as well as a high degree of association between the occurrence of [X] and FLT3/ITD mutations .

Molecular-genetic testing for [Y] fusion transcripts associated with a favorable prognosis -LRB- PML/RARalpha , AML1/ETO , and CBFbeta/MYH11 -RRB- were negative , as were other prognostic markers like MLL-PTD , FLT3-ITD , or mutations of FLT3-D835 , [X] , or CEBPA .

After characterization and validation of miR-10a , which was specifically upregulated in nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutant [Y] samples , functional consequences of miR-10a overexpression were further delineated in vitro .

MATERIALS AND METHODS : Microarray analysis of miRNAs in bone marrow samples from [Y] -LRB- IR -RRB- patients with [X] mutations and healthy donors was performed to detect differential expression patterns .

After validation of miRNA expression specific for [X] mutation in [Y] patients by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , a functional target gene search was conducted using complementary DNA microarray data from samples transfected with miR-10a .

RESULTS : In comparison with wild-type samples , [X] mutant [Y] samples were shown to markedly overexpress miR-10a .

Furthermore , we determined an inverse association between miR-10a and MDM4 expression in [Y] -LRB- IR -RRB- samples with respect to their [X] mutational status .

CONCLUSIONS : miR-10a expression is highly characteristic for [Y] -LRB- IR -RRB- patients with [X] mutations and may influence its biological properties in [Y] by interfering with the p53 machinery partly regulated by MDM4 .

Patients with t-AML were older -LRB- P < -RRB- and they had lower white blood counts -LRB- P = -RRB- compared with de novo [Y] patients ; t-AML patients had abnormal cytogenetics more frequently , with overrepresentation of translocations as well as adverse cytogenetics , including complex and monosomal karyotypes , and with underrepresentation of intermediate-risk karyotypes -LRB- P < -RRB- ; t-AML patients had [X] mutations -LRB- P < -RRB- and FLT3 internal tandem duplications -LRB- P = -RRB- less frequently .

Acute myeloid leukemia with mutated nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- : is it a distinct After the discovery of NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- in and its subsequent inclusion as a provisional entity in the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms , several controversial issues remained to be clarified .

It was unclear whether the [X] mutation was a primary genetic lesion and whether additional chromosomal aberrations and multilineage dysplasia had any impact on the biologic and prognostic features of NPM1-mutated [Y] .

Moreover , it was uncertain how to classify [Y] patients who were double-mutated for [X] and CEBPA .

Recent studies have shown that : -LRB- -RRB- the [X] mutant perturbs hemopoiesis in experimental models ; -LRB- -RRB- leukemic stem cells from NPM1-mutated [Y] patients carry the mutation ; and -LRB- -RRB- the [X] mutation is usually mutually exclusive of biallelic CEPBA mutations .

Concurrent mutations in [X] , FLT3 , CEBPA , and NRAS were detected only in [Y] with the IDH1 -LRB- R -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- mutation .

No patient with an [X] mutation alone had disease that progressed to [Y] .

We conclude that FLT3 and [X] mutations are rare in MDS , but assessment of mutation status is potentially useful for predicting progression to [Y] .

Fms like tyrosine kinase -LRB- FLT3 -RRB- and nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations in de novo Mutations in FLT3 and [X] are important prognostic factors in [Y] , influencing outcome in normal karyotype cases .

We here analysed incidences of FLT3/ITD , D and [X] mutations in patients with de novo normal karyotype [Y] using PCR and gene sequencing , along with laboratory parameters and treatment outcomes .

The incidence of FLT3 and [X] mutations was found to be low in Indian patients with normal karyotype [Y] .

They demonstrate that a high LSC score is associated with poor prognosis in [Y] patients and further demonstrate that the score is independent of known prognostic factors , including age , karyotype and mutation of the FLT3 or [X] genes .

Monitoring of minimal residual disease in NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia : a PURPOSE : To evaluate the prognostic value of minimal residual disease -LRB- MRD -RRB- in patients with acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with [X] mutation -LRB- [X] -LRB- mut -RRB- -RRB- .

CONCLUSION : We defined clinically relevant time points for [X] -LRB- mut -RRB- MRD assessment that allow for the identification of patients with [Y] who are at high risk of relapse .

The [X] -LRB- nucleophosmin -RRB- mutations can be monitored by sensitive quantitative real-time PCR in subsets of stem cell recipients with [Y] , but for approximately % of patients , suitable molecular mutations for post-transplant MRD monitoring are not available so far .

Differential expression of the BCR gene in sequential stages of murine An accumulation of cytogenetic and molecular genetic events characterizes the Characterization of NPM1-mutated [Y] with a history of myelodysplastic syndromes The role of the nucleophosmin -LRB- [X] -RRB- mutations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is well analyzed , but the impact in secondary [Y] -LRB- s-AML -RRB- following myelodysplastic syndromes -LRB- MDS -RRB- or transformed myeloproliferative neoplasms -LRB- MPNs -RRB- remains unclear .

Thus , [X] mutations are involved in the transformation from MDS to [Y] or MPN to blast phase in single cases , which should be further confirmed in larger studies .

Mutant nucleophosmin and cooperating pathways drive leukemia initiation and Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a molecularly diverse malignancy with a poor prognosis whose largest subgroup is characterized by somatic mutations in [X] , which encodes nucleophosmin .

It also pointed on some gene mutations -LRB- [X] , CEPBA , FLT3 , WT1 ... -RRB- and their prognostic features in [Y] with a normal karyotype , leading to individualize two new provisional entities in the WHO classification of tumours of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues .

It is concluded that the DNMT3a mutations are more prevalent in [Y] patients with normal karyotype accompanying with positive [X] and/or CEBPA mutation , the role of DNMT3a mutation in [Y] prognosis needs to be further studied .

-LSB- Evaluation of methods for detection of [X] gene mutations in acute myeloid The purpose of this study was to establish real-time based methods for detection of [X] gene mutation in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

-LSB- The clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients OBJECTIVE : To investigate the clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with [X] mutation .

METHODS : [X] mutation -LRB- including A , B , D mutation type -RRB- was detected in patients with newly diagnosed [Y] by real-time quantitative RT-PCR .

RESULTS : The incidence of [X] mutation was % in total [Y] patients and % in normal karyotypes [Y] patients .

CONCLUSION : It is necessary to detect [X] mutation and FLT3-ITD in newly diagnosed [Y] patients , especially in patients with high WBC and BPC , CD34-negative , normal karyotype , which might help to molecular classification and treatment .

OBJECTIVE : To examine the incidence and clinical significance of [X] mutations in childhood acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients .

METHODS : [X] mutations of newly diagnosed childhood [Y] were detected by high resolution melting -LRB- HRM -RRB- analysis on the LightCycler .

RESULTS : [X] mutations were identified in -LRB- % -RRB- of the [Y] children .

CONCLUSION : [X] mutations were relatively common in our cohort of [Y] patients .

Univariable survival analysis shows that -LRB- -RRB- patients with FLT3 -LRB- ITD -RRB- mutations have inferior overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- and event-free survival -LRB- EFS -RRB- , whereas CEBPA -LRB- DM -RRB- and [X] mutations indicate favorable OS and EFS in intermediate-risk [Y] , and -LRB- -RRB- high transcript levels of BAALC , CD34 , MN1 , EVl1 , and ERG predict inferior OS and EFS .

Cytogenetically normal [Y] [X] -LRB- + -RRB- or CEBPA -LRB- + -RRB- and FLT3-ITD -LRB- - -RRB- had the same outcome as those with favorable cytogenetics .

STUDY DESIGN : Acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic progenitor cells that presents genetic abnormalities in several genes , including [X] .

Mutations of the [X] gene occur in % of patients with [Y] with normal karyotype , causing cytoplasmic rather than nuclear localization of the protein .

CONCLUSION : [X] immunostaining is a feasible test , without problems of interpretation for pathologists , when the sections are optimally prepared and can be considered predictive of peculiar phenotypic and karyotype subtypes of [Y] , in addition to the well-known prognostic role .

A scoring system integrating TET2 mutation with FLT3-ITD , [X] , and CEBPA mutations could well separate [Y] patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics into groups with different prognoses -LRB- P < -RRB- .

PATIENTS AND METHODS : MLL5 transcript levels from patients with [Y] who were treated in multicenter trials [Y] SHG and [Y] SHG and healthy volunteers were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in the context of other molecular markers -LRB- [X] , FLT3 , CEBPA , IDH1/IDH2 , NRAS , KIT , MN1 , BAALC , ERG , and WT1 -RRB- .

[X] is mutated in approximately one-third of patients with [Y] .

Here , we determined the effects of targeting [X] in cultured and primary [Y] cells .

Treatment with siRNA to [X] induced p53 and p21 , decreased the percentage of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle , as well as induced differentiation of the [Y] OCI-AML3 cells that express both NPMc + and unmutated [X] .

Notably , knockdown of [X] by shRNA abolished lethal [Y] phenotype induced by OCI-AML3 cells in NOD/SCID mice .

Inhibition of [X] oligomerization by NSC348884 induced apoptosis and sensitized OCI-AML3 and primary [Y] cells expressing NPM1c + to ATRA .

This effect was significantly less in [Y] cells coexpressing FLT3-ITD , or in [Y] or normal CD34 + progenitor cells expressing wild-type [X] .

Thus , attenuating levels or oligomerization of [X] selectively induces apoptosis and sensitizes NPM1c + expressing [Y] cells to treatment with ATRA and cytarabine .

Fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab chemotherapy followed by rituximab Recent results of treatment of early stage Hodgkin lymphoma : risk-adapted Molecular analysis of WT1 and KIT mutations in patients from an Indian population Mutations of the WT1 gene have been reported as the most common abnormality after [X] and FLT3 gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , while KIT mutations are predominantly found in core-binding factor -LRB- CBF -RRB- AMLs .

Because the [X] antibody recently became commercially available , we immunostained a series of diagnosed [Y] samples .

We performed [X] immunostaining in [Y] cases .

A novel [X] mutation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with a distinct clinical Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- FALS -RRB- accounts for about % of cases of the neurodegenerative disorder [Y] .

In conclusion , The [X] exon mutation is likely to be the etiological factor of [Y] in this family .

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : In this study , using the well-established [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mouse model of [Y] and a new in-house ELISA method , we have validated that plasma neurofilament heavy chain protein -LRB- NfH -RRB- levels correlate with both functional markers of late stage disease progression and treatment response .

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : These results show that plasma NfH levels closely reflect later stages of disease progression and therapeutic response in the [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mouse model of [Y] and may potentially be a valuable biomarker of later disease progression in [Y] .

The ability of C4F6 to differentiate pathologically affected tissue in mutant [X] [Y] rodent models and humans , specifically motor neuron populations , suggests that this antibody may recognize a `` toxic '' form of the mutant [X] protein .

[X] and mitochondria in [Y] : a dangerous liaison .

METHODS : Screening for [X] , TARDBP , FUS , ANG , ATXN2 , OPTN , and C9ORF72 was carried out in consecutive patients with sporadic [Y] -LRB- SALS -RRB- and in familial [Y] -LRB- FALS -RRB- index patients admitted to a single Italian referral center .

A subset of [Y] cases is caused by mutations in the gene for Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , which impart a toxic gain of function to this antioxidant enzyme .

An over-oxidized form of superoxide dismutase found in sporadic amyotrophic Recent studies suggest that Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- could be pathogenic in both familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- through either inheritable or nonheritable modifications .

The presence of a misfolded WT [X] in patients with sporadic [Y] , along with the recently reported evidence that reducing [X] levels in astrocytes derived from sporadic patients inhibits astrocyte-mediated toxicity on motor neurons , suggest that WT [X] may acquire toxic properties similar to familial ALS-linked mutant [X] , perhaps through posttranslational modifications .

Using patients ' lymphoblasts , we show here that indeed WT [X] is modified posttranslationally in sporadic [Y] and is iper-oxidized -LRB- i.e. , above baseline oxidation levels -RRB- in a subset of patients with bulbar onset .

This study conclusively demonstrates the existence of an iper-oxidized [X] with toxic properties in patient-derived cells and identifies a common SOD1-dependent toxicity between mutant SOD1-linked familial [Y] and a subset of sporadic [Y] , providing an opportunity to develop biomarkers to subclassify [Y] and devise SOD1-based therapies that go beyond the small group of patients with mutant [X] .

In order to evaluate novel treatment options for this disease , genetic mouse models of [Y] have been generated based on human familial mutations in the SOD gene , such as the [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mutation .

We screened mutations in the [X] , FUS , TARDBP , ANG , and OPTN genes in consecutively enrolled Korean patients with [Y] from October to November .

All seven [Y] patients from this family harboured a mutation located in the fourth intron of the [X] gene .

This case report suggests that [X] mutations might be associated with marked phenotypic variability -LRB- [Y] or early onset Parkinsonism in this family -RRB- .

A novel P66S mutation in exon of the [X] gene with early onset and rapid Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a fatal motor neuron disease in adults of unknown origin in most cases .

Here we report a novel P66S mutation in exon of the [X] gene in an apparently sporadic [Y] patient with unusual early onset and rapid disease progression .

Our data widen the spectrum of [X] mutations and clinical presentations of [Y] .

Stem cell transplantation into the intraventricular space via an Ommaya reservoir Stem cells have been highlighted for a possible clinical trial in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , and have been employed in [X] mice and [Y] patients .

Aberrant localization of FUS and TDP43 is associated with misfolding of [X] in BACKGROUND : Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is incurable and characterized by progressive paralysis of the muscles of the limbs , speech and swallowing , and respiration due to the progressive degeneration of voluntary motor neurons .

Clinically indistinguishable [Y] can be caused by genetic mutations of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , TAR-DNA binding protein -LRB- TDP43 -RRB- , or fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma -LRB- FUS/TLS -RRB- , or can occur in the absence of known mutation as sporadic disease .

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Patient spinal cord necropsy immunohistochemistry with [X] misfolding-specific antibodies revealed misfolded [X] in perikarya and motor axons of SOD1-familial [Y] -LRB- SOD1-FALS -RRB- , and in motor axons of R521C-FUS FALS and sporadic [Y] -LRB- SALS -RRB- with cytoplasmic TDP43 inclusions .

As aging is the greatest risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , we were interested in determining if DAF-2 signaling modifies disease pathology in mutant superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- expressing C. elegans .

Genetic as well as pharmacological inhibition of Epha4 signaling rescues the mutant [X] phenotype in zebrafish and increases survival in mouse and rat models of [Y] .

Reduced protein O-glycosylation in the nervous system of the mutant [X] In the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , a number of proteins have been found to be hyperphosphorylated , including neurofilament proteins -LRB- NFs -RRB- .

We determined the expression of Wnt3a , beta-catenin , and Cyclin D1 in the adult spinal cord of [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- [Y] transgenic mice at different stages by RT-PCR , Western blot , and immunofluorescence labeling techniques .

Here we hypothesized that Ex-4 may provide neuroprotective activity in [Y] , and hence characterized Ex-4 actions in both cell culture -LRB- NSC-19 neuroblastoma cells -RRB- and in vivo -LRB- [X] G93A mutant mice -RRB- models of [Y] .

Recreation of a phenotype strikingly similar to that of mutant [X] mouse and human [Y] , like muscle weakness and atrophy owing to lower motor neuron degeneration was observed following the targeted deletion of the hypoxia response element -LRB- HRE -RRB- from promoter of mouse vascular endothelial growth factor -LRB- VEGF -RRB- .

Here , we present a system to enable this in the form of the [Y] Online Database -LRB- ALSoD at http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk -RRB- , a freely available database that has been transformed from a single gene storage facility recording mutations in the [X] gene to a multigene [Y] bioinformatics repository and analytical instrument combining genotype , phenotype , and geographical information with associated analysis tools .

Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- are found in familial forms of the disease and have played an important role in the study of [Y] pathophysiology .

Approximately % of familial [Y] cases are caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene .

Notably , OPTN-positive inclusions are observed not only in familial [Y] with OPTN mutation but also in sporadic [Y] and in familial [Y] with [X] and fused in sarcoma mutations , suggesting that OPTN - and NF-kappaB-related pathways are relevant to the general pathomechanisms of [Y] .

In about % of cases [Y] is familiar and in a relevant percent of these cases , mutations of the enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- are found .

It exerts neuroprotective effects in NMDA-injected CD-1 mice , delays the onset and progression of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- disease in [X] transgenic mice , and , after the onset of [Y] , it increases the survival of motor neurons in the SC by % .

Mutations in the gene for superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- cause a familial form of [Y] and have been used to develop transgenic mice which overexpress human mutant [X] -LRB- mSOD -RRB- and these mice exhibit a motoneuron disease which is pathologically and phenotypically similar to [Y] .

However , daily administration of dantrolene to mice overexpressing superoxide dismutase glycine to alanine at position -LRB- [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- -RRB- does affect neither survival nor the number of motor neurons and ubiquitin aggregates indicating that calcium release through RyRs does not contribute to the selective motor neuron death in this animal model for [Y] .

Early steps in oxidation-induced [X] misfolding : implications for non-amyloid Among the diseases of protein misfolding , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is unusual in that the proteinaceous neuronal inclusions that are the hallmark of the disease have neither the classic fibrillar appearance of amyloid by transmission electron microscopy nor the affinity for the dye Congo red that is a defining feature of amyloid .

Mutations in the Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- cause the largest subset of inherited [Y] cases .

Here , we present evidence that hydrogen peroxide treatment , which generates free radical species at the [X] active site , causes oxidative damage to active-site histidine residues , leading to major structural changes and non-amyloid aggregation similar to that seen in [Y] .

Prolonged survival and milder impairment of motor function in the [X] [Y] mouse Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective motoneuron loss in brain and spinal cord .

The ALS-mouse model over-expressing a mutant human [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- gene closely mimics human [Y] disease .

In order to evaluate a role of FGF-2 in [Y] pathogenesis , double mouse mutants transgenic for the human [X] mutation and lacking the endogenous FGF-2 gene were generated .

However , such interactions for the case of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- protein , which is related to fatal neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , have not been explored yet .

Human neural stem cell replacement therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by BACKGROUND : Mutation in the ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- causes an inherited form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

In this study , we evaluated the expression of ALS-associated proteins in spinal motor neurons -LRB- MNs -RRB- in [Y] patients with mutations in C9orf72 -LRB- C9orf72 -LRB- GGGGCC -RRB- - [Y] ; n = -RRB- , [X] -LRB- mtSOD1-ALS ; n = -RRB- , FUS/TLS -LRB- mtFUS/TLS-ALS ; n = -RRB- , or TARDBP -LRB- mtTDP-43-ALS ; n = -RRB- and contrasted these to cases of sporadic [Y] -LRB- sALS ; n = -RRB- and familial [Y] without known mutations -LRB- fALS ; n = -RRB- .

In mutant forms of [X] that cause familial [Y] -LRB- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -RRB- , this disulfide bond is more susceptible to chemical reduction , which may lead to destabilization of the dimer and aggregation .

In mutant [X] transgenic mice , the most popular disease model of familial [Y] , the mutant [X] selectively associates with and damages mitochondria , leading to defect of axonal transport because of diminished ATP fuel supply for the molecular motors such as kinesin family or dynein/dynactin complex .

To address this question , we have compared gene expression profile of spinal cords of [X] mice and sporadic [Y] patients by establishing the cell-type specific transcriptome .

Approximately % of familial [Y] cases are caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene .

We investigated motor axon excitability in presymptomatic and symptomatic [X] -LRB- G127X -RRB- mutants , a mouse model of [Y] with late clinical onset and rapid disease progression .

In the present study , we used SOD1G93A transgenic mice as an in vivo [Y] model and replaced microglia expressing mutant [X] -LRB- mSOD1 -RRB- with microglia expressing wild-type [X] -LRB- w/tSOD1 -RRB- to modulate the toxic microenvironment .

Targeting of monomer/misfolded [X] as a therapeutic strategy for amyotrophic There is increasing evidence that toxicity of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is linked to its propensity to misfold and to aggregate .

In contrast , we have previously shown , using a specific antibody -LSB- [X] exposed dimer interface -LRB- SEDI -RRB- antibody -RSB- , that the dimer interface of [X] is abnormally exposed both in mutant [X] transgenic mice and in familial [Y] cases associated with mutations in the [X] gene -LRB- fALS1 -RRB- .

Our results support that [X] misfolding/aggregation plays a central role in SOD1-linked [Y] pathogenesis and identifies monomeric/misfolded [X] as a therapeutic target for SOD1-related [Y] .

Approximately percent of familial [Y] cases are caused by mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene .

We investigated the possibility that a reduction in [X] protein may be of therapeutic benefit in [Y] and screened compounds for inhibition of [X] transcription .

One of the earliest signs of the disease in the transgenic G93A [X] mouse model of [Y] is loss of motor neuron contact at the neuromuscular junctions -LRB- NMJ -RRB- in limb muscles .

METHODS : French TARDBP + patients with [Y] -LRB- n = -RRB- were compared first to cohorts : sporadic [Y] -LRB- SALS -RRB- , nonmutated familial [Y] -LRB- FALS -RRB- , and [X] + FALS , and then to TARDBP + cases from the literature .

A subset of [Y] cases are familial and associated with mutations in superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- that destabilize the protein and predispose it to aggregation .

Statistically significant hits that modulate [X] levels , when analyzed by pathway analysis revealed a highly ranked network containing TAR DNA binging protein -LRB- TDP-43 -RRB- , a major component of aggregates characteristic of sporadic [Y] .

Molecular signatures of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression in hind AIMS : This study utilized proteomics , biochemical and enzymatic assays , and bioinformatics tools that characterize protein alterations in hindlimb -LRB- gastrocnemius -RRB- and forelimb -LRB- triceps -RRB- muscles in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- -LRB- [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- -RRB- mouse model .

Therefore , we screened familial [Y] -LRB- FALS -RRB- patients from families , and large cohorts of sporadic [Y] -LRB- SALS -RRB- patients and control subjects for mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein -LRB- TARDBP -RRB- , fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma -LRB- FUS/TLS -RRB- , superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- , angiogenin -LRB- ANG -RRB- and chromosome open reading frame -LRB- C9orf72 -RRB- .

Marked synergism between mutant [X] and glutamate transport inhibition in the Loss of astrocytic glutamate transport capacity in [Y] spinal cord supports an excitotoxic contribution to motor neuron -LRB- MN -RRB- damage in the disease , and dominant gain of function mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- cause certain familial forms of [Y] .

These observations illustrate the utility of the organotypic culture model for the investigation of intracellular interactions underlying MN degeneration in [Y] , and support the hypothesis that activation of Ca-AMPA channels on MNs provides a metabolic burden that synergizes with deleterious effects of mutant [X] in the induction of MN injury .

D-serine is increased two-fold in spinal cords of G93A Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- mice -- the standard model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

A novel c. > G -LRB- L117V -RRB- [X] mutation was found in two Syrian [Y] families living in Europe .

In contrast , elevated levels of misfolded [X] protein were found in fibroblasts from [Y] patients carrying seven other mutations in the [X] gene .

We conclude that mutations in [X] that result in a fully stable protein are associated with low disease penetrance for [Y] and may be found in cases of apparently sporadic [Y] .

Amyloid precursor protein -LRB- APP -RRB- contributes to pathology in the [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mouse In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , the progressive loss of motor neurons is accompanied by extensive muscle denervation , resulting in paralysis and ultimately death .

Upregulation of amyloid beta -LRB- A4 -RRB- precursor protein -LRB- APP -RRB- in muscle fibres coincides with symptom onset in both sporadic [Y] patients and the [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mouse model of familial [Y] .

Olesoxime -LRB- TRO19622 -RRB- , a novel neuroprotective and reparative compound identified in a high-throughput screen based on motoneuron -LRB- MN -RRB- survival , delays disease onset and improves survival in mutant [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mice , a model for [Y] .

We analyzed the relationship of NRG1 isoform expression to glial cell activation and motor neuron loss in spinal cords of [Y] patients and during disease progression in the superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- [Y] mouse model .

Microgliosis , astrocytosis , and motor neuron loss were observed in the ventral horns in [Y] patients and were increased in [X] mice along with disease progression .

Increased NRG1 receptor activation was observed on activated microglia in both [Y] patients and in [X] mice .

Nuclear localization of human [X] and mutant SOD1-specific disruption of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that causes degeneration of motor neurons and paralysis .

Approximately % of familial [Y] cases have been linked to mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene , but it is unclear how mutations in the protein result in motor neuron degeneration .

In a London clinic cohort , the HREM was the most common mutation in familial [Y] + / - FTD : C9ORF72 -LRB- % -RRB- , [X] -LRB- % -RRB- , TARDBP -LRB- % -RRB- and FUS -LRB- % -RRB- and detected in -LRB- % -RRB- of unselected sporadic [Y] cases but was rare in controls -LRB- , % -RRB- .

We identify a mechanism for `` gel shifting '' that predominates among a set of [Y] -LRB- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -RRB- mutant hSOD1 -LRB- superoxide dismutase -RRB- proteins , post-translationally modified hSOD1 proteins , and homologous [X] proteins from different organisms .

The arylsulfanyl pyrazolone -LRB- ASP -RRB- scaffold was one of the active scaffolds identified in a cell-based high throughput screening assay targeting mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- induced toxicity and aggregation as a marker for [Y] .

We applied this methodology to [X] , wild-type , and Ala4Val mutant -LRB- A4V -RRB- , a mutation found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- because decreased Zn affinity to [X] mutants is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease .

Using an [Y] mouse model carrying a high copy number of a mutant human superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- -LRB- G93A -RRB- transgene , we investigated the effect of neural induction on the innate therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells -LRB- MSCs -RRB- in relation to preclinical transplantation parameters .

Genetic studies have linked mutations in several genes to [Y] , and mice bearing mutations in [X] recapitulate hallmark features of the disease .

Apart from pathogenic proteins , such as TDP-43 and [X] , other proteins are associated with [Y] inclusions including small heat shock proteins .

This case report comments on a patient with familial [Y] caused by I113T mutation in the [X] gene presenting with progressive cognitive and behavioral decline two years before developing progressive motor degeneration .

Our case study describes two siblings with familial [Y] , confirmed by the identification of the L84F mutation in the [X] gene , and RDB .

In the present study , we analyzed the potential therapeutic effect of the sigma-1R agonist -LRB- PRE-084 -RRB- in the [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mouse model of [Y] .

Abnormalities to dynein in particular are linked to [Y] , and defects in dynein-mediated axonal transport processes have been reported as one of the earliest pathologies in transgenic [X] mice .

This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the specific mechanisms underlying intracellular neuronal pathology during Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration -LRB- FTLD -RRB- , including [X] , TDP-43 and FUS protein inclusions and the potential of these proteins to be involved in pathogenic prion-like mechanisms .

CONCLUSIONS : The frequency of FUS mutations is approximately % in our [X] - , ANG - , TARDBP-mutation-negative sporadic [Y] cohort and similar to that reported in previous studies from Asia in our familial [Y] cohort .

In conclusion , ANG mutations accounted for % of our [X] - , FUS - , TARDBP - mutation-negative [Y] cohort .

The triggers for ER stress are as yet unclear , but induction of UPR sensor proteins , up-regulation of chaperones and induction of cell death proteins have been described in human post mortem [Y] tissue and in mutant superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- expressing models of [Y] .

Pyrimethamine decreases levels of [X] in leukocytes and cerebrospinal fluid of The mutated [X] protein appears to have a gene dose-dependent effect on the severity and progression of [Y] .

To determine if there was a similar effect in humans , we performed a phase I pilot study in [Y] patients with [X] mutations , weeks in duration .

Thus , PYR use may be associated with a reduction in [X] in [Y] patients .

Influence of methylene blue on microglia-induced inflammation and motor neuron Mutations in [X] cause hereditary variants of the fatal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Since [Y] has been linked to mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , oxidative stress is regarded as a major cause of [Y] .

The use of cellular and animal models of [Y] , particularly those expressing mutant [X] , the gene mutation most represented in familiar [Y] , has provided significant evidence for a role of UPS in protein inclusions formation and motor neuron death .

We will also discuss the finding that , unlike the constitutive proteasome subunits , the inducible subunits are overexpressed early during disease progression in [X] mice models of [Y] .

Evidence from patients with sporadic and familiar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and from models based on the overexpression of mutant [X] found in a small subset of patients , clearly point to mitochondrial damage as a relevant facet of this neurodegenerative condition .

Conversely , mutations in [X] , TARDBP , and FUS typically cause pure [Y] , with adult onset between and years of age and usually rapid progression over to years .

Identification of Tau and [X] gene mutation in a small Chinese Han pedigree of We report the clinical profile , and a brief investigation of [X] and Tau gene mutation from a small Chinese Han pedigree of adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , which consisted of familial members with affected individuals spanning five generations , and presenting autosomal dominant genetic mode .

To determine the effects of the intravenous injection of MSCs in an [Y] mouse model during the symptomatic stage of disease , MSCs -LRB- x -LRB- -RRB- -RRB- were intravenously injected in mice expressing human superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- carrying the G93A mutation -LRB- SOD1/G93A -RRB- presenting with experimental [Y] .

To analyze a possible therapeutic effect of TFAM on [Y] pathology , double transgenic mice overexpressing G93A mutant [X] -LRB- G93ASOD1 -RRB- and human TFAM -LRB- hTFAM -RRB- were newly generated in the present study .

[X] mutations cause rare familial forms of [Y] and have provided the most widely studied animal models .

The mechanism of this fibrillation process is yet poorly understood , but attains considerable interest due to [X] 's involvement in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Finally , we examine by comparison with in vivo data to what extent this mode of fibrillation , originating from selective amplification of mechanically brittle aggregates by sample agitation , captures the mechanism of pathological [X] aggregation in [Y] .

Evidence for such a prion-like mechanism has now spread to the main misfolded proteins , [X] and TDP-43 , implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

For several years , only one gene was known to have a role in [Y] pathogenesis , [X] .

A minority of patients carries mutations in the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene but the disease mechanism remains unknown for all types of [Y] .

Using a GC-TOFMS platform we studied the cerebrospinal fluid -LRB- CSF -RRB- metabolome in [Y] patients with six different mutations in the [X] gene and compared with ALS-patients without such mutations .

In particular , the eight patients homozygous for the D90A [X] mutation showed a distinctively different signature when modeled against [Y] patients with other [X] mutations and sporadic and familial [Y] patients without a [X] gene mutation .

ALS-patients with a [X] gene mutation appear as a distinct metabolic entity in the CSF , in particular in patients with the D90A mutation , the most frequently identified cause of [Y] .

Evidence for such a prion-like propagation mechanism has now spread to the major misfolded proteins , superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- and the kDa transactive response DNA binding protein -LRB- TDP-43 -RRB- , implicated in [Y] .

Misfolded [X] and [Y] : zeroing in on mitochondria .

Mutations in [X] , causative for a subset of familial [Y] cases , are associated with the formation of non-normal [X] conformers .

Mutant superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , a cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Spinal muscular atrophy -LRB- SMA -RRB- and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- are among the most common motor neuron diseases to afflict the human population .

In this study , we show that mutant superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- , a cause of familial [Y] , profoundly alters the sub-cellular localization of the SMN protein , preventing the formation of nuclear ` gems ' by disrupting the recruitment of the protein to Cajal bodies .

Overexpressing the SMN protein in mutant [X] mice , a model of familial [Y] , alleviates this phenomenon , most likely in a cell-autonomous manner , and significantly mitigates the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and in culture dishes .

Bim links ER stress and apoptosis in cells expressing mutant [X] associated with Endoplasmic reticulum -LRB- ER -RRB- stress is an important pathway to cell death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Most of our knowledge about the pathophysiological mechanisms of [Y] comes from transgenic mice models that emulate a subgroup of familial [Y] cases -LRB- FALS -RRB- , with mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

In the present study , we use this approach to shed light on the cytotoxic action of the metalloenzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , associated with misfolding and aggregation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Here , we briefly review the evidence for mitochondrial dysfunctions in familial [Y] and discuss a possible link between mutant [X] and mitochondrial dysfunction .

In particular , mutant types of superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- and TAR DNA binding protein -LRB- TDP-43 -RRB- are key molecules involved in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic [Y] , respectively .

This was the only KEGG disease pathway significantly upregulated among , and contributing genes , including [X] , represented % of the encoded proteins or protein complexes of the KEGG [Y] pathway .

In this study , expression levels of AQP4 and Kir4 were for the first time examined in the brainstem and cortex , along with the functional properties of Kir channels in cultured cortical astrocytes of the [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- rat model of [Y] .

Impaired response of hypoxic sensor protein HIF-1alpha and its downstream We have recently reported spinal blood flow-metabolism uncoupling in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- animal model using Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- - transgenic -LRB- Tg -RRB- mice , suggesting a relative hypoxia in the spinal cord .

Recent studies have shown that two [Y] associated proteins , TDP-43 and superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , are involved in the abnormal autophagy regulation .

A novel exon mutation -LRB- P66S -RRB- in the [X] gene in familial [Y] .

Mutant SOD1G93A triggers mitochondrial fragmentation in spinal cord motor Mutations in the Cu/Zn Superoxide Dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene cause an inherited form of [Y] with upper and lower motor neuron loss .

This data suggests that impairment in mitochondrial dynamics participates in [Y] and restoring this defect might provide protection against mutant [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- - induced neuronal injury .

Effect of the bp deletion polymorphism in the [X] promoter on [X] mRNA The genetic association between homozygosity for a bp deletion polymorphism in the [X] promoter , bp upstream of the ATG , and an increased age of symptom onset was observed in various populations of [Y] patients .

In the present study , we used [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mutant transgenic mice as the animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and investigated the changes of TRPV4 immunoreactivity in the central nervous system of these mice by immunohistochemical studies .

This study , which showed increased TRPV4 in different brain and spinal cord regions of [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- transgenic mice , may provide clues to the understanding of many basic neuronal functions in [Y] .

In vivo pathogenic role of mutant [X] localized in the mitochondrial Mutations in Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Together , our findings indicate that mutant [X] in the mitochondrial IMS causes mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration , but per se it is not sufficient to cause a full-fledged [Y] phenotype , which requires the participation of mutant [X] localized in other cellular compartments .

To clarify the effects of genetic background and gender on gross phenotypes among different [Y] models , we here conducted a comparative analysis of growth curves and lifespans using congenic lines of [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- and [X] -LRB- H46R -RRB- mice on two different genetic backgrounds ; C57BL/6N -LRB- B6 -RRB- and FVB/N -LRB- FVB -RRB- .

Conversely , consistent with our previous study using B6 lines , lack of Als2 , a murine homolog for the recessive juvenile [Y] causative gene , in FVB congenic [X] -LRB- H46R -RRB- , but not [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- , mice resulted in an earlier death , implying a genetic background-independent but mutation-dependent phenotypic modification .

The present study thus provides direct evidence of activated UPR in motor neurons which overexpress human pathogenic mutant [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- , providing evidence that ER stress plays a major role in [Y] .

Genetic biomarkers for [Y] disease in transgenic [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mice .

Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed on transgenic [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mice , a mouse model of [Y] , to determine genetic biomarkers of disease longevity .

Furthermore , similarities in clinical phenotypes and neuropathology of [Y] cases with and without mutations in sod1 gene have implied a disease mechanism involving [X] common to all [Y] cases .

Although pathogenic roles of wild-type [X] in sporadic [Y] remain controversial , recent developments of novel [X] antibodies have made it possible to characterize wild-type [X] under pathological conditions of [Y] .

Chiral cyclohexane as inhibitors of mutant SOD1-dependent protein Cyclohexane were identified as a class of molecules exhibiting a protective effect against mutant [X] induced toxicity in PC-12 cells , but an optimized analogue had little or no effect on life extension in the G93A [X] mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

In the present study , we used [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mutant transgenic mice as an in vivo model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- and performed immunohistochemical studies , RT-PCR and western blotting analysis in order to investigate the changes of SIRT1 immunoreactivity in the central nervous system of these mice .

This study , which showed increased SIRT1 in different brain regions of [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- transgenic mice , may provide clues to the understanding of selective neuronal loss in [Y] .

Some % of kindreds in which [Y] is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion have mutations in the gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- encoding Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- SOD -RRB- .

D90A heterozygosity in the [X] gene is associated with familial and apparently All mutations in the [X] gene associated with familial [Y] behave as dominant traits .

The mechanism through which the mutations in the [X] gene cause [Y] still remain unknown .

We report three additional mutations occurring in the [X] gene in [Y] patients and two single base pair variant changes .

An individual with an apparently sporadic case of [Y] carries a three base pair deletion in exon of the [X] gene .

These three mutations bring to the total number of distinct [X] mutations associated with familial [Y] .

A novel two-base mutation in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene associated with We have identified a novel two-base mutation in exon of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene -LRB- TGC to TTT -RRB- , which resulted in Cys6 to Phe substitution in a Japanese family with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

None of the human [X] mutations found in the familial form of [Y] were detected in [X] of the affected horses .

To investigate immunohistochemical alterations of SOD in the spinal cord affected with the disease , we examined patients with [X] mutation-associated family with [Y] , patients with sporadic [Y] and control individuals .

These results indicate that [X] may be involved in the formative process of LBHIs especially in familial [Y] but not always in that of SIs or BBs , and imply that SOD2 may have no connection with any of these ALS-related abnormal structures .

Mechanisms of selective motor neuron death in transgenic mouse models of motor To examine the mechanism -LRB- s -RRB- of disease underlying [Y] , transgenic mouse models have been constructed that express aberrant neurofilaments or mutations in the abundant , cytoplasmic enzyme superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Additional mice expressing familial ALS-linked mutations in the cytoplasmic enzyme [X] , the only proven cause of [Y] and which accounts for approximately % of familial disease , have demonstrated that at least one mutation causes disease through acquisition of an adverse property by the mutant enzyme , rather than elevation or loss of [X] activity .

However , the mechanism by which the mutations in [X] lead to [Y] is unknown .

To examine whether mutation in neurofilament subunits causes or predisposes to [Y] , we used single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with DNA sequencing to search for mutations in the entirety of the human NF-L , NF-M , and NF-H genes from familial [Y] patients known not to carry mutations in superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , as well as from sporadic [Y] patients .

Recently we and others identified several single-base mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene in patients with familial [Y] -LRB- FALS -RRB- .

In addition , in patients with sporadic [Y] and age - and sex-matched controls , red blood cell [X] activity was normal .

These studies indicate that [X] activity is reduced in these FALS patients but not in sporadic [Y] patients .

Moreover , this [X] enzyme abnormality is detectable years before onset of clinical [Y] in carriers of this FALS mutation .

Increased -LSB- -RSB- glutathione binding sites in spinal cords from patients with Recent observations have suggested abnormalities in the gene for superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- in patients with the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Recently , it was found that some patients with autosomal-dominant familial [Y] -LRB- FALS -RRB- have point mutations in the gene that encodes Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

In this study of postmortem brain tissue , we examined SOD activity and quantified protein carbonyl groups , a marker of oxidative damage , in samples of frontal cortex -LRB- Brodmann area -RRB- from control patients , three FALS patients with known [X] mutations -LRB- FALS-1 -RRB- , one autosomal-dominant FALS patient with no identifiable [X] mutations -LRB- FALS-O -RRB- , and sporadic [Y] -LRB- SALS -RRB- patients .

Analysis of chromosome genes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis : homozygous Although defects in the gene encoding the enzyme cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- have been reported in % of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- patients , the etiology of the remaining familial cases and the more common sporadic form of the disease remains unknown .

Advances in the last years in molecular biology and genetics have identified mutations in the cytosolic dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene in some patients with familial [Y] raising the possibility that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis .

Additional mice expressing point mutations in the cytoplasmic enzyme superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , the only known cause of [Y] , have proved that disease arises from a toxic property of the mutant enzyme rather than loss of enzymatic activity .

Absence of [X] gene abnormalities in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with A man with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- with posterior column involvement showed fairly slow progression of the illness and lived with the aid of a respirator for years .

There seem to be certain heterogeneities in familial [Y] with posterior column involvement , and [X] gene abnormalities may be involved in the pathomechanism in rapidly progressing [Y] , in which there are Lewy-body-like hyaline inclusions .

The yeast interaction trap system allowed us to determine whether these mutations in [X] caused novel protein interactions not observed with wild-type [X] and which might participate in the generation of the [Y] phenotype .

[X] missense mutation in an Italian family with [Y] .

This study confirms the presence of [X] point mutations in families with autosomal-dominant [Y] and suggests that additional genetic or environmental factors may be involved in the full expression of the disease .

In conclusion , we identified a novel [X] mutation in an [Y] family , which is an important addition to the catalog of [X] mutations in [Y] .

Non-covalent Interactions between Superoxide Dismutase and Flavonoids Studied by Misfolding and aggregation of Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is implicated in the etiology amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

Our understanding of this disease has been greatly facilitated by studies of familial [Y] caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Because the pathogenicity of mutant [X] is proportional to the dose of the toxic protein , a rational approach to treating SOD1-related [Y] is to reduce levels of the toxic [X] species .

Gibbs Energy of Superoxide Dismutase Heterodimerization Accounts for Variable The exchange of subunits between homodimeric mutant Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- and wild-type -LRB- WT -RRB- [X] is suspected to be a crucial step in the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

The DeltaGHet of each [Y] variant [X] correlated with patient survival time after diagnosis -LRB- R -LRB- -RRB- = -RRB- , with more favorable DeltaGHet correlating with shorter survival by years per kJ .

In particular , glycation seems to have a determining role both in sporadic and familial forms of [Y] and [X] has been shown to be glycated in vivo The aim of this study was to investigate the role of glycation on the amyloid aggregation process of both wild-type [X] and its ALS-related mutant G93A .

In the present study , we investigated neurodegenerative changes including neuronal loss and glia pathology in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus -LRB- AD -RRB- of [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mice , a widely used animal model for [Y] .

Our results from the [X] model suggest that dendritic and dendritic spine changes foreshadow and underpin the neuromotor phenotypes present in [Y] and may contribute to the varied cognitive , executive function and extra-motor symptoms commonly seen in [Y] patients .

Our results demonstrate that BNN27 -LRB- muM -RRB- attenuated loss of motor neurons co-cultured with astrocytes derived from human [Y] patients with [X] mutations via the reduction of oxidative stress .

The cytoplasm abnormal [X] protein aggregates appeared in [Y] patients carrying [X] mutations .

CONCLUSIONS : This work highlights that [Y] alters [X] protein expression , mitochondrial function , and increases the ROS level even in peripheral tissues outside the central nervous system .

Mutations in the copper/zinc -LRB- CuZn -RRB- superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene account for ~ % of FALS cases and the mutant [X] mouse model has been used extensively to help understand the [Y] pathology .

Superoxide Dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- - Derived Peptide Inhibits Amyloid Aggregation of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the death of the upper and lower motor neurons .

Superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is an [Y] pathogenic protein , whose misfolding results in the formation of amyloid aggregates .

The mechanism underlying [X] pathogenesis in [Y] remains obscure , but one possible mechanism involves gain-of-interaction , in which the misfolded soluble [X] forms abnormal protein-protein interactions -LRB- PPIs -RRB- with various cellular proteins , including with other [X] molecules , thereby interfering with their function .

All patients identified with mutations of CHCHD10 gene were screened for mutations of the common [Y] causative genes including C9orf72 , [X] , TARDBP , FUS , PFN1 , and SQSTM1 .

Mutations in a large number of genes have now been linked to [Y] , including [X] , TARDBP -LRB- TDP-43 -RRB- , FUS and C9orf72 .

Our results show that the docking of the electrostatic loop to the rest of [X] plays a role in [Y] pathogenesis , in support of that structure acting as a solvent barrier for the metal site .

A Japanese familial [Y] patient with autonomic failure and a p.Cys146Arg mutation We describe a Japanese man with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- associated with a p.Cys146Arg mutation in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase gene -LRB- [X] -RRB- .

Thus , autonomic failure due to neuronal loss in the intermediolateral nucleus could present in patients with [Y] associated with certain mutations in [X] .

New links between [X] and metabolic dysfunction from a yeast model of A number of genes have been linked to familial forms of the fatal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- .

We also show that myofibers with dynein impairment or from an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- model -LRB- [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- -RRB- show similar defects in myofiber formation and agrin-induced AChR clustering suggesting a role for dynein impairment in [Y] progression .

Changes in the Expression of FUS/TLS in Spinal Cords of [X] G93A Transgenic Mice In order to searching the possible pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , we examined the expression and distribution of FUS/TLS protein in the different anatomic regions , segments and neural cells of adult spinal cord at the different stages of the [X] wild-type and G93A transgenic mice using the fluorescent immunohistochemistry .

METHODS : We chronically treated male and female transgenic mice model of [Y] , [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mice , with AMD3100 .

Mutations in superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- have been identified to cause [Y] .

Numerous different gene mutations have been found in familial cases of [Y] , such as mutations in superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , TAR DNA-binding protein -LRB- TDP-43 -RRB- , fused in sarcoma -LRB- FUS -RRB- , C9ORF72 , ubiquilin-2 -LRB- UBQLN2 -RRB- , optineurin -LRB- OPTN -RRB- and others .

Post-paralysis tyrosine kinase inhibition with masitinib abrogates BACKGROUND : In the [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- mutant rat model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , neuronal death and rapid paralysis progression are associated with the emergence of activated aberrant glial cells that proliferate in the degenerating spinal cord .

Importantly , these results suggest that oxidative stress may play a key role in development of [Y] , with the mutations in the [X] gene being an additional factor .

Susceptibility of Mutant [X] to Form a Destabilized Monomer Predicts Cellular Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the rapid and progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons in the spinal cord , brain stem and motor cortex .

The first gene linked to [Y] was the gene encoding the free radical scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- that currently has over , mostly missense , ALS-associated mutations identified .

A hallmark of SOD1-associated [Y] is the deposition of [X] into large insoluble aggregates in motor neurons .

Distinct conformers of transmissible misfolded [X] distinguish human SOD1-FALS Evidence of misfolded wild-type superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- has been detected in spinal cords of sporadic [Y] -LRB- sALS -RRB- patients , suggesting an etiological relationship to SOD1-associated familial [Y] -LRB- fALS -RRB- .

Slice cultures from G85R-SOD1 : YFP mice exposed to spinal homogenates from patients diagnosed with [Y] caused by the A4V mutation in [X] developed robust inclusion pathology , whereas spinal homogenates from more than sALS cases and various controls failed .

Alpha-synuclein and Cu , Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- are both aggregation-prone proteins that are associated with Parkinson 's disease -LRB- PD -RRB- and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , respectively .

Experiments performed with FDB fibers obtained from early-symptomatic [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- and skeletal muscle autonomous MLC/SOD1 -LRB- G93A -RRB- mice support the idea that events occurring locally in the skeletal muscle contribute to the impairment of CaV1 function in [Y] muscle independently of innervation status .

Some of ALS-related genes such as TARDBP or [X] among others have important roles in the regulation of glucose and fatty acids metabolism , so that an impairment of fatty acids -LRB- FA -RRB- consumption and ketogenic deficits during exercise in [Y] patients would connect the physiopathology with some of the more intriguing epidemiological traits of the disease .

Neuronal vacuolization and glial activation are pathologic hallmarks in the superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- mouse model of [Y] .

Here , we show for the first time that the expression of RAGE is higher in the [X] transgenic mouse model of [Y] vs. wild-type mouse spinal cord .

Our findings reveal that treatment of [X] transgenic mice with soluble RAGE -LRB- sRAGE -RRB- , a natural competitor of RAGE that sequesters RAGE ligands and blocks their interaction with cell surface RAGE , significantly delays the progression of [Y] and prolongs life span compared to vehicle treatment .

Several proteins misfold and are associated either genetically or pathologically in [Y] , including superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , Tar DNA binding protein-43 -LRB- TDP-43 -RRB- , Ubiquilin-2 , p62 , VCP , and dipeptide repeat proteins produced by unconventional repeat associated non-ATG translation of the repeat expansion in C9ORF72 .

Approximately % of familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- , which leads to misfolding of the [X] protein , resulting in a toxic gain of function .

Finally , AAV9 : : IGF-2 delivery to muscles of [X] -LRB- G93A -RRB- [Y] mice extended life-span by % , while preserving motor neurons and inducing motor axon regeneration .

The Voltage Dependent Anion Channel isoform -LRB- VDAC1 -RRB- in the outer mitochondrial membrane is a docking site for [X] G93A mutant in [Y] mice and the physiological receptor of Hexokinase I -LRB- HK1 -RRB- , which is poorly expressed in mouse spinal cord .

Our results demonstrate that HK1 competes with [X] G93A for binding VDAC1 , suggesting that in [Y] spinal cord the available HK1-binding sites could be used by [X] mutants for docking mitochondria , producing thus organelle dysfunction .

This NHK1 peptide specifically interacts with VDAC1 , inhibits the [X] G93A binding to mitochondria and restores the viability of [Y] model NSC34 cells .

[X] mutations lead to [Y] by a dominant gain of cytotoxicity but its mechanism still remains elusive .

Very recently , the abnormal insertion of [X] mutants into ER membrane has been functionally characterized to trigger ER stress , an initial event of a cascade of cell-specific damages in [Y] pathogenesis .

Our data indicate that [X] is directly or indirectly involved in [Y] oligodendrocyte pathology and suggest that in this cell type , some damage might be irreversible .

Therefore , [X] mutations were present in % of familial [Y] patients and % of sporadic [Y] patients , while FUS mutations were responsible for % of familial [Y] cases , and TARDBP mutations were rare in either familial or sporadic [Y] cases .

The approach is applied to the dynamic beta-barrel of [X] , associated with pathologic aggregation in the neurodegenerative disease [Y] .

A proportion of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- cases result from impaired mutant superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- maturation .

By contrast , NAA/Cho is reduced in patients with [Y] -LRB- % , p = -RRB- , but not in presymptomatic [X] + subjects compared to controls .

Considering the late onset of symptoms as well as the phenotypic variability among patients with identical [X] mutations , it is clear that nongenetic factor -LRB- s -RRB- impact [Y] etiology and disease progression .

The distinct sensitivities of [X] variants to glutathionylation , a modification that acts in part as a coping mechanism for oxidative stress , suggest a novel mode by which redox regulation and aggregation propensity interact in [Y] .

Our previous work indicated that different [Y] [X] mutant mouse models differ in disease pathogenesis ; therefore in this study we measured the effect of DR and Rapa in a second [Y] mutant mouse model -LRB- the H46R/H48Q mutant -RRB- .

These findings suggest that : -LRB- -RRB- the effect of DR in [Y] is not mediated through pathways common with Rapa , -LRB- -RRB- the deleterious effect of DR and Rapa in the G93A [Y] mouse model may not be universal to disease caused by all [X] mutations , and -LRB- -RRB- the results reinforce our previous conclusions that the pathogenic mechanisms in G93A and H46R/H48Q mice are distinct .

We conclude that these neurotoxins act through different transcriptional inductions , and these changes may reflect an adaptative cellular response to the cellular stress induced by the neurotoxins involved in [Y] in the presence of mutant human [X] .

SUBJECTS : We analyzed spinal cord sections from clinically and pathologically diagnosed [Y] cases and [Y] transgenic mouse models overexpressing ALS-linked [X] mutations G93A or L126Z .

Since there is evidence for the involvement of non-neuronal cells in [Y] , we searched for signs of [X] abnormalities focusing on glia .

Spinal cords from nine [Y] patients carrying [X] mutations , patients with sporadic or familial [Y] who lacked such mutations , and controls were examined by immunohistochemistry .

Misfolded [X] in the form of granular aggregates was regularly detected in the nuclei of ventral horn astrocytes , microglia , and oligodendrocytes in [Y] patients carrying or lacking [X] mutations .

The results suggest that misfolded [X] present in glial and motoneuron nuclei may generally be involved in [Y] pathogenesis .

Mitochondrial redox signalling by p66Shc mediates ALS-like disease through Rac1 Increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are among the mechanisms whereby mutant [X] -LRB- mutSOD1 -RRB- associated with familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- induces motoneuronal death .

Decreased stability and increased formation of soluble aggregates by immature Protein aggregation is a hallmark of many diseases , including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- , where aggregation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- is implicated in causing neurodegeneration .

Recent studies have suggested that destabilization and aggregation of the most immature form of [X] , the disulfide-reduced , unmetallated -LRB- apo -RRB- protein is particularly important in causing [Y] .

However , the proposed role of astrocytes in the pathology of [Y] derives in part from rodent models of FALS based upon dominant mutations within the superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- gene , which account for < % of all [Y] cases .

Two percent of [Y] cases are caused by the dominant mutations in the gene for superoxide dismutase -LRB- [X] -RRB- through a gain of toxic property of mutant protein .

G37R [X] mutant alters mitochondrial complex I activity , Ca -LRB- + -RRB- uptake and ATP Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- [Y] -RRB- is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective death of motor neurons .

Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 -LRB- [X] -RRB- cause familial [Y] but the molecular mechanisms whereby these mutations induce motor neuron death remain controversial .

Together , these findings suggest that the mechanism linking mutant G37R [X] and [Y] involves mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency resulting in ATP loss and impairment of mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca -LRB- + -RRB- homeostasis .
